2016-05-01,Anti-Semitism row 'damaging Labour',https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36180572,"Labour's candidate for Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has warned that the anti-Semitism row engulfing his party has harmed his chances of being elected.Mr Khan said comments made by ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone had made it ""more difficult"" for Jewish voters to support him in next week's mayoral election.The new Israeli ambassador to London also said elements of left-wing parties were ""in denial"" about anti-Semitism. It comes after Mr Livingstone stood by his comments about Hitler and Zionism.Mr Livingstone said Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s ""before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews"".In an interview with the Observer, Mr Khan said he accepted Mr Livingstone's comments about Hitler would make it harder for some people to feel the Labour Party is the ""best place for them"".""There are too many examples in our party of people having these views, and action does not appear to have been taken quickly enough,"" he said.Asked if the controversy would affect his chances, the Labour MP for Tooting said: ""Of course it does.""What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?What is the Labour anti-Semitism row about?Who is Ken Livingstone?Meanwhile, Israel's new ambassador to Britain, Mark Regev, told the Sunday Times he had ""no doubt that part of the left is in denial"" about anti-Semitism.""They say 'anti-Semitism, that's the right, that's the fascists'. That's a cop-out. It doesn't stand up to serious historical examination,"" he said.""When it does raise its ugly head, it should be condemned across the board.""And failure to condemn has to be in itself condemned,"" he added when asked if Mr Corbyn had done enough.Israel's Labour leader Isaac Herzog also said he had been ""appalled and outraged by the recent examples of anti-Semitism by senior Labour Party officials"".Mr Livingstone's comments were ""horrific and unthinkable for a British politician in the 21st century"", he added.The anti-Semitism row within the Labour Party erupted after Bradford West MP Naz Shah was suspended on Wednesday for comments she made about Israel.On Thursday, Mr Livingstone defended her in a BBC interview, saying that she was not anti-Semitic.He went on to say: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel.""Mr Livingstone was subsequently suspended but has stood by his recent comments, saying he was ""not sorry for telling the truth"".He blamed the row on ""embittered Blairite MPs"" seeking to scupper Labour's chances at the ballot box and prompt a leadership challenge.He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him in front of TV cameras of being a ""Nazi apologist"".Labour has said it will hold an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in its ranks.That inquiry, led by Shami Chakrabarti - former head of human rights campaign group Liberty - will consult with the Jewish community and other minority groups."
2016-05-01,Industrial action threat over academies,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36176846,"Head teachers have threatened industrial action over plans to make all state schools in England academies, after heckling Education Secretary Nicky Morgan at their conference.National Association of Head Teachers delegates said ministers were simply not listening to their concerns.Mrs Morgan's speech was met with cries of ""rubbish"" as she talked about the academies programme and testing.""I hear the strength of feeling in the hall,"" she said.The government has said that all schools will either have to convert to academy status - which sees them funded by the Department for Education but run by a governing body or trust independent from the local authority - by 2020 or commit to doing so by 2022.What does it mean to be an academy school?Nottinghamshire head Janice Turner urged delegates at the conference to back a call on the possibility of industrial action.She said: ""For a long time we've been bribed, we've been threatened, we've been blackmailed and we've been punished.""We have no further means other than to say an absolute 'no  - you can't do this to us'.""Head teachers highlighted the opposition to the plans from Labour and some Conservative MPs and councillors, and urged schools to get involved in letter-writing campaigns.The union also said it would call for a public inquiry into the merits of the academies programme.Mrs Morgan's appearance at the conference came as primary schools grapple with a new set of national tests for seven and 11-year-olds that are due to take place in the next two weeks.The education secretary apologised for the accidental publication of the Key Stage 1 Sats spelling paper on a government website, revealed last week, as she addressed the conference.And she said she understood how much change primary heads had been dealing with this year.""I recognise there have been a lot of changes - there's a new curriculum, a new way of assessment and new tests,"" she said.In a question-and-answer session after her speech, Mrs Morgan was asked if she would tweak the wording of the new English assessment, to be taken by half a million 11-year-olds, so that fewer children would be deemed to have failed.Simon Kidwell, head of Hartford Manor Primary School, Cheshire, called for writing assessments to be judged more leniently  to ""empower the teachers to make a judgement that will reflect a child's true ability"".When she said she was not minded to make the changes, Mr Sidwell called out: ""Are you in charge of the department or is Nick Gibb?""Mrs Morgan replied angrily: ""I am not going to dignify that sexist question with a response.""This was met with gasps and grumbles from heads gathered in the hall, who had previously been clapping the questioner.Mr Gibb is the schools minister, and testing and accountability are part of his brief.By Branwen Jeffreys, BBC News education editor With an audience of head teachers it was never likely to be a highly rowdy affair.But with their complete silence as Nicky Morgan walked on stage, low cries of ""rubbish"" and then loud outraged laughter as she answered questions, head teachers here at the NAHT conference in Birmingham made clear quite how disillusioned they're feeling.It's not just the plans to force all schools to become academies, which will affect primary schools most, as few have chosen to go down that route.It's also the changes, delays and uncertainty around primary testing which have left the Department for Education looking ham-fisted.Read more from BranwenThe education secretary said the tests were a vital part of raising standards.Heads have been concerned the toughening of Key Stage 2 tests, the results of which are used to hold schools to account, would lead to thousands more schools being labelled failing.Mrs Morgan said the department would hold the percentage of schools to be deemed failing virtually flat, at only 1% more.NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby told reporters afterwards: ""That's very significant. There's a lot of people who will have been thinking that tens of thousands of schools are going to fail.""But there was much vocal anger from delegates who believe standards have been made too hard.Mr Hobby said he was ""worried at the moment about the gap that's widening between the profession and the government"". He said: ""Academy status is appropriate for some, but mere conversion doesn't guarantee success. ""What counts is hard work and a clear plan for improvement - both of which can be achieved without conversion.""He said the motion empowered the NAHT to press the government hard on the detail of the plans.""The secretary of state has said her door is always open and that she will listen. Now she needs to honour her offer.""The NAHT has only taken strike action twice in its history. There was joint action with public sector unions in 2012, and a boycott over Sats tests in 2011."
2016-05-01,MPs invite Green to answer BHS questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36180520,"Former BHS owner Sir Philip Green has been invited to appear before two parliamentary committees to answer questions about the high street chain's collapse into administration.Sir Philip owned BHS - which went into administration on Monday - for 15 years before selling it for £1 in 2015.The work and pensions and business committees have asked to question him.Work and pensions committee chair Frank Field said MPs would ask ""how and where money went out of the company"".Last week BHS was put into administration amid falling sales, huge debts and a pensions deficit of £571m - putting around 11,000 jobs at risk.Since then, Sir Philip has been criticised by some MPs for paying out large dividends while its deficit was growing.Current owner Dominic Chappell, Tina Green - Sir Philip's wife - and BHS trustees will also be invited to appear as witnesses before the cross-party committees.Last week, the Work and Pensions Select Committee launched an inquiry into the collapse of BHS.Meanwhile, the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Select Committee announced an inquiry into the sale and acquisition of the firm. Sir Philip Green: From 'King of the High Street' to 'Unacceptable Face of Capitalism''What we'll miss if BHS closes'BHS: What are the next steps?Pension scheme at heart of BHS woesSimon Jack: Broken promises at BHS?Mr Chappell - the majority shareholder of Retail Acquisitions - bought BHS for £1 from Sir Philip last year, taking on a £571 million pension deficit.On Wednesday, Mr Chappell said he was preparing a bid to buy BHS out of administration.He told the BBC the administrators had been informed and talks with US-based investors were at a ""mature"" stage.It comes as MPs have said they will also investigate how the collapse of BHS will affect the Pension Protection Fund - which provides compensation for pensioners when companies go bust.Separately, the Pensions Regulator will investigate whether BHS's former owners sought to avoid their obligations.BHS, which employs about 11,000 people, will continue trading while the administrators seek a buyer for the business.The administration means members of the pension scheme who are yet to retire will be paid a less generous pension.One Labour MP John Mann, and member of the Treasury select committee, said Sir Philip must repay £400m of dividends that were paid out of BHS, or give up his knighthood.Sir Philip has offered to make an £80m voluntary contribution.Conservative MP Richard Fuller also called on Sir Philip to clarify his involvement in the chain's demise. ""Green and Arcadia need to put out a statement immediately clarifying their position. He has a responsibility, a duty,"" he said last week."
2016-05-01,"City to 'thrive' after Brexit, say bosses",https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36173263,"More than 100 business figures have thrown their weight behind the campaign to leave the EU, arguing the City would ""thrive and grow"" outside the EU.Ex-HSBC boss Michael Geoghegan, former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson and the stockbroker Peter Hargreaves are among those backing a Leave vote on 23 June.Excessive regulation, they argue, poses a threat to London's pre-eminence in the global financial services industry.The Remain side says EU exit will lead to job losses and reduced investment.Earlier in the referendum campaign, those wanting to stay in the EU claimed the support of 36 FTSE 100 bosses - while employers group such as the CBI and EEF also back the UK's continued membership. The debate around the economy has focused on the impact on the UK and its key industries of leaving the EU and what trade deals the UK will be able to negotiate when - as envisaged by Leave campaigners - the UK leaves the EU's single market. The government has said leaving the EU will be a drag on economic growth and leave households thousands of pounds worse off than they otherwise would have been. Leave campaigners have said this is scaremongering and now 110 business figures have signed a letter to the Evening Standard, arguing that far from damaging the City of London, exiting the EU would allow it to consolidate its position as the world's largest international financial centre.Speaking in a ""personal capacity"", the signatories - including company chief executives, fund managers and economists - say they have a ""material interest"" in maintaining the City as a vibrant and competitive place to do business and warn the EU is going in the wrong direction and puts this at risk. ""The EU is now shackled to the euro, a project doing damage to the social and economic fabric of member countries, including high youth unemployment, "" they write.""Meanwhile there is scant evidence that the EU will foster or support the kind of innovation which is essential if Europeans are to compete with the rest of the world. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.""Specifically, we worry that the EU's approach to regulation now poses a genuine threat to our financial services industry and to the competitiveness of the City of London.""They conclude: ""Assuming good political leadership and an effective regulatory environment, we believe that the City is most likely to strengthen its lead as the world's largest international financial centre, and continue to make a major contribution to the UK economy and employment, outside the EU but with continued access to its capital markets.""Britain Stronger in Europe said Leave supporters had ""given up"" trying to sound credible on the economy amid the overwhelming evidence that the UK would get a ""worse deal"" if it left the EU's internal market.Just hours before Vote Leave released the letter, UKIP leader Nigel Farage - also a supporter of EU exit - warned the campaign group they risked losing the referendum unless the terms of debate were shifted from the economy to immigration.He challenged them to hit their Remain opponents where they were ""weakest"" on the issue of ""open-door"" immigration but questioned the ability of the senior Conservatives to do this given the government's record on failing to reduce migration levels."
2016-05-01,Major in North Korea Brexit claim,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36168487,"Sir John Major has told those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU to ""go to North Korea"" if they want ""undiluted sovereignty"".The former Conservative prime minister said ""splendid isolation"" would leave the UK weaker.And he warned of economic damage if the UK votes to leave in the 23 June referendum.Vote Leave said Sir John had been ""wrong on nearly every EU issue over the last 20 years"" and was wrong now.Reality Check: Do we export five times as much to EU as to Commonwealth?Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir John said: ""Day after day you have had the Brexit people producing soundbites that are either offensive or inaccurate or just plain silly.""I don't believe that it is patriotic to argue for a case that is going to make this country weaker and is going to make the wellbeing of this country less certain in the future.""He went on: ""To listen to them, you would think we are entrapped in the clutches of an evil empire, not in a democratic partnership with our European neighbours whose sunshine and pavement cafes we enjoy during holiday breaks.""How far the UK has the ability to make its own laws and decide how it is governed. The Leave campaign has said leaving the EU would restore sovereignty to the UK, freeing it from the influence of Brussels and the European Court of Justice, which oversees the application of EU-wide rules.But Sir John said: ""If you want undiluted sovereignty in the modern age, when everybody is interconnected, then go to North Korea because that is where you will get it.""It is certainly true that we share sovereignty. We take some sovereignty from other people, we share some of ours.""We haven't surrendered it because, at the end of the day, the House of Commons, our representatives, can say, 'We won't have this, we will leave the European Union.' ""But in the modern world, the modern world of interconnectivity, the modern world with the economy that now exists, you have to share sovereignty or you find yourself isolated and weaker.""Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott said: ""John Major complained about soundbites before descending in hyperbole about North Korea without even a hint of self-awareness. ""John Major has been wrong on nearly every EU issue over the last 20 years. He said Britain should join the ERM - that was a disaster which cost 3 million their jobs. This issue covers defence and the extent of Britain's influence in the world""He signed us up to Maastricht saying it wouldn't give up sovereignty and he refused to rule out joining the euro. ""Now he doesn't want to take back control and stop handing Brussels £350m a week. He was wrong then and he is wrong now.""  It comes as UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed he had been sidelined by Vote Leave, which is the officially designated campaign to get Britain out of the EU.He said in a speech that Vote Leave was on the ""back foot"" because it had failed to focus on immigration - but it had rejected his offers of help. ""Every time I attempt to work with them I am rebuffed and rejected,"" he added.A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""We wish Nigel well."""
2016-05-01,Farage blasts Vote Leave campaign,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36167329,"Nigel Farage has accused the official EU leave campaign of not focusing hard enough on immigration. The UKIP leader said Vote Leave had been ""too defensive"" and needed to speak about the EU's ""open borders"" to take the fight to the ""enemy"".He said the Cabinet ministers in Vote Leave lacked credibility because of the government's record on immigration.Mr Farage is not part of Vote Leave and is running his own UKIP campaign for an exit vote in 23 June's referendum.In a speech in Westminster, he said Vote Leave - a cross party campaign headed by Conservative ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - had spent too much time ""defending their own goal"" from their opponents' economic attacks.He urged them to ""get onto the other side of the pitch"" and start making a more assertive case over immigration. He said: ""Where the enemy are at their absolute weakest is on this whole question of open door migration, the effect that it's had on the lives of ordinary Britons over the course of the last decade and the threat that it poses given the new terror and security threat that we face in the west.""I'm sorry to say that at the moment they don't appear to have done it.""This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.He accused the Remain campaign of a ""remorseless torrent of propaganda"", attacking the OECD and the International Monetary Fund as ""overpaid useless people"" and President Obama of ""parroting the Number 10 line"" after he spoke out against a UK exit.Raising the New Year's Eve sex attacks in Cologne and warnings of extremists ""posing as migrants"", he said migration, terror and the security threat was the ""weakest"" point for the Remain campaign.UKIP-backed Grassroots Out missed out on being designated as the official Leave campaign when the Electoral Commission instead chose Vote Leave after a bitter battle between the rival Brexit camps.Mr Farage said Vote Leave did not have the ""credible voice"" to speak out on migration, given the government's attempts to reduce the overall numbers.He said he had reached out to Vote Leave, saying ""let bygones be bygones"", but ""every time I try to work with them I am rebuffed and rejected"". Fine, he added, ""we will make the arguments ourselves"". He also said the referendum result would be decided by the level of turnout and the Leave side must ""motivate"" its supporters to get out and vote on 23 June.  A Vote Leave spokesman said ""we wish Nigel well"" and insisted the campaign group was committed to creating a ""fairer and more humane"" immigration system outside the EU. Earlier this week Home Secretary Theresa May said EU membership made the UK ""more secure from crime and terrorism"".On security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners.She also said the free movement of workers within the EU makes it more difficult to curb immigration to the UK.Mr Farage seized on this comment in his speech, brandishing a UK passport which he said made it ""impossible"" to control the numbers arriving, claiming wealthy people living in London were happy with an influx of cheaper nannies, gardeners and labour.Former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major has, meanwhile, said the Leave campaign's ""splendid isolation"" approach would leave the UK weaker.He told Leave campaigners to ""go to North Korea"" if they want ""undiluted sovereignty""."
2016-05-01,UK democracy 'needs Lib Dem recovery',https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36174307,"Tim Farron has said it is ""in the interests of British democracy"" that the Lib Dems recover in next week's UK-wide elections. The Lib Dem leader conceded his party had ""a battle"" on its hands.But he said Labour's woes present it with a ""huge opportunity"" to show itself as ""an effective opposition"".He claims membership has increased by 50% since last year's general election, when the party was nearly wiped out at Westminster.In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Farron said the elections were ""important UK-wide"" because the country is faced with ""a divided and divisive Labour Party when we ought to be talking about a Conservative Party that's attacking junior doctors, reducing police numbers and effectively privatising our schools"".'Rolling up our sleeves'Told that voters do not know who he is, Mr Farron said: ""That's the job we have got. We've got a battle to get back to the centre of British politics and people's attentions and we can only do that by winning some elections.""He said it took former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown two to three years to get 50% name recognition. ""The point is you don't get prissy or pompous or selfish about this, you roll your sleeves up and get things done, and frankly given the state of Britain's most ineffective opposition in living memory - the Labour Party - it's in the interests of British democracy that the Lib Dems recover next Thursday. I hope we will.""Mr Farron also defended his party's use of the House of Lords to defeat government legislation despite describing it as ""undemocratic"".""We don't agree with first past the post or the way the House of Commons is elected but it's the system we've got so we will use it.""Britain goes to the polls on Thursday in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years. They are quite separate from the EU referendum, which is due to take place the following month (23 June).Here is a rundown of the elections taking place on 5 May:"
2016-05-01,Expenses fraud MEP jailed for four years,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-36167299,"An MEP who dishonestly claimed about £100,000 in expenses with a ""sustained pattern of stealing"" has been jailed for four years.Peter Skinner, 56, who was Labour MEP for the South East from 1999 to 2014, was found guilty of three charges after a trial at Southwark Crown Court.He claimed thousands of pounds for support staff, which actually funded jewellery, restaurants and hotel stays.Sentencing Skinner, of Snodland, Kent, the judge said he had abused trust.The politician made fraudulent payments of £10,000 a month to his wife from December 2007 until July 2009.This entitled him to claim secretarial or parliamentary assistance allowance.He also created a fake letter claiming his father was working for him, to justify his payments of £5,000 every three months, his trial heard.In total Skinner claimed £480,000 in expenses, about £100,000 of that was fraudulent.Kent Police said he bought a Land Rover Discovery for his ex-wife, and paid for a honeymoon to the United States and Hawaii for his second marriage.During sentencing, Mrs Justice Maura McGowan, said: ""You were trusted by the public and you abused that trust. ""You have not only damaged public trust in individual parliamentarians but also in the democratic institution itself.""This was a breach of trust of the worst kind - this was a sustained pattern of stealing from the taxpayer.""He was found guilty of one count of making a false instrument, one count of fraud and one count of false accounting.He now faces a confiscation hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act.A Labour spokesman said: ""Peter Skinner has clearly not upheld the high standards we would expect of an elected representative, he is no longer a member of the Labour Party.""Smartly dressed in a grey suit, former South East MEP Peter Skinner showed no emotion as he was sentenced to four years in prison.The judge, Mrs Justice Maura McGowan, said she accepted the prosecution's figures that the 56-year-old had defrauded the European Parliament of thousands.As he arrived at Southwark Crown Court for sentence this morning I asked him if he had anything to say to the people who had voted for him.He said: ""Obviously I have some worries about public trust in politicians but that is all I can say.""Asked if he was worried about going to prison he did not answer.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the sum involved was £500,000 rather than £100,000."

European Commission data shows Spain is the largest exporter to Cuba from the EU, with trade totalling nearly £750m last year. UK exports were £25m in 2015, £19m in 2014 and £22m in 2013.According to UK Trade & Investment, the top British products exported to Cuba came from the dairy, pharmaceutical, paper, drinks, optical, aluminium, and machinery sectors.It says the UK remains under-represented in the market compared with other EU nations, although ""significant trade"" of products goes through third countries.Last month Mr Obama became the first US president since 1928 to visit Cuba.For years, the US and Cuba were engaged in a bitter stand-off, triggered by the overthrow of US-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista by Communist leader Fidel Castro in 1959.The US broke off diplomatic relations and imposed a trade embargo."
2016-05-01,MPs criticise Right to Buy extension,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36163172,"The government's controversial plan to extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants has been sharply criticised by a group of MPs.A report from the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has questioned how the policy will be funded, and whether proper replacement homes will be built.The MPs also said there was evidence that Right to Buy could increase overcrowding for those in housing need.The government said it made no apology for encouraging home ownership.The idea of the scheme is to allow Housing Association tenants to buy their own homes, with discounts similar to those currently enjoyed by council tenants.Members of the Committee said there was also a danger that increased discounts for Housing Association tenants would lead to greater fraud.Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said the approach to paying for the policy was entirely speculative.""There are no costings or workings out. We are not talking about a 'back of an envelope' calculation - there is no envelope at all."" The policy has previously been criticised by the Local Government Association, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).It has also been rejected by the governments of Wales and Scotland.The government has said that the extension of Right to Buy - which is already being piloted in five areas of England - will be funded by councils selling off their most valuable council houses. It promised that all the homes would be replaced.But the MPs concluded that the government's commitment ""will not ensure that these will be like-for-like replacements"".They said new homes ""can be a different size and in a different area, and may cost more to rent"".Further details available here In their report, the MPs also said it would be difficult to replace homes on a one-for-one basis. They said such a target would require a five-fold acceleration in housing starts.As a result, the policy could ""lead to those in need of social housing suffering greater overcrowding.""But the government insisted that all the replacement homes would be built.""This government makes no apology for helping people into homeownership,"" said a spokesperson for the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG).  ""Our voluntary agreement with housing associations will mean 1.3 million tenants will have the chance to own their own home, while every home sold will be replaced with a new affordable property.""The scheme is due to be rolled out across England later this year."
2016-05-01,Tory MP: Government at rotten heart of EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36160136,"Downing Street has been accused by a senior Tory MP of ""selling"" policies for ""cash and political favours"".Bernard Jenkin claimed the government watered down the Trade Union Bill to ensure union support in its campaign to keep Britain in the EU.Mr Jenkin told MPs ""this stinks"" like ""cash for questions"" and showed the government was at the ""rotten heart of the European Union"".But Business Minister Nick Boles said his claims were ""not right"".He told Mr Jenkin, who is a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, that ""not every compromise is a conspiracy"".Mr Jenkin made his comments in the Commons on the day the Guardian published an article jointly written by Prime Minister David Cameron and the former TUC general secretary Sir Brendan Barber.In it, they say that ""very special circumstances"" have brought them together, adding that despite their political differences they are ""united in our conviction that Britain - and Britain's workers - will be better off in a reformed Europe than out on our own"".Last week the government backed down over plans to end the right of workers to pay union subscriptions by deducting them from their wages. MPs approved concessions to the Trade Union Bill on Wednesday following a series of defeats over the plans in the House of Lords. They included a climb-down on attempts to force all union members to ""opt-in"" to paying a political levy - which will now only apply to new members.Mr Jenkin told MPs in the Commons: ""Yesterday, the ministers' concession was wholly unexpected.""He questioned whether the changes were linked to reported claims that unions could donate up to £1.7m to the ""Labour In for Britain"" campaign to remain in the European Union. Mr Jenkin said: ""It has been confirmed to me through more than two independent sources that No 10 instructed these concessions to be made after the discussions with trade union representatives.""This being true would amount to the sale of government policy for cash and political favours.""He went on: ""This stinks, this reeks of the same as cash for questions. This shows this government really is at the rotten heart of the European Union.""But Mr Boles said the Cabinet Office had advised him there was no breach of the ministerial code and nothing for the prime minister's adviser on ministerial interests to investigate. Mr Boles said it was ""customary"" for ministers to have regular discussions with shadow ministers to discuss possible compromises that would secure the passage of a Bill. ""The Trade Union Bill is now in ping pong and, as is customary at such times, ministers have held regular discussions with shadow ministers to discuss possible compromises that would secure passage of the Bill and delivery of the commitments made in the Conservative Party's manifesto,"" the business minister said.Mr Boles also said that the TUC, GMB Unite and Unison had declared their support for remaining in the European Union before concessions were offered.He added that major opposition from peers, including prominent Conservatives, had encouraged the government to make concessions."

On BBC Radio 5 Live, Jim Naughtie and Anna Foster present an election special from 00:30.All the latest developments are on the BBC politics website, with rolling updates on the Election Live page.Until polls close, we are limited in what we report.There are also dedicated programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Anyone 18 or over on 5 May who is a British citizen living in the UK, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, or an EU citizen living in the UK, can vote in the English, Welsh, London or Northern Irish contests.  In Scotland, 16 and 17-year-olds are also eligible to vote.If you have received a polling card through the post then you are registered to vote. If not, you may need to check with your local authority that you are still on the electoral register, particularly if you have moved house recently. The deadline to register was Monday, 18 April.Most people vote in person at a polling station on the day. It is normally a local school or community centre - the location will be on your polling card. You do not need to take the polling card with you in order to vote.

Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up. SNP - 69 seatsLabour - 37Conservative - 15Lib Dems - 5Greens - 2What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.WalesWhat happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.Labour - 30 seatsConservative - 14Plaid Cymru - 11Lib Dem - 5What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game. What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.DUP - 38 seatsSinn Fein - 29UUP - 16SDLP - 14Alliance - 8Others - 3What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.Assembly seats after 2012 electionLabour - 12 seatsConservative - 9Green - 2 Lib Dem - 2 What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives.  The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance. The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 ""omnishambles"" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England. All seats are up for grabs in three councils: Sheffield, Knowsley and RotherhamMetropolitan boroughs: A third of council seats are up for election in 32 of 36 Metropolitan boroughs including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sunderland.

If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The by-election was triggered by the decision of Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly. Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May. What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.To find out more about these elections you can visit the Electoral Commission's About My Vote website."

2016-05-01,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-01,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-01,John Pienaar,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36172958,"After the shouting, screaming and recriminations of yesterday. After the ""Stair Wars"" in which a Labour MP waged running verbal combat with Ken Livingstone, and ignited questions about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the warring factions have suddenly fallen all but silent. Peace, though, has not broken out. Anything but.It's a momentary ceasefire. On both sides, people are keeping their heads down - judging it too dangerous to speak up.Today, Jeremy Corbyn cancelled his campaigning trip to Wales to avoid unwanted media attention. Media attention is supposed to be the point! The First Minister of Wales, Carwen Jones, admitted Mr Corbyn isn't a hit with everyone on the doorsteps. ""Yes there are some people saying to me I'm unsure about Jeremy Corbyn. There are others who take the opposite view. What we are finding is that fewer and fewer people are mentioning him on the doorstep.""Mr Corbyn's critics - and enemies - are also keeping quiet. In private their mood is ferocious. They want Ken Livingstone expelled, and Mr Corbyn to take anti-Semitism in the party more seriously. So why the phoney peace? Behind the scenes, fear is spreading of what some expect to be poor results for Labour in Thursday's elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities. ""Outside London, it's looking dire,"" one told me.  And now, Mr Corbyn's enemies - who are under constant watch by the leaders' allies - are anxious to avoid being blamed for making things worse by showing disloyalty to their embattled leader. They expect those accusations to be levelled anyway. There's mutual suspicion and hostility bordering on hatred between the rival wings and factions of the Labour Party. It's been a messy, chaotic few days. Acrimonious in public, worse in private. Some action is coming on Labour's approach to racism and anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn will speak out. Rule changes explicitly declaring zero tolerance of racism look likely. But there are fears a good deal of damage has already been done, and the Labour Party will pay a price at the polls. The election results, when they come, will inevitably be subjected to rival, probably diametrically opposing interpretations within the Labour Party. But from all I'm hearing from sources in the opposing camps, anything that can be read as a  poor night in Thursday's elections will escalate the in-fighting to a new pitch. A fierce confrontation over Labour's future direction and leadership now looks unavoidable."
2016-05-01,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36169692,"The claim: The UK exports five times as much to the EU as it does to the Commonwealth.Reality Check: Yes we do. The UK's exports of goods and services to the Commonwealth in 2014 were worth £47.8bn. The comparable figure for the EU was £228.9bn. It's worth noting that the UK does plenty of business with countries that are part of neither group - for example, we sell twice as much to the USA as we do to our biggest EU partner, Germany.On Friday's Today Programme, former Prime Minister Sir John Major said that the UK exports five times as much to the European Union as it does to the 52 countries of the Commonwealth.Is he right?Figures from the Office for National Statistics show our exports of goods and services to the Commonwealth in 2014 were worth £47.8bn.The comparable figure for the EU that year was £228.9bn, which is slightly less than five times the Commonwealth figure.So the figure the former prime minister used is accurate. But why did he choose this one? We have historical links with the Commonwealth, but our biggest customer in the Commonwealth is only our thirteenth biggest in the world.There are 52 other countries in the Commonwealth. We know from the ONS Pink Book (table 9.3) which are our biggest customers in the Commonwealth.

2016-05-01,Ken Livingstone profile,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-17539320,"Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended by the Labour Party over comments he made while defending an MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row, has a had long and often controversial political career. Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name - another being his nemesis, and Conservative successor as mayor, Boris Johnson.Like Mr Johnson, he cultivated a quirky public image, with his pet newts and appearances on chat shows. He even lent his nasal tones to a track on a best-selling Blur album.His way with a provocative soundbite was the making of him, propelling him to national prominence from the grey world of local government, but it has also got him into a lot of hot water over the years. Not for nothing is his autobiography called You Can't Say That.He was suspended from office as mayor for four weeks in 2006 for comparing a Jewish journalist to a concentration camp guard - a comment he continues to be unrepentant about, saying it was a ""fuss about nothing"". The suspension was overturned in court.He has also been repeatedly criticised for his decision to welcome controversial Muslim cleric Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who condoned suicide bombings, to London in 2005. He said it was part of an effort to improve relations with the Muslim world.He remains popular in left-wing circles as one of the few genuine socialists to have achieved real power in the UK - but he had largely disappeared from the political scene, following his defeat in 2012 mayoral contest, although he continued to be elected to Labour's ruling national executive committee.He was enjoying semi-retirement when his old friend and ally Jeremy Corbyn was unexpectedly elected Labour leader last year.The two go back a long way - they share the same political outlook and commitment to causes such as nuclear disarmament and Palestinian solidarity - and Mr Corbyn worked hard to get him to the top at the Greater London Council in the early 1980s.Age: 70Marital status: Married his long-term partner in 2009. Two children with current partner and three other children. Political party: LabourTime served as Mayor: Two terms from 2000-2008Previous jobs: MP for Brent East 1987-2001; leader GLC 1981-1986; London councillor; lab technician; journalist and broadcasterMr Corbyn drafted in advisers from Mr Livingstone's time in City Hall when he took on Labour's top job and Mr Livingstone himself became part of his inner circle.Before long, the former London mayor was back on the airwaves as Mr Corbyn's chief defender, in the face of attacks from Blairite opponents.He was also given a role on the party's defence review - but controversy, almost inevitably, followed.He faced a barrage of criticism from Labour MPs - including Mr Corbyn himself - for suggesting Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister who had suffered from depression, needed ""psychiatric help"" for suggesting he knew nothing about defence.An apology eventually came but Mr Livingstone was soon in trouble again, over comments on BBC One's Question Time about how the 7/7 London bombers ""gave their lives"" to protest against the Iraq war.He then came under fire from Labour colleagues for describing a donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis from a hedge fund as like ""Jimmy Savile funding a children's group"".It later emerged Mr Livingstone himself had accepted £8,000 from a hedge fund, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.Born in Streatham, south London in 1945, Kenneth Robert Livingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive before taking up a job as a lab technician working on cancer research in the Royal Marsden Hospital. In 1971 he was elected to Lambeth Borough Council and that was the start of a long career in politics. Over the next 10 years he served as a local councillor and then on Greater London council before becoming the leader of the GLC in 1981.After the GLC was abolished he crossed the River Thames to Westminster, winning the seat of Brent East in 1987. He had a child at the age of 57 with his long-term partner and later wife Emma Beal. At the time it was thought to be his first child but in 2008 it emerged that he already had three other children with another two women. Beal and Livingstone went on to have a second child in 2004. He always had a difficult relationship with his own party. Frequently critical of Neil Kinnock, his battle with the party leadership did not diminish under Tony Blair. In the run-up to the mayoral election of 2000 he failed to secure the Labour candidacy, losing out to the leadership favourite, Frank Dobson. Mr Livingstone declared that he would stand as an independent candidate, and so Labour expelled him from the party. Standing as an independent far from scuppered him, and he won with 58% of the vote. In 2000, Tony Blair had been critical of his prospects in office claiming he would be a ""disaster"". However Mr Blair had to eat his words when Livingstone was admitted back into the party ahead of the 2004 mayoral election which saw him re-elected. ""I think I should be big enough to say the prediction I made has not turned out right,"" Mr Blair said at the time. Mr Livingstone's flagship mayoral policy was the introduction of the controversial congestion charge in central London, later extended to west London. He unsuccessfully fought the Labour government as it introduced a public-private partnership plan for the London Underground.He was also involved with London's successful bid for the Olympic Games and in dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attack of 2005. Even his opponent Boris Johnson praised him for speaking up for London after 7/7 and the failed attack several weeks later.Mr Livingstone boasts achievements such as the introduction of the Oyster card for London transport, free use of public transport for under-18s in full-time education and a revival and increased usage of London buses. He also claims to have increased numbers of police on London's streets to a record level. He faced attack for his links with the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, signing an oil deal with him in 2007 and when he lost the mayoral election in 2008 taking up a position as a consultant to Chavez, advising on urban planning. Ken Livingstone has always divided opinion. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was the former GLC boss who invented the ""loony left"" and who brought about the council's abolition by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was ""ahead of his time"". The Sun newspaper once described him as ""the most odious man in Britain"".But he is still popular with many on the left of the Labour Party, who relished his role as a thorn in Lady Thatcher's side and for speaking his mind about his socialist beliefs, when all about him in the party were abandoning theirs.It is, perhaps, ironic that just as the Labour Party has started to come back to his way of thinking, he faces being excluded from it."

2016-05-01,Labour row,https://web.archive.org//web/20160501033130/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36160928,"The UK Labour Party has been at the centre of a row over anti-Semitism, including its relationship to anti-Zionism. What do these terms actually mean?Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone was suspended from Labour following a series of remarks about Israel, including the suggestion that Hitler supported Zionism before the Holocaust.It follows the suspension of Bradford West MP Naz Shah after it emerged she had once suggested, among other things, that Israel should be moved to the United States. The new president of the National Union of Students, Malia Bouattia, has also been heavily criticised for remarks she made about Zionists.Many in the Jewish community say the use of ""Zionist"" as a term of abuse reflects a rising tide of bigotry and racism directed at Jews. The Labour peer Lord Levy told the BBC's Newsnight: ""There can be criticism of the state of Israel, but anti-Semitism - using the word 'Zionist' as another form of anti-Semitism - frankly can no longer be tolerated."" Others - including Livingstone - argue anti-Zionism is not the same as anti-Semitism, and that it's wrong to mix up anti-Jewish prejudice with legitimate disagreement with the actions of the Israeli state.However, critics of anti-Zionists point out that sometimes particularly harsh criticism of Israel goes further than disagreement with policies, but rather denies the right of the Jewish state to exist.Speaking on The Daily Politics, the former London Mayor said: ""Don't confuse anti-Semitism with criticism of the Israeli government policy and treatment of the Palestinians.""It's a debate around which emotions run high. It's also obviously true that being a Zionist and being Jewish are not the same thing.There are Zionist critics of Israeli government policies, such as the occupation of the West Bank, the route of the separation barrier (which Israel is building in and around the West Bank and which it says is for security against Palestinian attackers, though Palestinian supporters see it as a device to grab land) and the building of settlements.Equally, there was Jewish opposition to the Zionist movement, which sought to establish a Jewish homeland, long before the state of Israel was declared in 1948. Today fringe ultra-Orthodox groups such as Neturei Karta oppose the state of Israel because they believe the true Jewish state will only be established with the coming of the Messiah.Likewise, some make the point that Zionism is a political project supported by plenty of non-Jews, including Western governments and many US evangelical Christians.But it's been widely argued that the term ""Zionist"" has, in some circles, become a code word for ""Jew"" and that bigotry against Jewish people has been expressed using the language of anti-Zionism.Khadim Hussain, a former Lord Mayor of Bradford, was suspended from Labour after he shared a Facebook post that referred to ""the six million Zionists that were killed by Hitler"". Alex Chalmers, a former co-chair of Oxford University Labour Club, said some members regularly used the word ""zio"" - despite it being regarded as an ethnic slur.Bouattia was attacked after it emerged that in 2011, she co-wrote a blog for a Friends of Palestine campaign group saying that ""the University of Birmingham is something of a Zionist outpost in British Higher Education"". She has also attacked ""Zionist-led media outlets"" - which critics said reflects anti-Semitic myths about Jewish conspiracies to control the media. On the other hand, it's regularly claimed that accusations of anti-Semitism are deployed to silence criticism of the Israeli government or to further other political ends.Pia Feig, of Manchester Jews for Justice for Palestinians, told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine programme that ""anti-Semitism has been used to quieten down and suppress my concern and the concern of other people for Palestinians"". In a statement after Livingstone's suspension, the Jewish Socialists' Group said accusations of anti-Semitism were being ""weaponised"" to attack the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.On the other hand, supporters of Israel ask why it's the Jewish state that is so widely singled out for criticism and not Iran, Russia, China or any other state attacked for their human rights record. Baroness Julia Neuberger told the BBC's Jeremy Vine show that anti-Zionism implies ""Jews have no right to self-determination, unlike other people"". Mark Wallace, writing for Conservative Home, said in practice it would mean either allowing Israel to be wiped out by its enemies or ""denying millions of Israeli Jews their home and deporting them"".Some anti-Zionists say Zionism itself is a racist ideology, because of how, in their view, the Palestinian people have been treated by the Israeli state. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign says it opposes all racism, including anti-Jewish prejudice and the ""the apartheid and Zionist nature of the Israeli state"" - although the PSC has itself been accused of racism for its anti-Zionist stance.Bouattia said she rejected claims of prejudice, adding that ""for me to take issue with Zionist politics is not me taking issue with being Jewish"" and that ""Zionist politics are held by people from a variety of different faiths, as are anti-Zionist politics"".Accusations of anti-Semitism continue to dog Labour. Vicki Kirby was forced to stand down as a parliamentary candidate after tweeting that Hitler was a ""Zionist God"". She was re-instated and then suspended again. Gerry Downing, who was expelled from the party, described ""Zionist politicians within the ruling classes of America and Europe"".Livingstone was accused of ""rewriting history"" over his remarks about Hitler supporting Zionism by Labour MP John Mann, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Anti-Semitism.Few would deny there are anti-Semites who call themselves anti-Zionists, or that it's possible to criticise Israel without being a racist or a bigot. But agreement on how exactly the two relate appears elusive.Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"

Any issues of misconduct will be taken very seriously.""Sir Philip bought BHS in 2000 for £200m, but sold the department store last year. BHS was 'crashed into a cliff''What we'll miss if BHS closes'Broken promises at BHS?The demise of BHS on the High StreetAt the time, there were questions over the lack of retail experience of Dominic Chappell and his team at Retail Acquisitions, which became the majority shareholder of the department store.A fortnight ago, the business fell into administration with debts of £1.3bn - including a pension deficit of £571m - putting 11,000 jobs at risk across 164 stores nationwide.Sir Philip is believed to have offered to provide about £80m to help plug the pension deficit. But he has already faced accusations that he crashed BHS ""into a cliff"", from the chairman of the Business Innovation and Skills Committee, Iain Wright.Meanwhile, Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said Sir Philip had contacted Parliament and ""indicated his willingness to come to Parliament to give oral evidence"" to a joint session of the Work and Pensions select committee and the Business, Innovation and Skills committee.No date had yet been set for his appearance. There were suggestions that the committees also wanted to quiz Sir Philip's wife, Lady Green. But Mr Field said he believed Sir Philip ""will be able to answer all of our questions on the operations of BHS's pension fund"". Ahead of Sir Philip's appearance, the Work and Pensions Committee is due to hear from the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, BHS Pension Trustees, and Mr Chappell.There is no suggestion that Sir Philip did anything illegal.However, on Friday, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer, Lord Myners, told the BBC Sir Philip had big questions to answer over his stewardship of BHS.Lord Myners said: ""The big question is whether when Philip Green sold BHS to a group of individuals with no retail experience, led by a former mini racing car driver and twice bankrupt person... that the pension scheme had enough assets to meet its liabilities.""He added: ""It is the responsibility of the owner to either make sure that the pension fund is adequately funded or that the new owner is going to take on that responsibility and is a fit and proper person with adequate funding and sensible plans to ensure that the deficit will be covered."""

2016-05-02,Universal Credit 'veering off track',https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36187916,"The government's flagship benefit reform has ""serious design flaws"" and has ""veered off track"" because of cost-cutting, a think tank has warned.The Resolution Foundation said Universal Credit could leave 2.5 million families worse off, some by more than £3,000 a year.It comes as the government announces a further expansion of the scheme.Welfare Secretary Stephen Crabb said the payment was ""transforming welfare"" and getting people into work faster.Universal Credit, championed by Mr Crabb's predecessor Iain Duncan Smith, aims to provide incentives for people to move off benefits and into work.Universal Credit replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance with a single payment.After delays hit the original timetable, it is being gradually rolled out across the country and is now available to new single jobseekers in every job centre across the UK.The latest target for a full roll-out is 2021.The Resolution Foundation, chaired by former Conservative minister David Willetts, said it had long supported Universal Credit, which it said would simplify welfare and boost work incentives.However, it said recent changes, ""which have been driven by the government's desire to secure further savings in the welfare budget... have taken it too far from its original purpose"".Unless design flaws are eradicated, it said, Universal Credit ""risks being reduced to little more than a very complicated vehicle for cutting the benefits bill"".It urged Mr Crabb to ""reclaim"" the reform from the Treasury.The report said while some of the current system's ""disincentives"" to return to work had been removed by the reform, the opposite was true for many families, particularly ""second earners"" in couples.While it predicted 2.5 million would be worse off, it said almost two million would fare better under the new regime.David Finch, the think tank's senior economic analyst, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while the benefit provided financial incentives to work, the incentives for people to increase their earnings were ""particularly weak"". He said people kept about 35p from each pound they earn and benefits were withdrawn when people started to work as little as five or 10 hours a week. Mr Finch added: ""There's a risk that people, particularly single parents, get trapped at quite low levels of pay and fail to progress. ""So while there may be an incentive for them to get into work, that incentive for them then to boost their earnings and progress in work is weak.""Mr Duncan Smith resigned as work and pensions secretary in March this year, citing pressure to ""salami-slice"" welfare.In his resignation letter, he said: ""There had been too much emphasis on money saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.""The government said more than 450,000 people had made a claim for Universal Credit so far, with more than 9,500 new claims made every week.Mr Crabb told the Today programme there had been changes to the scheme since it was launched in 2010, but said measures such as an increased tax allowance and the National Living Wage had ""transformed the landscape"" and would ""override"" the losses outlined by the Resolution Foundation.Mr Crabb said the latest expansion marked an ""important milestone"".He added: ""Universal Credit is transforming welfare and is central to our vision for our society where people of all backgrounds can earn a decent wage and provide for their families, with claimants moving into work faster and earning more than under the old system.""Our focus now is on continuing its expansion to all claimants.""Labour's shadow welfare secretary Owen Smith said cuts to Universal Credit had ""fatally undermined"" incentives to work.""The Tories should stop slapping themselves on the back for delivering cuts to working families right across the country and instead listen to Labour's calls for an urgent U-turn."""

2016-05-02,Farage: UKIP to win five seats in Wales,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36195492,"UKIP will win at least five seats on the Welsh Assembly as part of a UK-wide ""breakthrough"" in Thursday's polls, its leader Nigel Farage has said.He said his party was on course to win its first ever seats in Cardiff - where it is campaigning heavily - and in the Northern Ireland and London Assemblies.It was ""50-50"" whether the party would gain representation in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, he said.He declined to put a target on UKIP gains in English council elections.UKIP is campaigning on multiple fronts as it seeks to become the only UK party to get people elected to the National Assembly of Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as the Greater London Assembly.The party has focused much of its time and resources in Wales, where it won 13% of the vote in last year's general election.Opinion polls suggest UKIP is set to win seats for the first time despite a row over its candidate selection process.Mr Farage told the BBC's Daily Politics: ""There will be a breakthrough in Wales. I think we are going to win five seats - we may do slightly better than that. Let's see.""As for England, Mr Farage would not be drawn on how many seats it would gain but said its record in local government was a good one and he predicted it would consolidate its position in its existing strongholds in Essex and South Yorkshire.""We will make gains. To try and guess how many is virtually impossible. In Thurrock, I think we will become the biggest party on that council, in Rotherham we have a chance of becoming the biggest party on that council.""There are 500 local UKIP councillors. Our local base is growing, the people who have had elected have behaved, on the whole, pretty well and been very diligent and worked very hard. Yes, we will improve.""There has been speculation about the future of the party, and a possible change in direction, whatever the outcome of June's referendum on EU membership. Mr Farage said if there was a narrow vote to stay in the EU, a lot of Conservative and Labour supporters would be unable to reconcile themselves with the result and their party leadership's stance and UKIP could find itself ""a lot bigger than it is now"".If there was a vote to leave, he said UKIP would need to ""stay around"" to ensure that the people's will was ""implemented"" but he conceded that it would need to show it could talk about issues other than Europe. And he rejected suggestions that UKIP - which only managed to get one MP elected in last year's general election despite winning 12% of the vote - was treading water nationally, citing a recent YouGov opinion poll which put it on 20%.

2016-05-02,Liberty to bid for Tata UK steel assets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36189022,"Liberty House has confirmed it has formally submitted a letter of intent to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works.The head of Liberty, Sanjeev Gupta, was the first to express an interest when the assets were put up for sale.Earlier on Tuesday, a management buyout team also confirmed it submitted a bid.In addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport and Rotherham.About 4,000 people work at Port Talbot, some 1,300 at Newport, and about 1,200 at Rotherham. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside.Tata's Long Products division is in the process of being sold separately.In a statement Liberty said: ""Liberty believes the UK steel industry can achieve long-term viability if based on an agile, sustainable, non-cyclical model.""The company repeated its plans to move away from steelmaking in blast furnaces to recycling steel in electric arc furnaces. Liberty said it had appointed a panel of financial advisers led by international investment bankers Macquarie Capital (Europe) Limited, with the State Bank of India as co-financial advisers. Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was ""doing everything we can"" to secure a future for Tata's UK steel works.He has postponed a major trade visit to Iran to focus on the future of the steel industry. Asked by MPs if Tata would rush through a sale by the end of June, Mr Javid said he hoped the company would remain flexible about timing. ""They don't have an unlimited amount of time, but they do understand that it does take time,"" he said.Liberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta. While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started a trading company that has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals with other companies for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.A management buyout team, under the name of Excalibur Steel UK, has also confirmed it has registered a letter of intent with Tata expressing its formal interest in its UK steel assets. It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the previous head of Tata's UK strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs on the board.Mr Wilkie, chief executive of Excalibur, said in a statement: ""It was only two weeks ago we made the decision to pursue a buy-out that enables the management and staff to take a stake in the ownership and operation of a strategic British industry. ""We believe we have a large number of the pieces in place required to make this a success, including a management team with vast experience of steelmaking and processing.""The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1."

So, what are they pledging?Ahead of campaigning on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said that job creation would be at the heart of a re-elected SNP government's agenda.She added: ""As we have shown in recent months, we will relentlessly champion Scottish business and always stand up for our key industries.""And the only way people in Scotland can be sure of re-electing an SNP government with a bold, ambitious plan to create new and better-paid jobs is to cast both votes for the SNP on Thursday.""Voters go to the polls on Thursday to elect their new constituency and regional list MSPs.Ms Dugdale visited a soft play area in Glasgow where she is expected to warn of the threat ""the SNP's £3bn of cuts"" could have on education and frontline services.She said: ""The SNP must now come clean on their secret cuts by telling voters where the axe would fall.""A vote for Labour is a vote to use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to tax the richest 1% so we can invest in schools and stop the cuts to public services. A vote for the SNP is a vote for cuts to children's education, cuts to frontline services and cutting jobs.""The Scottish Conservatives hired a helicopter to take Ms Davidson from coast to coast where she will try to convince voters that she is the one opposition leader who can challenge the SNP.She said: ""Many people are supporting me because they just want an opposition at Holyrood which will really hold the SNP to account for once. Labour has had its chance - I am ready to step up and do a job for Scotland.""Mr Rennie insisted that the SNP had had nine years to ""get to grips"" with the challenges facing public services.He added: ""Everywhere I go, people tell me that they are pleased that we are talking about big issues like education and mental health that were neglected while the SNP campaigned for independence. ""The last thing Scotland needs is a groundhog day debate on the constitution.""With just two full days of campaigning to go, the Scottish Greens were keen to underline their manifesto commitment to ""invest in skills and new jobs"".The party's co-convener Mr Harvie said: ""Scotland's economy is facing huge challenges, not least from the inevitable decline in the oil and gas sectors, so the need for a plan of action has never been greater.""Today's visit [to Fife College] underlines the Scottish Green Party's manifesto commitment to investment in skills and new jobs that will last."""

""The economy needs to be reinvigorated, and our public services are verging on crisis - a crisis of Carwyn Jones' making.""Speaking in Wrexham on Monday, Mr Jones repeated his suggestion that the NHS was ""on the ballot paper"" on Thursday.He said: ""We know the health service has faced some challenges, in north Wales in particular. ""The last five years of Tory austerity have been difficult ones and the demand for healthcare is rising all the time. ""But, we have an NHS in Wales - and an NHS workforce - of which we can be proud.""There had been ""real improvements"" since 2011, he said, including a larger medical workforce and improved cancer survival rates.Plaid Cymru are focusing on a pledge to scrap care charges for the elderly and dementia sufferers.  The party wants to scrap both fees over a 10-year period, at a cost of £226m.Plaid's Elin Jones said: ""Our plans will save people up to £30,000 every year. It is a significant commitment, but it is a commitment that we believe is important to make.""Plaid Cymru will restore the values of the NHS, making care free at the point of need for everyone who needs it. ""This is about keeping the social contract with people who have worked all through their lives, have paid their taxes and who now need care.""Kirsty Williams, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""People don't expect miracles from our NHS, but they do expect staff to have the time to treat patients with the dignity they deserve. ""17 years of Labour has meant nurses in Wales have more patients each to care for than in any other part of the UK. That must change - a vote for the Welsh Liberal Democrats is a vote for dignified care.""The party is pledging to ensure a minimum number of nurses on mental health and  maternity wards. A private members' bill introduced by Ms Williams in the last assembly has already seen the policy adopted on general wards.UKIP, who are aiming to win their first seats in the Senedd, are due to be joined on the campaign by party leader Nigel Farage in Newport."
2016-05-02,‘Democracy deficit’ in low turnout wards,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35999707,"Fewer than one in five eligible voters in some parts of England previously chose anyone to represent them in local elections, raising fears of a democratic deficit.BBC News analysis of voting patterns in 2,500 council wards since 2012 shows wide disparities.Most of the areas where the fewest people voted in recent elections are in the North.The Electoral Reform Society said it was vital people turned out to vote.Campaigners are concerned there will be a low turnout again on Thursday 5 May if voters continue to see local authority elections as ""less important"" than a General Election.According to data from the commission covering the 2012, 2014 and 2015 council elections:Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area.41wards saw fewer than 20% of the electorate vote in 2012368,594 were eligible to vote 65,221 returned a ballot that year 4 wards had under 1/5 turnout in 2014, alongside European elections 43% was lowest turnout in 2015, when General Election took place too Get the data here.Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ""These figures show that there is a serious democratic deficit in local elections in England. ""Local authorities are central to running so many services - from adult social care, to waste, schools and transport -  and with many getting more powers, it's vital people turn out, hold them to account and have their say.""A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: ""Our research shows that recent home movers, young people, people from some black and minority ethnic communities, and people in rented accommodation are less likely to be registered to vote.""The commission ran a public awareness campaign encouraging people from these groups to go online and register, with more than 1.6 million applications made since 1 February.Despite the North having some of the least engaged voters, it also contained those at the top end.The ward with the best turnout overall was Old Laund Booth in Pendle, Lancashire, where 85% of registered voters used their ballot in 2015. However, the ward has only one councillor and therefore elections only take place every four years.Of those wards that held elections three years out of four, it was Bastwell in Blackburn that had the highest average turnout, 66%.Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, said the Bastwell turnout was encouraging and showed trends such as those seen in Liverpool Central could be reversed.He said: ""When we were in Liverpool there was real, entrenched cynicism among too many individuals. They believe that these civic institutions barely look like the people they are representing and they say it has nothing to do with them, which then makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy as they do not use their vote to change it.""Bastwell shows things can be turned around and offers us hope. But it has to be bottom up, diverse-led change. Change cannot be from community leaders herding people blindly into the polling booths.""A Liverpool City Council spokesman said the Central ward had a ""very large student population"", which suggested ""a lot of voter apathy among them for local elections"".It worked with the National Union of Students, visiting halls of residence and hired campaign group Operation Black Vote's bus to encourage people to register before the deadline on 18 April.In the 2012 council elections the national average turnout was 31%. Two years later, when the vote coincided with the European Parliament elections, it was 36%.And when the vote coincided with the General Election in 2015, average turnout rose to 65%. The lowest turnout in the country last year was Chalvey ward in Slough, where just under 43% voted.66%Average turnout over 3 elections75% Asian/Asian British residents Bottom 14% for deprivation Bottom 12% for employment Bottom 7% for education Ingrid Koehler, senior policy researcher at think tank the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU), said: ""It's disappointing, but not surprising, that some wards across the country appear disengaged based on voter turnout. It's important to remember that many people, including those who don't vote, have regular interactions with local government - far more so than with central government. ""Still, there are many systemic reasons why turnout in local elections is low. For too long, local government has been treated as the delivery arm of national government. As local devolution progresses, hopefully people will see more reason to make the effort to decide who represents them locally."""
2016-05-02,Welsh Labour appeal for 'left-wing' vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-wales-36182158,"Carwyn Jones has made a direct appeal to Plaid Cymru, Liberal Democrat and Green supporters to lend their votes to Labour.The Welsh Labour leader said left-leaning voters should side with his party to stop the Conservatives.With three days to go, other parties are attack Labour's record in office.Plaid said Labour had ""managed decline"" while the Lib Dems said Labour should be ""ashamed"" of its record on education.The Conservatives said Mr Jones' record on the NHS showed Labour were ""not up to the job"" of governing Wales.As the assembly election campaign enters its final week, Mr Jones used a speech in Wrexham - one of the Tories' target seats - to say Labour wanted to see an ""confident, open, outward looking Wales"".He repeatedly attacked ""the Tories, Plaid and UKIP"", but made no mention of the Liberal Democrats.  With polls suggesting that Labour will lose seats but remain the largest party, there has been some speculation that Mr Jones could seek to form a coalition with the Lib Dems after polling day.Mr Jones is keen to get his campaign back on track after Labour was rocked by claims of anti-Semitism last week.In Wrexham he said the outcome would be decided in Labour/Tory battleground seats such as the Vale of Clwyd and Gower.Opponents claim that under 17 years of Labour-led governments since devolution, standards in public services in Wales are not good enough.But Mr Jones returned to two main planks of his campaign: that Wales has avoided a junior doctors' strike and the impact of spending cuts imposed in Westminster.""So, if you're thinking about voting Liberal, or Plaid, or Green in the seats where it is a straight fight between Labour and Tory - think about that risk,"" he said.""Think about importing that kind of politics into the assembly. And lend us your vote in those constituencies to stop it.""Speaking on Sunday, Plaid leader Leanne Wood said: ""After seventeen years of managed decline in our public services, the people of Wales have a once in a generation opportunity to deliver real change for our nation.""Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said a generation of children had been ""left behind"" under Labour.She said: ""Ministers say they took their eye off the ball, casually accepting that a generation of young people have been let down due to Labour complacency. They should be ashamed.""Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Labour's management of the NHS proves they're not up to the job. ""The election this Thursday presents voters with their best opportunity in nearly two decades to deliver new leadership for Wales, and secure a strong, properly-funded NHS backed up by a strong economy. With Labour only one seat from losing power, a new start for our NHS is within reach.""The Welsh Conservatives are the only party to have made a manifesto commitment to safeguard the NHS budget and to increase spending on health services each and every year during the Assembly term."""
2016-05-02,Parents in primary school test protest,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36188634,"Numbers of parents have kept their children off school for the day in a protest about primary tests in England.More than 40,000 parents have signed a petition calling for a boycott of primary school tests, which are due to be taken later this month.Parents supporting the Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign have complained of a damaging culture of over-testing.Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says taking pupils out of school ""even for a day is harmful to their education"".It remains uncertain how many primary school children were kept off school across the country, but a social media campaign had urged parents to take children on educational activities for the day.About 500 people gathered at Preston Park in Brighton, including children's laureate Chris Riddell.""We should be turning children into readers with the pleasure that gives, rather than relying on a testing culture,"" said Mr Riddell.Parents have handed in the petition at the headquarters of the Department for Education in London. Among the parents present was Caterina, with son and daughter in Ivydale school in Nunhead, south London.She said the school was ""amazing and creative"" but there was now ""too much pressure"" on six and seven year olds.The campaign organisers say children are ""over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning"".They have raised concerns about the impact of primary tests, so-called Sats tests, taken by seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds, which are being made more stretching with changes to the curriculum.They have challenged what they claim is a ""dull, dry curriculum"" based around tests.In an open letter to the education secretary, campaigners have warned of schools becoming ""exam factories"" and that testing causes stress and can make young children feel like ""failures"".Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw rejected these arguments, saying that improving social mobility depended on making sure that children are not falling behind at any early age.""The government is right to introduce greater structure and rigour into the assessment process. Those who oppose this testing need to consider England's mediocre position in the OECD education rankings,"" said Sir Michael.""As I have long argued, children who fall behind in the early years of their education struggle to catch up in later years.""Education Minister Nick Gibb said tests improved standards and need not be stressful.""Schools should not be putting pressure on young people when taking these assessments.  ""I've been to many schools where the children don't even know they're taking the tests,"" said Mr Gibb. The importance of testing was emphasised by Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education.He said that any short-term stress was worth it if in the longer term it meant that children finished school with better results.Schools minister Nick Gibb was asked a question on BBC Radio 4's World at One from a grammar test for 11 year oldsMartha Kearney: Let me give you this sentence: ""I went to the cinema, after I'd eaten my dinner."" Is the word ""after"" there being used as a subordinating conjunction or a preposition?Nick Gibb: Well it's a preposition. Martha Kearney: I don't think it is.Nick Gibb: ""After"" is a preposition. It can be used in some contexts as a word that coordinates a sub-clause, but this isn't about me.Martha Kearney: But I think in this sentence it's being used as a subordinating conjunction.Nick Gibb: Fine, well this isn't about me, this is about ensuring that future generations of children - unlike me incidentally,  who was not taught grammar at primary school...Martha Kearney: Perhaps not.Nick Gibb: ...We need to make sure that future generations of children are taught grammar properly.""Mr McGovern said that tests in England's schools needed to be tougher to catch up with international competitors.""We're three years behind the Chinese at the age of 15. We are a bit of a basket case internationally.""We've got to do something, we've got to act early, and a health check at seven is a good idea.""Ministers have already had problems with the administration of primary school tests this year.The baseline tests, which were intended to be a benchmark for measuring progress, were found to have unreliable results and have been postponed.Tests for seven-year-olds in spelling, punctuation and grammar also had to be called off when it was found that test questions had mistakenly been published on a Department for Education website.Labour's shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said she did not ""condone children being taken out of school"".But she accused the government of ""creating chaos and confusion in primary assessment"".Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""I think the gap between the profession and the government has never been wider than it is at the moment.""He warned of ""an enormous number of mistakes, delays and confusions around testing"".But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has argued that raising standards will improve creativity and not restrict it.""How creative can a child be if they struggle to understand the words on the page in front of them?"" Mrs Morgan told head teachers at the weekend.""That is why the campaign led by some of those who do not think we should set high expectations, who want to keep their children home for a day is so damaging. ""Keeping children home, even for a day is harmful to their education."""
2016-05-02,Rich and poor lifespan gap 'widening',https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36170289,"The gap between the lifespans of rich and poor people in England and Wales is rising for the first time since the 1870s, researchers have suggested. Everyone is living longer but rich people's lives are extending faster, the City University London study says. Better life expectancy narrowed the gap in the early 20th Century but this trend reversed for men in the 1990s.Author Prof Les Mayhew from Cass Business School said the difference was mainly due to ""lifestyle choices"". Based on figures from the Human Mortality Database, researchers measured the differences in age between the youngest 10% of adult deaths and the oldest 5%. From 1870 to 1939 the gap steadily closed, the report said. ""Everyone benefited from improvements in clean drinking water, better housing, higher incomes and better health,"" said Prof Mayhew. After 1950 there were further rises in life expectancy - though inequalities in lifespan persisted rather than narrowing further. But in the 1990s lifespan inequalities actually worsened, particularly for men, for the first time since the late 1870s, say the researchers. They found that for men who died in 2010 aged over 30:For women who died aged over 30 in 2010: Commenting on the data, Prof Mayhew said: ""This is partly due to some men now living to exceptionally old ages and in many cases equalling women - but at the other end of the distribution there has been a lack of progress."" The researchers attributed the widening disparity to poor lifestyle choices.""Many of the big gains from public health improvements are in the past and personal choices are now much more important,"" the report says.""Men in lower socio-economic groups are the most likely to make damaging lifestyle choices. ""They put themselves in harm's way on average more than women do - they smoke more, drink more and there are periods in their lives when they partake in riskier activities,"" say the authors. The authors suggest lack of wealth is not directly responsible for the difference, but the poorest groups are more likely to suffer the cumulative effects of decades of poor lifestyle choices and income inequality - while wealthier, more educated people may find it easier to adopt healthier habits. The authors say the negative health outcomes of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet and lack of exercise ""are disproportionately associated with the poorest in society"". They say it is vital to encourage healthier lifestyles and to counter pressure on individuals from ""exposure to advertising, their communities and peer groups"". Baroness Sally Greengross, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre, said the figures were ""particularly worrying"".""Preventing inequalities in ill health and disability must be a priority for policy action,"" she said.A Department of Health spokeswoman said everybody should have the opportunity to have a long and healthy life.""The number of workless households is at a record low and we know that economic security can provide the foundation for better physical and mental health.""We have shown that we are willing to take tough action to protect the public's health."""
2016-05-02,A guide to 2016's elections,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35813119,"Britain goes to the polls in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years. They are quite separate from the EU referendum, which is due to take place on 23 June.Here is a rundown of the elections taking place on 5 May:Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area.Polls close at 22:00.

Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up. SNP - 69 seatsLabour - 37Conservative - 15Lib Dems - 5Greens - 2What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.WalesWhat happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.Labour - 30 seatsConservative - 14Plaid Cymru - 11Lib Dem - 5What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game. What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.DUP - 38 seatsSinn Fein - 29UUP - 16SDLP - 14Alliance - 8Others - 3What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.Assembly seats after 2012 electionLabour - 12 seatsConservative - 9Green - 2 Lib Dem - 2 What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives.  The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance. The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 ""omnishambles"" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England.

If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The by-election was triggered by the decision of Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly. Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May. What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.To find out more about these elections you can visit the Electoral Commission's About My Vote website."

2016-05-02,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.

Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post.

He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-02,Welsh election,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-36185480,"Virtually everyone I speak to who has been involved in the Welsh assembly election admits it has been difficult to get a handle on.The uncertainty facing thousands of Welsh jobs in the steel industry has become a dominant theme.And the profile given to the EU referendum has made it difficult for the parties to cut through.As a result, there are fears of a lower turnout than five years ago, when just 42% of people voted.The opposition parties wanted a campaign dominated by scrutiny of Labour's 17 years in power since the start of devolution.Instead, it has lacked continuity.Labour has based its campaign on the personality of its leader, Carwyn Jones, by asking voters who they think would make the best first minister.One of the big challenges the party faces is appearing fresh after so many years in government in Cardiff.The Conservatives, who have been the main opposition, are focusing on problems in health, as well as offering significant tax breaks when partial control of income tax is devolved.They have had to overcome divisions over Europe to try to keep the momentum they generated in Wales as a result of some eye-catching victories in the general election last year.Plaid Cymru has set out plans for a major restructuring of public services, including the NHS, in an attempt to integrate health and social care.The party needs to develop some kind of momentum after a number of recent disappointing election results despite the high profile given to its leader, Leanne Wood.The Liberal Democrats have run a campaign stripped down to a small number of pledges, including more nurses and smaller class sizes.The party's obvious challenge is convincing people it can bounce back from the devastating result in the general election.And UKIP, who could have a significant presence at the assembly for the first time, has published a detailed manifesto on devolved services such as health and education in an attempt to show it is serious about the assembly, and not just about  Europe.Welsh Labour manifestoWelsh Conservative manifestoPlaid Cymru manifestoWelsh Liberal Democrats manifestoUKIP Wales manifestoThe big question mark is whether its supporters, who are clearly motivated by the EU referendum, can be enthused enough to turn out for the assembly election on 5 May.Labour has half of the 60 seats at the assembly. Polls over the past 18 months have suggested it is running about 10 percentage points down, which will make it vulnerable in a number of marginal seats held by the Tories at a parliamentary level.The indications are Labour will continue to be the largest party, the question is whether it will have enough assembly members to govern alone or have to form a coalition with another party.The impact of UKIP in marginal seats has introduced a new degree of unpredictability, while the prospect of a low turnout means the outcome could be decided by relatively low margins.Unlike in Scotland, where the SNP appears to be on track for an overall majority, the picture in Wales is far more uncertain.Wales Green PartyAbolish the Welsh Assembly PartyMonster Raving Loony PartyTrade Unionist and Socialist CoalitionWelsh Communist PartyFor full listings of all candidates standing in Wales, use our Constituency and Region pages."
2016-05-02,Election turn-off,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-36047612,"Fewer than 20% of people have chosen to vote in council elections in some areas of England over the past four years, BBC News analysis of voting patterns has shown. Why are people turning their back on local elections and how can they be drawn back to the ballot box?There were 41 out of about 2,500 wards in England where not even a fifth of the electorate turned out to choose a local councillor in 2012. This was the last time the seats being contested on 5 May this year were elected.The Electoral Reform Society said this amounted to ""serious democratic deficit"" and it is vital people vote and hold authorities to account.So how does the country solve a problem like low turnout? BBC News looks at some of the options.Online voting would improve turn out, according to market research conducted among 2,000 non-voters before the 2015 General Election.""We found two thirds of those who did not vote in 2010 said online voting would make them 'more likely' to vote,"" said Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of the research company Survation.""Improving access in this way might be particularly important for the 9% of non-voters who said they were 'not able to access a polling station or get a postal ballot'.""A commission set up by the Commons Speaker John Bercow said that by 2020 ""secure online voting should be an option for all voters"".Electronic voting is used in Estonia, where about 30% of participants cast their ballot online. So-called e-voting in the country has grown in popularity, from 30,275 users in the 2007 parliament elections to 176,491 people in 2015, while overall turnout has risen from 61.9% to 64.2%.However, the Estonian government says research suggests it did not play a great role in getting more people to vote.Arne Koitmäe, an adviser in the elections department of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu, said: ""[Researchers] found that while the aggregate turnout did increase marginally, they cannot really claim that this was only down to e-voting as such. ""Their conclusion was that e-voting simply makes voting easier but it doesn't address the underlining causes of turnout decline and it will not necessarily engage those for whom the problem lies in politics as such.""In Australia, non-voters face fines of $20 (about £11), rising to $170 (about £93) plus costs if they fail to pay.  In the 2013 General Election, turnout was more than 93%, compared with 66.1% in the UK in 2015. However, Australian voters spoiled 5.9% of ballot papers, while the UK electorate spoiled just 0.2%.Labour MP David Winnick tried to make voting a ""civic obligation"" in the UK via a Private Member's Bill, but it never made it beyond the Commons.But the Civitas think tank is concerned it might turn voting into ""one more thing that the state requires us to do, like filling in a tax form or taking the car for its MOT"".93%Turnout in Australia$20Fine for not voting1924 was when Australia introduced the legal duty to vote 14 countries enforce participation 17 countries say voting is compulsory but it is not enforced And Dr Annabelle Lever, a former fellow at the London School of Economics, has argued compulsory voting could see people without strong views coerced into voting a certain way by others.Writing in the journal Public Reason she said: ""Most protest, and all voting, depends for its success on the behaviour of other people, many of whom we will not know, many of whom will have interests and beliefs quite at odds with our own, and over whose behaviour we have no influence. ""People must, therefore, have rights to limit their participation in politics and, at the limit, to abstain.""The council ward with the lowest average turnout in 2012 was Liverpool Central, according to data from the Electoral Commission.The city council blames the low turnout on ""voter apathy"" for local elections among the large number of students registered in the ward. The ward saw a big rise in turnout in 2015 when the council elections coincided with the General Election.Ellie Hughes, who stood as a prospective councillor in Manchester in 2014 when she was an 18-year-old student, said she had tried to encourage friends to vote but ""a lot of people didn't even know there was a council election"".However, impartial campaign group Bite The Ballot, which encourages young people to vote, says that far from ""apathy"", many students feel councils do not want to consult with them.Campaigns manager Abiodun Michael Olatokun said: ""Young people are not apathetic. They do care deeply about the area they live in, about the standard of housing, the number of police officers and so on. Local democracy needs to be repurposed and made more accessible, with more online consultation and more use of social media.""Members of BBC Generation 2016, hand-picked to represent a broad cross-section of young people in the UK, agreed there was an issue with student engagement. They said this may be due to them being more interested in their home town than their place of study.Takyiwa Danso, 23, from London, said: ""You're kind of like a nomad, you don't really see yourself in one place. You probably care about where you're actually from.""Work to try to get more young people to vote in the council elections on 5 May has included writing to tenants of halls of residence to remind them.The Electoral Commission says students are difficult to keep track of on the electoral register because they might be on it at their parents' home, but not at their term time address. It also found similar difficulties among young private renters. MPs and English councillors are elected by the ""first past the post"" system. The candidate with the most votes wins.Katie Ghose, chief executive of The Electoral Reform Society, says countries with proportional representation typically have higher turnouts ""as people feel their votes actually count"".It suggests moving to proportional representation, such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in local government elections in Northern Ireland and Scotland. STV involves ranking candidates in order of preference.On its website, the society also lists the disadvantages of STV, saying the count takes longer, can lead to larger constituencies and result in people voting for the candidates ""in the order they appear on the ballot"".In 2011 a referendum on changing the voting system for MPs to the ""alternative vote"" saw 68% of voters say no. Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned against it, said at the time: ""It can mean someone who's not really wanted by anyone winning an election because they were the least unliked.""Elections for police and crime commissioners use the ""supplementary vote"" system if there are more than two candidates. Voters choose a first and second preference.However, when the positions were first elected in 2012, national turnout was a record low at fewer than 15%. Lack of awareness about the elections was the most common reason given.When Survation asked 2,096 non-voters what would persuade them to cast a ballot, the most popular answer - at 39% was  ""other"".Mr Lyons Lowe said: ""Our major study of non-voters revealed that in most cases, non-voters have the same concerns about political issues that voters have - creating a stable economy, promoting jobs, reducing poverty, reforming welfare and protecting the NHS. ""The key difference between voters and non-voters is that the latter are not making the connection between these issues in principle and the political and electoral system in practice.""Only 19% of non-voters gave 'no interest in politics' as their main reason for not voting, compared with 42% who said either parties and candidates are all the same or what they believe isn't represented by the parties or candidates. ""When asked what might make them more likely to cast a vote, many respondents wanted more information about the parties and candidates, but a significant minority wrote verbatim comments within the research that they wanted better candidates to vote for, or else that there simply was nothing that would persuade them to vote."""

After the ""Stair Wars"" in which a Labour MP waged running verbal combat with Ken Livingstone, and ignited questions about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the warring factions have suddenly fallen all but silent. Peace, though, has not broken out. Anything but.It's a momentary ceasefire. On both sides, people are keeping their heads down - judging it too dangerous to speak up.Today, Jeremy Corbyn cancelled his campaigning trip to Wales to avoid unwanted media attention. Media attention is supposed to be the point! The First Minister of Wales, Carwen Jones, admitted Mr Corbyn isn't a hit with everyone on the doorsteps. ""Yes there are some people saying to me I'm unsure about Jeremy Corbyn. There are others who take the opposite view. What we are finding is that fewer and fewer people are mentioning him on the doorstep.""Mr Corbyn's critics - and enemies - are also keeping quiet. In private their mood is ferocious. They want Ken Livingstone expelled, and Mr Corbyn to take anti-Semitism in the party more seriously. So why the phoney peace? Behind the scenes, fear is spreading of what some expect to be poor results for Labour in Thursday's elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities. ""Outside London, it's looking dire,"" one told me.  And now, Mr Corbyn's enemies - who are under constant watch by the leaders' allies - are anxious to avoid being blamed for making things worse by showing disloyalty to their embattled leader. They expect those accusations to be levelled anyway. There's mutual suspicion and hostility bordering on hatred between the rival wings and factions of the Labour Party. It's been a messy, chaotic few days. Acrimonious in public, worse in private. Some action is coming on Labour's approach to racism and anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn will speak out. Rule changes explicitly declaring zero tolerance of racism look likely. But there are fears a good deal of damage has already been done, and the Labour Party will pay a price at the polls. The election results, when they come, will inevitably be subjected to rival, probably diametrically opposing interpretations within the Labour Party. But from all I'm hearing from sources in the opposing camps, anything that can be read as a  poor night in Thursday's elections will escalate the in-fighting to a new pitch. A fierce confrontation over Labour's future direction and leadership now looks unavoidable."

The UK's exports of goods and services to the Commonwealth in 2014 were worth £47.8bn. The comparable figure for the EU was £228.9bn. It's worth noting that the UK does plenty of business with countries that are part of neither group - for example, we sell twice as much to the USA as we do to our biggest EU partner, Germany.On Friday's Today Programme, former Prime Minister Sir John Major said that the UK exports five times as much to the European Union as it does to the 52 countries of the Commonwealth.Is he right?Figures from the Office for National Statistics show our exports of goods and services to the Commonwealth in 2014 were worth £47.8bn.The comparable figure for the EU that year was £228.9bn, which is slightly less than five times the Commonwealth figure.So the figure the former prime minister used is accurate. But why did he choose this one? We have historical links with the Commonwealth, but our biggest customer in the Commonwealth is only our thirteenth biggest in the world.There are 52 other countries in the Commonwealth. We know from the ONS Pink Book (table 9.3) which are our biggest customers in the Commonwealth. The top five are India, Australia, Canada, Singapore and South Africa.But some of the Commonwealth countries are very small, including Nauru and Tuvalu, both of which have populations of about 10,000.What other figures could he have used? In 2014 we exported £88bn of goods and services to our biggest single customer, the USA, which was twice as much as our second biggest customer, Germany.We sell more than half of our exports to seven countries, four of which are EU members.Source: ONS Pink Book. Note: The figure for the Netherlands may be enlarged by the so-called Rotterdam Effect, in which goods being shipped from its ports are counted as exports to the Netherlands.

2016-05-02,Ken Livingstone profile,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181450/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-17539320,"Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended by the Labour Party over comments he made while defending an MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row, has a had long and often controversial political career. Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name - another being his nemesis, and Conservative successor as mayor, Boris Johnson.Like Mr Johnson, he cultivated a quirky public image, with his pet newts and appearances on chat shows. He even lent his nasal tones to a track on a best-selling Blur album.His way with a provocative soundbite was the making of him, propelling him to national prominence from the grey world of local government, but it has also got him into a lot of hot water over the years. Not for nothing is his autobiography called You Can't Say That.He was suspended from office as mayor for four weeks in 2006 for comparing a Jewish journalist to a concentration camp guard - a comment he continues to be unrepentant about, saying it was a ""fuss about nothing"". The suspension was overturned in court.He has also been repeatedly criticised for his decision to welcome controversial Muslim cleric Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who condoned suicide bombings, to London in 2005. He said it was part of an effort to improve relations with the Muslim world.He remains popular in left-wing circles as one of the few genuine socialists to have achieved real power in the UK - but he had largely disappeared from the political scene, following his defeat in 2012 mayoral contest, although he continued to be elected to Labour's ruling national executive committee.He was enjoying semi-retirement when his old friend and ally Jeremy Corbyn was unexpectedly elected Labour leader last year.The two go back a long way - they share the same political outlook and commitment to causes such as nuclear disarmament and Palestinian solidarity - and Mr Corbyn worked hard to get him to the top at the Greater London Council in the early 1980s.Age: 70Marital status: Married his long-term partner in 2009. Two children with current partner and three other children. Political party: LabourTime served as Mayor: Two terms from 2000-2008Previous jobs: MP for Brent East 1987-2001; leader GLC 1981-1986; London councillor; lab technician; journalist and broadcasterMr Corbyn drafted in advisers from Mr Livingstone's time in City Hall when he took on Labour's top job and Mr Livingstone himself became part of his inner circle.Before long, the former London mayor was back on the airwaves as Mr Corbyn's chief defender, in the face of attacks from Blairite opponents.He was also given a role on the party's defence review - but controversy, almost inevitably, followed.He faced a barrage of criticism from Labour MPs - including Mr Corbyn himself - for suggesting Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister who had suffered from depression, needed ""psychiatric help"" for suggesting he knew nothing about defence.An apology eventually came but Mr Livingstone was soon in trouble again, over comments on BBC One's Question Time about how the 7/7 London bombers ""gave their lives"" to protest against the Iraq war.He then came under fire from Labour colleagues for describing a donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis from a hedge fund as like ""Jimmy Savile funding a children's group"".It later emerged Mr Livingstone himself had accepted £8,000 from a hedge fund, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.Born in Streatham, south London in 1945, Kenneth Robert Livingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive before taking up a job as a lab technician working on cancer research in the Royal Marsden Hospital. In 1971 he was elected to Lambeth Borough Council and that was the start of a long career in politics. Over the next 10 years he served as a local councillor and then on Greater London council before becoming the leader of the GLC in 1981.After the GLC was abolished he crossed the River Thames to Westminster, winning the seat of Brent East in 1987. He had a child at the age of 57 with his long-term partner and later wife Emma Beal. At the time it was thought to be his first child but in 2008 it emerged that he already had three other children with another two women. Beal and Livingstone went on to have a second child in 2004. He always had a difficult relationship with his own party. Frequently critical of Neil Kinnock, his battle with the party leadership did not diminish under Tony Blair. In the run-up to the mayoral election of 2000 he failed to secure the Labour candidacy, losing out to the leadership favourite, Frank Dobson. Mr Livingstone declared that he would stand as an independent candidate, and so Labour expelled him from the party. Standing as an independent far from scuppered him, and he won with 58% of the vote. In 2000, Tony Blair had been critical of his prospects in office claiming he would be a ""disaster"". However Mr Blair had to eat his words when Livingstone was admitted back into the party ahead of the 2004 mayoral election which saw him re-elected. ""I think I should be big enough to say the prediction I made has not turned out right,"" Mr Blair said at the time. Mr Livingstone's flagship mayoral policy was the introduction of the controversial congestion charge in central London, later extended to west London. He unsuccessfully fought the Labour government as it introduced a public-private partnership plan for the London Underground.He was also involved with London's successful bid for the Olympic Games and in dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attack of 2005. Even his opponent Boris Johnson praised him for speaking up for London after 7/7 and the failed attack several weeks later.Mr Livingstone boasts achievements such as the introduction of the Oyster card for London transport, free use of public transport for under-18s in full-time education and a revival and increased usage of London buses. He also claims to have increased numbers of police on London's streets to a record level. He faced attack for his links with the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, signing an oil deal with him in 2007 and when he lost the mayoral election in 2008 taking up a position as a consultant to Chavez, advising on urban planning. Ken Livingstone has always divided opinion. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was the former GLC boss who invented the ""loony left"" and who brought about the council's abolition by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was ""ahead of his time"". The Sun newspaper once described him as ""the most odious man in Britain"".But he is still popular with many on the left of the Labour Party, who relished his role as a thorn in Lady Thatcher's side and for speaking his mind about his socialist beliefs, when all about him in the party were abandoning theirs.It is, perhaps, ironic that just as the Labour Party has started to come back to his way of thinking, he faces being excluded from it."

Any issues of misconduct will be taken very seriously.""Sir Philip bought BHS in 2000 for £200m, but sold the department store last year. BHS was 'crashed into a cliff''What we'll miss if BHS closes'Broken promises at BHS?The demise of BHS on the High StreetAt the time, there were questions over the lack of retail experience of Dominic Chappell and his team at Retail Acquisitions, which became the majority shareholder of the department store.A fortnight ago, the business fell into administration with debts of £1.3bn - including a pension deficit of £571m - putting 11,000 jobs at risk across 164 stores nationwide.Sir Philip is believed to have offered to provide about £80m to help plug the pension deficit. But he has already faced accusations that he crashed BHS ""into a cliff"", from the chairman of the Business Innovation and Skills Committee, Iain Wright.Meanwhile, Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said Sir Philip had contacted Parliament and ""indicated his willingness to come to Parliament to give oral evidence"" to a joint session of the Work and Pensions select committee and the Business, Innovation and Skills committee.No date had yet been set for his appearance. There were suggestions that the committees also wanted to quiz Sir Philip's wife, Lady Green. But Mr Field said he believed Sir Philip ""will be able to answer all of our questions on the operations of BHS's pension fund"". Ahead of Sir Philip's appearance, the Work and Pensions Committee is due to hear from the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, BHS Pension Trustees, and Mr Chappell.There is no suggestion that Sir Philip did anything illegal.However, on Friday, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer, Lord Myners, told the BBC Sir Philip had big questions to answer over his stewardship of BHS.Lord Myners said: ""The big question is whether when Philip Green sold BHS to a group of individuals with no retail experience, led by a former mini racing car driver and twice bankrupt person... that the pension scheme had enough assets to meet its liabilities.""He added: ""It is the responsibility of the owner to either make sure that the pension fund is adequately funded or that the new owner is going to take on that responsibility and is a fit and proper person with adequate funding and sensible plans to ensure that the deficit will be covered."""

2016-05-03,Universal Credit 'veering off track',https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36187916,"The government's flagship benefit reform has ""serious design flaws"" and has ""veered off track"" because of cost-cutting, a think tank has warned.The Resolution Foundation said Universal Credit could leave 2.5 million families worse off, some by more than £3,000 a year.It comes as the government announces a further expansion of the scheme.Welfare Secretary Stephen Crabb said the payment was ""transforming welfare"" and getting people into work faster.Universal Credit, championed by Mr Crabb's predecessor Iain Duncan Smith, aims to provide incentives for people to move off benefits and into work.Universal Credit replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance with a single payment.After delays hit the original timetable, it is being gradually rolled out across the country and is now available to new single jobseekers in every job centre across the UK.The latest target for a full roll-out is 2021.The Resolution Foundation, chaired by former Conservative minister David Willetts, said it had long supported Universal Credit, which it said would simplify welfare and boost work incentives.However, it said recent changes, ""which have been driven by the government's desire to secure further savings in the welfare budget... have taken it too far from its original purpose"".Unless design flaws are eradicated, it said, Universal Credit ""risks being reduced to little more than a very complicated vehicle for cutting the benefits bill"".It urged Mr Crabb to ""reclaim"" the reform from the Treasury.The report said while some of the current system's ""disincentives"" to return to work had been removed by the reform, the opposite was true for many families, particularly ""second earners"" in couples.While it predicted 2.5 million would be worse off, it said almost two million would fare better under the new regime.David Finch, the think tank's senior economic analyst, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while the benefit provided financial incentives to work, the incentives for people to increase their earnings were ""particularly weak"". He said people kept about 35p from each pound they earn and benefits were withdrawn when people started to work as little as five or 10 hours a week. Mr Finch added: ""There's a risk that people, particularly single parents, get trapped at quite low levels of pay and fail to progress. ""So while there may be an incentive for them to get into work, that incentive for them then to boost their earnings and progress in work is weak.""Mr Duncan Smith resigned as work and pensions secretary in March this year, citing pressure to ""salami-slice"" welfare.In his resignation letter, he said: ""There had been too much emphasis on money saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.""The government said more than 450,000 people had made a claim for Universal Credit so far, with more than 9,500 new claims made every week.Mr Crabb told the Today programme there had been changes to the scheme since it was launched in 2010, but said measures such as an increased tax allowance and the National Living Wage had ""transformed the landscape"" and would ""override"" the losses outlined by the Resolution Foundation.Mr Crabb said the latest expansion marked an ""important milestone"".He added: ""Universal Credit is transforming welfare and is central to our vision for our society where people of all backgrounds can earn a decent wage and provide for their families, with claimants moving into work faster and earning more than under the old system.""Our focus now is on continuing its expansion to all claimants.""Labour's shadow welfare secretary Owen Smith said cuts to Universal Credit had ""fatally undermined"" incentives to work.""The Tories should stop slapping themselves on the back for delivering cuts to working families right across the country and instead listen to Labour's calls for an urgent U-turn."""

2016-05-03,Farage: UKIP to win five seats in Wales,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36195492,"UKIP will win at least five seats on the Welsh Assembly as part of a UK-wide ""breakthrough"" in Thursday's polls, its leader Nigel Farage has said.He said his party was on course to win its first ever seats in Cardiff - where it is campaigning heavily - and in the Northern Ireland and London Assemblies.It was ""50-50"" whether the party would gain representation in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, he said.He declined to put a target on UKIP gains in English council elections.UKIP is campaigning on multiple fronts as it seeks to become the only UK party to get people elected to the National Assembly of Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as the Greater London Assembly.The party has focused much of its time and resources in Wales, where it won 13% of the vote in last year's general election.Opinion polls suggest UKIP is set to win seats for the first time despite a row over its candidate selection process.Mr Farage told the BBC's Daily Politics: ""There will be a breakthrough in Wales. I think we are going to win five seats - we may do slightly better than that. Let's see.""As for England, Mr Farage would not be drawn on how many seats it would gain but said its record in local government was a good one and he predicted it would consolidate its position in its existing strongholds in Essex and South Yorkshire.""We will make gains. To try and guess how many is virtually impossible. In Thurrock, I think we will become the biggest party on that council, in Rotherham we have a chance of becoming the biggest party on that council.""There are 500 local UKIP councillors. Our local base is growing, the people who have had elected have behaved, on the whole, pretty well and been very diligent and worked very hard. Yes, we will improve.""There has been speculation about the future of the party, and a possible change in direction, whatever the outcome of June's referendum on EU membership. Mr Farage said if there was a narrow vote to stay in the EU, a lot of Conservative and Labour supporters would be unable to reconcile themselves with the result and their party leadership's stance and UKIP could find itself ""a lot bigger than it is now"".If there was a vote to leave, he said UKIP would need to ""stay around"" to ensure that the people's will was ""implemented"" but he conceded that it would need to show it could talk about issues other than Europe. And he rejected suggestions that UKIP - which only managed to get one MP elected in last year's general election despite winning 12% of the vote - was treading water nationally, citing a recent YouGov opinion poll which put it on 20%. ""We are now at the highest we have ever been as a party - what more can I do?"""

While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started a trading company that has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals with other companies for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.A management buyout team, under the name of Excalibur Steel UK, has also confirmed it has registered a letter of intent with Tata expressing its formal interest in its UK steel assets. It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the previous head of Tata's UK strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs on the board.Mr Wilkie, chief executive of Excalibur, said in a statement: ""It was only two weeks ago we made the decision to pursue a buy-out that enables the management and staff to take a stake in the ownership and operation of a strategic British industry. ""We believe we have a large number of the pieces in place required to make this a success, including a management team with vast experience of steelmaking and processing.""The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1."
2016-05-03,Campaign focus on jobs and education,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-scotland-36191692,"Jobs and education were the focus of the penultimate day of campaigning for the Holyrood election.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon addressed Aberdeen business leaders on how her party plans to create more jobs.Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale warned about cuts to education, as did will Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie during a visit to Renfrew.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson travelled from Oban to Peterhead to canvass for votes.And Patrick Harvie and Maggie Chapman of the Scottish Greens visited Fife College where they highlighted the potential for new jobs in renewable industries.What is in the manifestos?Scotland's political parties have now published their manifestos ahead of the Holyrood election on 5 May. So, what are they pledging?Ahead of campaigning on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said that job creation would be at the heart of a re-elected SNP government's agenda.She added: ""As we have shown in recent months, we will relentlessly champion Scottish business and always stand up for our key industries.""And the only way people in Scotland can be sure of re-electing an SNP government with a bold, ambitious plan to create new and better-paid jobs is to cast both votes for the SNP on Thursday.""Voters go to the polls on Thursday to elect their new constituency and regional list MSPs.Ms Dugdale visited a soft play area in Glasgow where she is expected to warn of the threat ""the SNP's £3bn of cuts"" could have on education and frontline services.She said: ""The SNP must now come clean on their secret cuts by telling voters where the axe would fall.""A vote for Labour is a vote to use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to tax the richest 1% so we can invest in schools and stop the cuts to public services. A vote for the SNP is a vote for cuts to children's education, cuts to frontline services and cutting jobs.""The Scottish Conservatives hired a helicopter to take Ms Davidson from coast to coast where she will try to convince voters that she is the one opposition leader who can challenge the SNP.She said: ""Many people are supporting me because they just want an opposition at Holyrood which will really hold the SNP to account for once. Labour has had its chance - I am ready to step up and do a job for Scotland.""Mr Rennie insisted that the SNP had had nine years to ""get to grips"" with the challenges facing public services.He added: ""Everywhere I go, people tell me that they are pleased that we are talking about big issues like education and mental health that were neglected while the SNP campaigned for independence. ""The last thing Scotland needs is a groundhog day debate on the constitution.""With just two full days of campaigning to go, the Scottish Greens were keen to underline their manifesto commitment to ""invest in skills and new jobs"".The party's co-convener Mr Harvie said: ""Scotland's economy is facing huge challenges, not least from the inevitable decline in the oil and gas sectors, so the need for a plan of action has never been greater.""Today's visit [to Fife College] underlines the Scottish Green Party's manifesto commitment to investment in skills and new jobs that will last."""
2016-05-03,"Welsh NHS 'verging on crisis', say Tories",https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36186034,"Opposition parties have attacked Labour's record on health ahead of Thursday's assembly elections.The leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said public services were ""verging on crisis"".First Minister Carwyn Jones said the NHS was ""on the ballot paper"" at the election, but has defended his handling of the service despite criticism over waiting times.Labour currently holds 30 seats in the 60-member assembly.The Conservatives have 14, Plaid Cymru 11 and the Liberal Democrats five.Mr Davies is beginning a tour of Wales on Tuesday, and said: ""Wales is in desperate need of a change and communities are crying out for a new approach. ""The economy needs to be reinvigorated, and our public services are verging on crisis - a crisis of Carwyn Jones' making.""Speaking in Wrexham on Monday, Mr Jones repeated his suggestion that the NHS was ""on the ballot paper"" on Thursday.He said: ""We know the health service has faced some challenges, in north Wales in particular. ""The last five years of Tory austerity have been difficult ones and the demand for healthcare is rising all the time. ""But, we have an NHS in Wales - and an NHS workforce - of which we can be proud.""There had been ""real improvements"" since 2011, he said, including a larger medical workforce and improved cancer survival rates.Plaid Cymru are focusing on a pledge to scrap care charges for the elderly and dementia sufferers.  The party wants to scrap both fees over a 10-year period, at a cost of £226m.Plaid's Elin Jones said: ""Our plans will save people up to £30,000 every year. It is a significant commitment, but it is a commitment that we believe is important to make.""Plaid Cymru will restore the values of the NHS, making care free at the point of need for everyone who needs it. ""This is about keeping the social contract with people who have worked all through their lives, have paid their taxes and who now need care.""Kirsty Williams, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""People don't expect miracles from our NHS, but they do expect staff to have the time to treat patients with the dignity they deserve. ""17 years of Labour has meant nurses in Wales have more patients each to care for than in any other part of the UK. That must change - a vote for the Welsh Liberal Democrats is a vote for dignified care.""The party is pledging to ensure a minimum number of nurses on mental health and  maternity wards. A private members' bill introduced by Ms Williams in the last assembly has already seen the policy adopted on general wards.UKIP, who are aiming to win their first seats in the Senedd, are due to be joined on the campaign by party leader Nigel Farage in Newport."
2016-05-03,‘Democracy deficit’ in low turnout wards,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35999707,"Fewer than one in five eligible voters in some parts of England previously chose anyone to represent them in local elections, raising fears of a democratic deficit.BBC News analysis of voting patterns in 2,500 council wards since 2012 shows wide disparities.Most of the areas where the fewest people voted in recent elections are in the North.The Electoral Reform Society said it was vital people turned out to vote.Campaigners are concerned there will be a low turnout again on Thursday 5 May if voters continue to see local authority elections as ""less important"" than a General Election.According to data from the commission covering the 2012, 2014 and 2015 council elections:Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area.41wards saw fewer than 20% of the electorate vote in 2012368,594 were eligible to vote 65,221 returned a ballot that year 4 wards had under 1/5 turnout in 2014, alongside European elections 43% was lowest turnout in 2015, when General Election took place too Get the data here.Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ""These figures show that there is a serious democratic deficit in local elections in England. ""Local authorities are central to running so many services - from adult social care, to waste, schools and transport -  and with many getting more powers, it's vital people turn out, hold them to account and have their say.""A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: ""Our research shows that recent home movers, young people, people from some black and minority ethnic communities, and people in rented accommodation are less likely to be registered to vote.""The commission ran a public awareness campaign encouraging people from these groups to go online and register, with more than 1.6 million applications made since 1 February.Despite the North having some of the least engaged voters, it also contained those at the top end.The ward with the best turnout overall was Old Laund Booth in Pendle, Lancashire, where 85% of registered voters used their ballot in 2015. However, the ward has only one councillor and therefore elections only take place every four years.Of those wards that held elections three years out of four, it was Bastwell in Blackburn that had the highest average turnout, 66%.Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, said the Bastwell turnout was encouraging and showed trends such as those seen in Liverpool Central could be reversed.He said: ""When we were in Liverpool there was real, entrenched cynicism among too many individuals. They believe that these civic institutions barely look like the people they are representing and they say it has nothing to do with them, which then makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy as they do not use their vote to change it.""Bastwell shows things can be turned around and offers us hope. But it has to be bottom up, diverse-led change. Change cannot be from community leaders herding people blindly into the polling booths.""A Liverpool City Council spokesman said the Central ward had a ""very large student population"", which suggested ""a lot of voter apathy among them for local elections"".It worked with the National Union of Students, visiting halls of residence and hired campaign group Operation Black Vote's bus to encourage people to register before the deadline on 18 April.In the 2012 council elections the national average turnout was 31%. Two years later, when the vote coincided with the European Parliament elections, it was 36%.And when the vote coincided with the General Election in 2015, average turnout rose to 65%. The lowest turnout in the country last year was Chalvey ward in Slough, where just under 43% voted.66%Average turnout over 3 elections75% Asian/Asian British residents Bottom 14% for deprivation Bottom 12% for employment Bottom 7% for education Ingrid Koehler, senior policy researcher at think tank the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU), said: ""It's disappointing, but not surprising, that some wards across the country appear disengaged based on voter turnout. It's important to remember that many people, including those who don't vote, have regular interactions with local government - far more so than with central government. ""Still, there are many systemic reasons why turnout in local elections is low. For too long, local government has been treated as the delivery arm of national government. As local devolution progresses, hopefully people will see more reason to make the effort to decide who represents them locally."""
2016-05-03,Welsh Labour appeal for 'left-wing' vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-wales-36182158,"Carwyn Jones has made a direct appeal to Plaid Cymru, Liberal Democrat and Green supporters to lend their votes to Labour.The Welsh Labour leader said left-leaning voters should side with his party to stop the Conservatives.With three days to go, other parties are attack Labour's record in office.Plaid said Labour had ""managed decline"" while the Lib Dems said Labour should be ""ashamed"" of its record on education.The Conservatives said Mr Jones' record on the NHS showed Labour were ""not up to the job"" of governing Wales.As the assembly election campaign enters its final week, Mr Jones used a speech in Wrexham - one of the Tories' target seats - to say Labour wanted to see an ""confident, open, outward looking Wales"".He repeatedly attacked ""the Tories, Plaid and UKIP"", but made no mention of the Liberal Democrats.  With polls suggesting that Labour will lose seats but remain the largest party, there has been some speculation that Mr Jones could seek to form a coalition with the Lib Dems after polling day.Mr Jones is keen to get his campaign back on track after Labour was rocked by claims of anti-Semitism last week.In Wrexham he said the outcome would be decided in Labour/Tory battleground seats such as the Vale of Clwyd and Gower.Opponents claim that under 17 years of Labour-led governments since devolution, standards in public services in Wales are not good enough.But Mr Jones returned to two main planks of his campaign: that Wales has avoided a junior doctors' strike and the impact of spending cuts imposed in Westminster.""So, if you're thinking about voting Liberal, or Plaid, or Green in the seats where it is a straight fight between Labour and Tory - think about that risk,"" he said.""Think about importing that kind of politics into the assembly. And lend us your vote in those constituencies to stop it.""Speaking on Sunday, Plaid leader Leanne Wood said: ""After seventeen years of managed decline in our public services, the people of Wales have a once in a generation opportunity to deliver real change for our nation.""Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said a generation of children had been ""left behind"" under Labour.She said: ""Ministers say they took their eye off the ball, casually accepting that a generation of young people have been let down due to Labour complacency. They should be ashamed.""Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Labour's management of the NHS proves they're not up to the job. ""The election this Thursday presents voters with their best opportunity in nearly two decades to deliver new leadership for Wales, and secure a strong, properly-funded NHS backed up by a strong economy. With Labour only one seat from losing power, a new start for our NHS is within reach.""The Welsh Conservatives are the only party to have made a manifesto commitment to safeguard the NHS budget and to increase spending on health services each and every year during the Assembly term."""
2016-05-03,Parents in primary school test protest,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36188634,"Numbers of parents have kept their children off school for the day in a protest about primary tests in England.More than 40,000 parents have signed a petition calling for a boycott of primary school tests, which are due to be taken later this month.Parents supporting the Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign have complained of a damaging culture of over-testing.Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says taking pupils out of school ""even for a day is harmful to their education"".It remains uncertain how many primary school children were kept off school across the country, but a social media campaign had urged parents to take children on educational activities for the day.About 500 people gathered at Preston Park in Brighton, including children's laureate Chris Riddell.""We should be turning children into readers with the pleasure that gives, rather than relying on a testing culture,"" said Mr Riddell.Parents have handed in the petition at the headquarters of the Department for Education in London. Among the parents present was Caterina, with son and daughter in Ivydale school in Nunhead, south London.She said the school was ""amazing and creative"" but there was now ""too much pressure"" on six and seven year olds.The campaign organisers say children are ""over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning"".They have raised concerns about the impact of primary tests, so-called Sats tests, taken by seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds, which are being made more stretching with changes to the curriculum.They have challenged what they claim is a ""dull, dry curriculum"" based around tests.In an open letter to the education secretary, campaigners have warned of schools becoming ""exam factories"" and that testing causes stress and can make young children feel like ""failures"".Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw rejected these arguments, saying that improving social mobility depended on making sure that children are not falling behind at any early age.""The government is right to introduce greater structure and rigour into the assessment process. Those who oppose this testing need to consider England's mediocre position in the OECD education rankings,"" said Sir Michael.""As I have long argued, children who fall behind in the early years of their education struggle to catch up in later years.""Education Minister Nick Gibb said tests improved standards and need not be stressful.""Schools should not be putting pressure on young people when taking these assessments.  ""I've been to many schools where the children don't even know they're taking the tests,"" said Mr Gibb. The importance of testing was emphasised by Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education.He said that any short-term stress was worth it if in the longer term it meant that children finished school with better results.Schools minister Nick Gibb was asked a question on BBC Radio 4's World at One from a grammar test for 11 year oldsMartha Kearney: Let me give you this sentence: ""I went to the cinema, after I'd eaten my dinner."" Is the word ""after"" there being used as a subordinating conjunction or a preposition?Nick Gibb: Well it's a preposition. Martha Kearney: I don't think it is.Nick Gibb: ""After"" is a preposition. It can be used in some contexts as a word that coordinates a sub-clause, but this isn't about me.Martha Kearney: But I think in this sentence it's being used as a subordinating conjunction.Nick Gibb: Fine, well this isn't about me, this is about ensuring that future generations of children - unlike me incidentally,  who was not taught grammar at primary school...Martha Kearney: Perhaps not.Nick Gibb: ...We need to make sure that future generations of children are taught grammar properly.""Mr McGovern said that tests in England's schools needed to be tougher to catch up with international competitors.""We're three years behind the Chinese at the age of 15. We are a bit of a basket case internationally.""We've got to do something, we've got to act early, and a health check at seven is a good idea.""Ministers have already had problems with the administration of primary school tests this year.The baseline tests, which were intended to be a benchmark for measuring progress, were found to have unreliable results and have been postponed.Tests for seven-year-olds in spelling, punctuation and grammar also had to be called off when it was found that test questions had mistakenly been published on a Department for Education website.Labour's shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said she did not ""condone children being taken out of school"".But she accused the government of ""creating chaos and confusion in primary assessment"".Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""I think the gap between the profession and the government has never been wider than it is at the moment.""He warned of ""an enormous number of mistakes, delays and confusions around testing"".But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has argued that raising standards will improve creativity and not restrict it.""How creative can a child be if they struggle to understand the words on the page in front of them?"" Mrs Morgan told head teachers at the weekend.""That is why the campaign led by some of those who do not think we should set high expectations, who want to keep their children home for a day is so damaging. ""Keeping children home, even for a day is harmful to their education."""
2016-05-03,Rich and poor lifespan gap 'widening',https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36170289,"The gap between the lifespans of rich and poor people in England and Wales is rising for the first time since the 1870s, researchers have suggested. Everyone is living longer but rich people's lives are extending faster, the City University London study says. Better life expectancy narrowed the gap in the early 20th Century but this trend reversed for men in the 1990s.Author Prof Les Mayhew from Cass Business School said the difference was mainly due to ""lifestyle choices"". Based on figures from the Human Mortality Database, researchers measured the differences in age between the youngest 10% of adult deaths and the oldest 5%. From 1870 to 1939 the gap steadily closed, the report said. ""Everyone benefited from improvements in clean drinking water, better housing, higher incomes and better health,"" said Prof Mayhew. After 1950 there were further rises in life expectancy - though inequalities in lifespan persisted rather than narrowing further. But in the 1990s lifespan inequalities actually worsened, particularly for men, for the first time since the late 1870s, say the researchers. They found that for men who died in 2010 aged over 30:For women who died aged over 30 in 2010: Commenting on the data, Prof Mayhew said: ""This is partly due to some men now living to exceptionally old ages and in many cases equalling women - but at the other end of the distribution there has been a lack of progress."" The researchers attributed the widening disparity to poor lifestyle choices.""Many of the big gains from public health improvements are in the past and personal choices are now much more important,"" the report says.""Men in lower socio-economic groups are the most likely to make damaging lifestyle choices. ""They put themselves in harm's way on average more than women do - they smoke more, drink more and there are periods in their lives when they partake in riskier activities,"" say the authors. The authors suggest lack of wealth is not directly responsible for the difference, but the poorest groups are more likely to suffer the cumulative effects of decades of poor lifestyle choices and income inequality - while wealthier, more educated people may find it easier to adopt healthier habits. The authors say the negative health outcomes of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet and lack of exercise ""are disproportionately associated with the poorest in society"". They say it is vital to encourage healthier lifestyles and to counter pressure on individuals from ""exposure to advertising, their communities and peer groups"". Baroness Sally Greengross, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre, said the figures were ""particularly worrying"".""Preventing inequalities in ill health and disability must be a priority for policy action,"" she said.A Department of Health spokeswoman said everybody should have the opportunity to have a long and healthy life.""The number of workless households is at a record low and we know that economic security can provide the foundation for better physical and mental health.""We have shown that we are willing to take tough action to protect the public's health."""
2016-05-03,A guide to 2016's elections,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35813119,"Britain goes to the polls in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years. They are quite separate from the EU referendum, which is due to take place on 23 June.Here is a rundown of the elections taking place on 5 May:Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area.Polls close at 22:00. After that, counting begins, with the results coming in at different points over the next 24 hours.Watch: Which seats are up for grabs?In London, counting the votes will begin the day after polling day, with the new mayor expected to be announced from mid afternoon. Votes cast for the London Assembly will also be counted on Friday.Declarations in Scotland and Wales are expected overnight on Thursday, and during Friday in Northern Ireland.Where to watch the results on the BBCAn election special, presented by Huw Edwards, starts at 23:45 on BBC One, after Question Time, with coverage throughout the night as results come in. On BBC Radio 5 Live, Jim Naughtie and Anna Foster present an election special from 00:30.All the latest developments are on the BBC politics website, with rolling updates on the Election Live page.Until polls close, we are limited in what we report.There are also dedicated programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Anyone 18 or over on 5 May who is a British citizen living in the UK, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, or an EU citizen living in the UK, can vote in the English, Welsh, London or Northern Irish contests.  In Scotland, 16 and 17-year-olds are also eligible to vote.If you have received a polling card through the post then you are registered to vote. If not, you may need to check with your local authority that you are still on the electoral register, particularly if you have moved house recently. The deadline to register was Monday, 18 April.Most people vote in person at a polling station on the day. It is normally a local school or community centre - the location will be on your polling card. You do not need to take the polling card with you in order to vote.

Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up. SNP - 69 seatsLabour - 37Conservative - 15Lib Dems - 5Greens - 2What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.WalesWhat happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.Labour - 30 seatsConservative - 14Plaid Cymru - 11Lib Dem - 5What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game. What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.DUP - 38 seatsSinn Fein - 29UUP - 16SDLP - 14Alliance - 8Others - 3What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.Assembly seats after 2012 electionLabour - 12 seatsConservative - 9Green - 2 Lib Dem - 2 What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives.  The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance. The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 ""omnishambles"" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England. All seats are up for grabs in three councils: Sheffield, Knowsley and RotherhamMetropolitan boroughs: A third of council seats are up for election in 32 of 36 Metropolitan boroughs including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sunderland.

If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The by-election was triggered by the decision of Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly. Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May. What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.To find out more about these elections you can visit the Electoral Commission's About My Vote website."

2016-05-03,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-03,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-03,Welsh election,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-36185480,"Virtually everyone I speak to who has been involved in the Welsh assembly election admits it has been difficult to get a handle on.The uncertainty facing thousands of Welsh jobs in the steel industry has become a dominant theme.And the profile given to the EU referendum has made it difficult for the parties to cut through.As a result, there are fears of a lower turnout than five years ago, when just 42% of people voted.The opposition parties wanted a campaign dominated by scrutiny of Labour's 17 years in power since the start of devolution.Instead, it has lacked continuity.Labour has based its campaign on the personality of its leader, Carwyn Jones, by asking voters who they think would make the best first minister.One of the big challenges the party faces is appearing fresh after so many years in government in Cardiff.The Conservatives, who have been the main opposition, are focusing on problems in health, as well as offering significant tax breaks when partial control of income tax is devolved.They have had to overcome divisions over Europe to try to keep the momentum they generated in Wales as a result of some eye-catching victories in the general election last year.Plaid Cymru has set out plans for a major restructuring of public services, including the NHS, in an attempt to integrate health and social care.The party needs to develop some kind of momentum after a number of recent disappointing election results despite the high profile given to its leader, Leanne Wood.The Liberal Democrats have run a campaign stripped down to a small number of pledges, including more nurses and smaller class sizes.The party's obvious challenge is convincing people it can bounce back from the devastating result in the general election.And UKIP, who could have a significant presence at the assembly for the first time, has published a detailed manifesto on devolved services such as health and education in an attempt to show it is serious about the assembly, and not just about  Europe.Welsh Labour manifestoWelsh Conservative manifestoPlaid Cymru manifestoWelsh Liberal Democrats manifestoUKIP Wales manifestoThe big question mark is whether its supporters, who are clearly motivated by the EU referendum, can be enthused enough to turn out for the assembly election on 5 May.Labour has half of the 60 seats at the assembly. Polls over the past 18 months have suggested it is running about 10 percentage points down, which will make it vulnerable in a number of marginal seats held by the Tories at a parliamentary level.The indications are Labour will continue to be the largest party, the question is whether it will have enough assembly members to govern alone or have to form a coalition with another party.The impact of UKIP in marginal seats has introduced a new degree of unpredictability, while the prospect of a low turnout means the outcome could be decided by relatively low margins.Unlike in Scotland, where the SNP appears to be on track for an overall majority, the picture in Wales is far more uncertain.Wales Green PartyAbolish the Welsh Assembly PartyMonster Raving Loony PartyTrade Unionist and Socialist CoalitionWelsh Communist PartyFor full listings of all candidates standing in Wales, use our Constituency and Region pages."
2016-05-03,Election turn-off,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-36047612,"Fewer than 20% of people have chosen to vote in council elections in some areas of England over the past four years, BBC News analysis of voting patterns has shown. Why are people turning their back on local elections and how can they be drawn back to the ballot box?There were 41 out of about 2,500 wards in England where not even a fifth of the electorate turned out to choose a local councillor in 2012. This was the last time the seats being contested on 5 May this year were elected.The Electoral Reform Society said this amounted to ""serious democratic deficit"" and it is vital people vote and hold authorities to account.So how does the country solve a problem like low turnout? BBC News looks at some of the options.Online voting would improve turn out, according to market research conducted among 2,000 non-voters before the 2015 General Election.""We found two thirds of those who did not vote in 2010 said online voting would make them 'more likely' to vote,"" said Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of the research company Survation.""Improving access in this way might be particularly important for the 9% of non-voters who said they were 'not able to access a polling station or get a postal ballot'.""A commission set up by the Commons Speaker John Bercow said that by 2020 ""secure online voting should be an option for all voters"".Electronic voting is used in Estonia, where about 30% of participants cast their ballot online. So-called e-voting in the country has grown in popularity, from 30,275 users in the 2007 parliament elections to 176,491 people in 2015, while overall turnout has risen from 61.9% to 64.2%.However, the Estonian government says research suggests it did not play a great role in getting more people to vote.Arne Koitmäe, an adviser in the elections department of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu, said: ""[Researchers] found that while the aggregate turnout did increase marginally, they cannot really claim that this was only down to e-voting as such. ""Their conclusion was that e-voting simply makes voting easier but it doesn't address the underlining causes of turnout decline and it will not necessarily engage those for whom the problem lies in politics as such.""In Australia, non-voters face fines of $20 (about £11), rising to $170 (about £93) plus costs if they fail to pay.  In the 2013 General Election, turnout was more than 93%, compared with 66.1% in the UK in 2015. However, Australian voters spoiled 5.9% of ballot papers, while the UK electorate spoiled just 0.2%.Labour MP David Winnick tried to make voting a ""civic obligation"" in the UK via a Private Member's Bill, but it never made it beyond the Commons.But the Civitas think tank is concerned it might turn voting into ""one more thing that the state requires us to do, like filling in a tax form or taking the car for its MOT"".93%Turnout in Australia$20Fine for not voting1924 was when Australia introduced the legal duty to vote 14 countries enforce participation 17 countries say voting is compulsory but it is not enforced And Dr Annabelle Lever, a former fellow at the London School of Economics, has argued compulsory voting could see people without strong views coerced into voting a certain way by others.Writing in the journal Public Reason she said: ""Most protest, and all voting, depends for its success on the behaviour of other people, many of whom we will not know, many of whom will have interests and beliefs quite at odds with our own, and over whose behaviour we have no influence. ""People must, therefore, have rights to limit their participation in politics and, at the limit, to abstain.""The council ward with the lowest average turnout in 2012 was Liverpool Central, according to data from the Electoral Commission.The city council blames the low turnout on ""voter apathy"" for local elections among the large number of students registered in the ward. The ward saw a big rise in turnout in 2015 when the council elections coincided with the General Election.Ellie Hughes, who stood as a prospective councillor in Manchester in 2014 when she was an 18-year-old student, said she had tried to encourage friends to vote but ""a lot of people didn't even know there was a council election"".However, impartial campaign group Bite The Ballot, which encourages young people to vote, says that far from ""apathy"", many students feel councils do not want to consult with them.Campaigns manager Abiodun Michael Olatokun said: ""Young people are not apathetic. They do care deeply about the area they live in, about the standard of housing, the number of police officers and so on. Local democracy needs to be repurposed and made more accessible, with more online consultation and more use of social media.""Members of BBC Generation 2016, hand-picked to represent a broad cross-section of young people in the UK, agreed there was an issue with student engagement. They said this may be due to them being more interested in their home town than their place of study.Takyiwa Danso, 23, from London, said: ""You're kind of like a nomad, you don't really see yourself in one place. You probably care about where you're actually from.""Work to try to get more young people to vote in the council elections on 5 May has included writing to tenants of halls of residence to remind them.The Electoral Commission says students are difficult to keep track of on the electoral register because they might be on it at their parents' home, but not at their term time address. It also found similar difficulties among young private renters. MPs and English councillors are elected by the ""first past the post"" system. The candidate with the most votes wins.Katie Ghose, chief executive of The Electoral Reform Society, says countries with proportional representation typically have higher turnouts ""as people feel their votes actually count"".It suggests moving to proportional representation, such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in local government elections in Northern Ireland and Scotland. STV involves ranking candidates in order of preference.On its website, the society also lists the disadvantages of STV, saying the count takes longer, can lead to larger constituencies and result in people voting for the candidates ""in the order they appear on the ballot"".In 2011 a referendum on changing the voting system for MPs to the ""alternative vote"" saw 68% of voters say no. Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned against it, said at the time: ""It can mean someone who's not really wanted by anyone winning an election because they were the least unliked.""Elections for police and crime commissioners use the ""supplementary vote"" system if there are more than two candidates. Voters choose a first and second preference.However, when the positions were first elected in 2012, national turnout was a record low at fewer than 15%. Lack of awareness about the elections was the most common reason given.When Survation asked 2,096 non-voters what would persuade them to cast a ballot, the most popular answer - at 39% was  ""other"".Mr Lyons Lowe said: ""Our major study of non-voters revealed that in most cases, non-voters have the same concerns about political issues that voters have - creating a stable economy, promoting jobs, reducing poverty, reforming welfare and protecting the NHS. ""The key difference between voters and non-voters is that the latter are not making the connection between these issues in principle and the political and electoral system in practice.""Only 19% of non-voters gave 'no interest in politics' as their main reason for not voting, compared with 42% who said either parties and candidates are all the same or what they believe isn't represented by the parties or candidates. ""When asked what might make them more likely to cast a vote, many respondents wanted more information about the parties and candidates, but a significant minority wrote verbatim comments within the research that they wanted better candidates to vote for, or else that there simply was nothing that would persuade them to vote."""
2016-05-03,John Pienaar,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36172958,"After the shouting, screaming and recriminations of yesterday. After the ""Stair Wars"" in which a Labour MP waged running verbal combat with Ken Livingstone, and ignited questions about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the warring factions have suddenly fallen all but silent. Peace, though, has not broken out. Anything but.It's a momentary ceasefire. On both sides, people are keeping their heads down - judging it too dangerous to speak up.Today, Jeremy Corbyn cancelled his campaigning trip to Wales to avoid unwanted media attention. Media attention is supposed to be the point! The First Minister of Wales, Carwen Jones, admitted Mr Corbyn isn't a hit with everyone on the doorsteps. ""Yes there are some people saying to me I'm unsure about Jeremy Corbyn. There are others who take the opposite view. What we are finding is that fewer and fewer people are mentioning him on the doorstep.""Mr Corbyn's critics - and enemies - are also keeping quiet. In private their mood is ferocious. They want Ken Livingstone expelled, and Mr Corbyn to take anti-Semitism in the party more seriously. So why the phoney peace? Behind the scenes, fear is spreading of what some expect to be poor results for Labour in Thursday's elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities. ""Outside London, it's looking dire,"" one told me.  And now, Mr Corbyn's enemies - who are under constant watch by the leaders' allies - are anxious to avoid being blamed for making things worse by showing disloyalty to their embattled leader. They expect those accusations to be levelled anyway. There's mutual suspicion and hostility bordering on hatred between the rival wings and factions of the Labour Party. It's been a messy, chaotic few days. Acrimonious in public, worse in private. Some action is coming on Labour's approach to racism and anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn will speak out. Rule changes explicitly declaring zero tolerance of racism look likely. But there are fears a good deal of damage has already been done, and the Labour Party will pay a price at the polls. The election results, when they come, will inevitably be subjected to rival, probably diametrically opposing interpretations within the Labour Party. But from all I'm hearing from sources in the opposing camps, anything that can be read as a  poor night in Thursday's elections will escalate the in-fighting to a new pitch.

The UK's exports of goods and services to the Commonwealth in 2014 were worth £47.8bn. The comparable figure for the EU was £228.9bn. It's worth noting that the UK does plenty of business with countries that are part of neither group - for example, we sell twice as much to the USA as we do to our biggest EU partner, Germany.On Friday's Today Programme, former Prime Minister Sir John Major said that the UK exports five times as much to the European Union as it does to the 52 countries of the Commonwealth.Is he right?Figures from the Office for National Statistics show our exports of goods and services to the Commonwealth in 2014 were worth £47.8bn.The comparable figure for the EU that year was £228.9bn, which is slightly less than five times the Commonwealth figure.So the figure the former prime minister used is accurate. But why did he choose this one? We have historical links with the Commonwealth, but our biggest customer in the Commonwealth is only our thirteenth biggest in the world.There are 52 other countries in the Commonwealth. We know from the ONS Pink Book (table 9.3) which are our biggest customers in the Commonwealth. The top five are India, Australia, Canada, Singapore and South Africa.But some of the Commonwealth countries are very small, including Nauru and Tuvalu, both of which have populations of about 10,000.What other figures could he have used? In 2014 we exported £88bn of goods and services to our biggest single customer, the USA, which was twice as much as our second biggest customer, Germany.We sell more than half of our exports to seven countries, four of which are EU members.Source: ONS Pink Book. Note: The figure for the Netherlands may be enlarged by the so-called Rotterdam Effect, in which goods being shipped from its ports are counted as exports to the Netherlands.

2016-05-03,Ken Livingstone profile,https://web.archive.org//web/20160503181500/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-17539320,"Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended by the Labour Party over comments he made while defending an MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row, has a had long and often controversial political career. Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name - another being his nemesis, and Conservative successor as mayor, Boris Johnson.Like Mr Johnson, he cultivated a quirky public image, with his pet newts and appearances on chat shows. He even lent his nasal tones to a track on a best-selling Blur album.His way with a provocative soundbite was the making of him, propelling him to national prominence from the grey world of local government, but it has also got him into a lot of hot water over the years. Not for nothing is his autobiography called You Can't Say That.He was suspended from office as mayor for four weeks in 2006 for comparing a Jewish journalist to a concentration camp guard - a comment he continues to be unrepentant about, saying it was a ""fuss about nothing"". The suspension was overturned in court.He has also been repeatedly criticised for his decision to welcome controversial Muslim cleric Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who condoned suicide bombings, to London in 2005. He said it was part of an effort to improve relations with the Muslim world.He remains popular in left-wing circles as one of the few genuine socialists to have achieved real power in the UK - but he had largely disappeared from the political scene, following his defeat in 2012 mayoral contest, although he continued to be elected to Labour's ruling national executive committee.He was enjoying semi-retirement when his old friend and ally Jeremy Corbyn was unexpectedly elected Labour leader last year.The two go back a long way - they share the same political outlook and commitment to causes such as nuclear disarmament and Palestinian solidarity - and Mr Corbyn worked hard to get him to the top at the Greater London Council in the early 1980s.Age: 70Marital status: Married his long-term partner in 2009. Two children with current partner and three other children. Political party: LabourTime served as Mayor: Two terms from 2000-2008Previous jobs: MP for Brent East 1987-2001; leader GLC 1981-1986; London councillor; lab technician; journalist and broadcasterMr Corbyn drafted in advisers from Mr Livingstone's time in City Hall when he took on Labour's top job and Mr Livingstone himself became part of his inner circle.Before long, the former London mayor was back on the airwaves as Mr Corbyn's chief defender, in the face of attacks from Blairite opponents.He was also given a role on the party's defence review - but controversy, almost inevitably, followed.He faced a barrage of criticism from Labour MPs - including Mr Corbyn himself - for suggesting Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister who had suffered from depression, needed ""psychiatric help"" for suggesting he knew nothing about defence.An apology eventually came but Mr Livingstone was soon in trouble again, over comments on BBC One's Question Time about how the 7/7 London bombers ""gave their lives"" to protest against the Iraq war.He then came under fire from Labour colleagues for describing a donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis from a hedge fund as like ""Jimmy Savile funding a children's group"".It later emerged Mr Livingstone himself had accepted £8,000 from a hedge fund, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.Born in Streatham, south London in 1945, Kenneth Robert Livingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive before taking up a job as a lab technician working on cancer research in the Royal Marsden Hospital. In 1971 he was elected to Lambeth Borough Council and that was the start of a long career in politics. Over the next 10 years he served as a local councillor and then on Greater London council before becoming the leader of the GLC in 1981.After the GLC was abolished he crossed the River Thames to Westminster, winning the seat of Brent East in 1987. He had a child at the age of 57 with his long-term partner and later wife Emma Beal. At the time it was thought to be his first child but in 2008 it emerged that he already had three other children with another two women. Beal and Livingstone went on to have a second child in 2004. He always had a difficult relationship with his own party. Frequently critical of Neil Kinnock, his battle with the party leadership did not diminish under Tony Blair. In the run-up to the mayoral election of 2000 he failed to secure the Labour candidacy, losing out to the leadership favourite, Frank Dobson. Mr Livingstone declared that he would stand as an independent candidate, and so Labour expelled him from the party. Standing as an independent far from scuppered him, and he won with 58% of the vote. In 2000, Tony Blair had been critical of his prospects in office claiming he would be a ""disaster"". However Mr Blair had to eat his words when Livingstone was admitted back into the party ahead of the 2004 mayoral election which saw him re-elected. ""I think I should be big enough to say the prediction I made has not turned out right,"" Mr Blair said at the time. Mr Livingstone's flagship mayoral policy was the introduction of the controversial congestion charge in central London, later extended to west London. He unsuccessfully fought the Labour government as it introduced a public-private partnership plan for the London Underground.He was also involved with London's successful bid for the Olympic Games and in dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attack of 2005. Even his opponent Boris Johnson praised him for speaking up for London after 7/7 and the failed attack several weeks later.Mr Livingstone boasts achievements such as the introduction of the Oyster card for London transport, free use of public transport for under-18s in full-time education and a revival and increased usage of London buses. He also claims to have increased numbers of police on London's streets to a record level. He faced attack for his links with the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, signing an oil deal with him in 2007 and when he lost the mayoral election in 2008 taking up a position as a consultant to Chavez, advising on urban planning. Ken Livingstone has always divided opinion. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was the former GLC boss who invented the ""loony left"" and who brought about the council's abolition by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was ""ahead of his time"". The Sun newspaper once described him as ""the most odious man in Britain"".But he is still popular with many on the left of the Labour Party, who relished his role as a thorn in Lady Thatcher's side and for speaking his mind about his socialist beliefs, when all about him in the party were abandoning theirs.It is, perhaps, ironic that just as the Labour Party has started to come back to his way of thinking, he faces being excluded from it."

New mayors will be elected in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford, with UK parliamentary by-elections held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside.Police and crime commissioners are also being elected in England and Wales.How the BBC reports polling dayPolling stations across the length and breadth of the country will open at 07:00 BST, with voting allowed until 22:00 BST.Thursday's polls are the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020.Elections to the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh and the devolved assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast last took place in 2011. The SNP has been in power in Scotland since 2007, while Labour has run the Welsh government since 1999.There is a power-sharing arrangement in place in the Northern Ireland Executive.

In all national elections, the BBC is required by electoral law to adopt a code of practice, ensuring fairness between candidates.The basic principle behind due impartiality in political coverage is set out in the agreement accompanying the BBC Charter. This requires the BBC over time to ""give due weight and prominence to all the main strands of argument and to all the main parties"". So, on polling day specifically, the BBC (like other broadcasters, though they are covered by the Ofcom Code rather than a charter) doesn't report on any of the election campaigns from 00:30 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. Coverage on the day is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations or the weather.Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself, so the BBC's output cannot be seen to be influencing the ballot while the polls are open. No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed.Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election."
2016-05-04,Bid to break junior doctors deadlock,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36209321,"A proposal aimed at breaking the deadlock in the junior doctors' dispute through fresh talks has been made by 22 medical colleges and faculties.They want planning for the imposing of new junior doctors' contracts in England to be postponed for five days.In return, the British Medical Association is asked to suspend for five days any new threats of strikes.The BMA said it was prepared to agree, but the government said it was too late to suspend bringing the contracts in.However, the ""door remains open"" for talks, the Department of Health said.The colleges' joint statement, calling for what it calls a pause in the dispute so talks can resume, has been put out under the umbrella of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.Professor Dame Sue Bailey, its chairwoman, said: ""A five-day pause without 'ifs, buts or maybes', and with both sides in the dispute publicly committing to a serious attempt to reach a resolution through genuine dialogue, is obviously the only way out of this impasse.""Talks over the controversial new contract broke down in February.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continuing discussions.Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.Last week there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS.Consultants and senior nursing staff covered gaps caused by the walkouts and hospitals reported no problems with providing essential care.The junior doctors' committee of the BMA is meeting on Saturday to discuss its next move, including the possibility of escalating the industrial action.Until now there has been no prospect of further talks between the BMA and the government.Dr Johann Malawana, BMA junior doctor committee chairman, said: ""The government itself has admitted that there are serious, outstanding issues with the proposed contract.""As such, the BMA would be prepared to agree to this proposal and temporarily suspend industrial action so that talks can resume with a mutually agreed facilitator, if the government is also prepared to suspend the threat of imposition.""A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""It is now too late to change the process of bringing in contracts which is well under way throughout the country.""However, the door remains open to talk about implementation and many other non-contractual issues of concern to junior doctors - so if this intervention helps those talks to go ahead, we welcome that.""The academy statement was backed by the NHS Confederation, which represents leading health organisations.Rob Webster, its chief executive, said: ""We welcome the academy's proposal to create a safe space for a conversation between the parties about how we find a way out of this dispute.""Both sides should give serious consideration to an approach that would find support from across managerial and clinical leaders.""General Medical Council chairman Professor Terence Stephenson said:  ""We would support any initiative that sought to bring both sides together to resolve the issues before putting patients at further risk of harm."""
2016-05-04,Ministers in battle over Housing Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36201892,"The government remains in a race against time to get its promise to build 200,000 starter homes into law. Peers continue to defy ministers over its Housing Bill, voting to reinstate a number of measures rejected by MPs.They backed calls to give councils more room to consider alternative sources of affordable housing while allowing them to keep part of the money when they sell off high value homes.Ministers have made several concessions after suffering 18 defeats on the bill.The bill is ""ping-ponging"" between the two houses - with the government desperate to get it into law before the end of the current parliamentary session next week.If it fails to do so, it could see its manifesto commitment to building hundreds of thousands of ""starter homes"" in England and Wales delayed.MPs voted on Tuesday to reject 13 amendments to the Housing Bill demanded by the House of Lords. They backed higher rents for people with a household income of £31,000 or more (£40,000 in London) and plans to make councils sell ""high value"" homes to pay off the deficit.It was thought the Lords would have to water down some of its amendments after Housing Minister Brandon Lewis declared them budgetary measures, meaning the House of Commons has the final say on them.But the peers stood firm when the bill returned to the Lords on Wednesday, inflicting five defeats and forcing ministers to adjust their plans to push up rents for ""high income"" tenants of social housing in England.The Lords had voted to soften the impact of so-called ""pay to stay"" plans, which would see council tenants in England paying higher rents. Ministers have now said the minimum income threshold at which tenants would find themselves liable - £31,000 outside London and £40,000 in the capital - would only rise in line with inflation every year while the increases would come into force more gradually, with a taper rate of 15% rather than 20%.Speaking on Tuesday, Lyn Brown, Labour MP for West Ham, backed the Lords amendment, telling MPs: ""This is a tax on aspiration, and the idea that a family in London that earns £40,000 a year is rich is baloney. ""It costs an awful lot to live in this wonderful capital city of ours - something that the minister is failing to grasp.""'Damaging plans'The Lords also wanted guarantees high value properties sold off by councils to fund the government's plans to extend ""right to buy"" to housing association tenants in England would be replaced by similar homes in the same area, amid fears long-standing residents would be driven out of their home areas.The Lords may now have to water this amendment down after it was rejected by MPs in Tuesday night's vote.Mr Lewis said the government had made some concessions to the demands, but he accused peers of wanting to ""wreck"" the bill, which includes plans for more ""starter homes"".He told MPs: ""We are determined to deliver for Britain on our election promises. ""The manifesto on which this government was elected set out a very clear statement of intent about a viable extension of the right to buy, paid for by the sale of higher-value housing, and about 200,000 starter homes by the end of this Parliament.""Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""The Housing Bill will mean the loss of thousands of affordable homes while doing nothing to fix the causes of the last six years of failure on housing. ""Ministers showed yesterday that they still have no answers to concerns from housing experts, campaigners, MPs and peers.""He added: ""If ministers want to fix the housing crisis then they need to listen to the opposition coming from all sides and rethink their damaging plans."""
2016-05-04,"Turkey not joining EU soon, Cameron says",https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36205844,"Concerns over Turkey potentially joining the EU should not influence voters in the UK's forthcoming referendum, the PM has said.David Cameron said Turkey joining the 28-member bloc was ""not remotely on the cards"" and would take ""decades"".Turkey is currently in long-running negotiations for accession to the EU.Meanwhile, a Tory MP has threatened the PM with legal action if he does not remove pages from the government's main website arguing for EU membership.The prime minister made his comments about Turkey just hours after the European Commission gave its conditional backing for Turkish people to get visa-free travel inside Europe's passport-free Schengen area - which does not include the UK.The deal was offered in return for Turkey - which has a population of 80 million - taking back migrants who crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece, but it has sparked claims the country is on its way to full EU membership.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.However, Mr Cameron told the House of Commons Liaison Committee: ""I will be absolutely frank with you, I don't think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don't think it will happen for decades.""If you look at the facts, the facts are that it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they'd have a referendum on it.""I would say very clearly to people, if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don't think about it. It's not remotely on the cards. It's not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn't be.""He also told the committee:Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said the prime minister could ""expect a writ"" if pro-EU pages were kept on gov.uk in the four weeks leading up to the vote on 23 June.The home page of gov.uk website, which sets out details of government information and services, contains a hard link to a government website setting out the benefits of the EU membership.Mr Jenkin, a prominent Leave campaigner, said the government intended to keep all the pro-Remain pages on the gov.uk website during the 28-day ""purdah period"" leading up to the EU vote.Mr Jenkin said he had been told keeping the pages would contravene the Political Parties and Referendum Act, which governs the conduct of referendums in the UK. Mr Cameron said the government would be taking its own legal advice, adding:  ""It seems to me the right thing to do is to make sure that if there is a government website, it is not refreshed or updated during the purdah period.""But I would ask whether it was absolutely necessary to take something down. That would seem a rather extreme position."""
2016-05-04,UK 'to take child refugees from Europe',https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36200366,"David Cameron says the UK will take in more unaccompanied Syrian refugee children from Europe, although it has not committed to a specific figure.Ministers will talk to councils before deciding how many can be resettled. The UK currently takes children from refugee camps in Syria and its neighbours but there has been pressure to take some who are already in the EU.Labour said the announcement, made at Prime Minister's Questions, did not go far enough and more action was needed.The government agreed in January to take some lone child refugees directly from North Africa and Middle East - but rejected calls to accept 3,000 children who had made it to Europe because it did not want to encourage others to make the ""lethal"" journey.Now, in a change of heart, children registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March - when the EU struck its refugee deal with Turkey - will be eligible for resettlement in the UK.The government said the retrospective nature of the scheme would avoid creating a ""perverse incentive"" for families to entrust their children to people traffickers. It would mean the UK can focus on the ""most vulnerable children already in Europe without encouraging more to make the journey"", Downing Street said.Mr Cameron, who has been facing the threat of a Conservative backbench rebellion in a vote next week over the issue, said he had accepted a revised amendment to the Immigration Bill put forward by Labour peer Lord Dubs.He told MPs: ""I am also talking to Save the Children to see what we can do more, particularly about children who came here before the EU-Turkey deal was signed.""What I don't want us to do is to take steps that will encourage people to make this dangerous journey because otherwise our actions, however well-meaning they will be, could result in more people dying than more people getting a good life.""Ministers get irritated when critics suggest the government's not done enough to help Syrian refugees. They point to the thousands already promised help through resettlement programmes and billions of pounds of aid from the UK. But a majority of MPs demanded more action to help unaccompanied children.   David Cameron has always insisted that nothing must be done to encourage refugees to make the dangerous journey to Europe so now ministers have found a compromise. It's a political solution to avoid a defeat in the Commons but Tory MPs and several charities have called it ""tremendous"".      The implementation of the programme now depends on local authorities who have to make sure they have the funding, school places and social service support that many of these traumatised children will require. Downing Street hasn't put a figure on how many might be helped, but the expectation is that it will be thousands and Conservative MPs have promised to keep up the campaigning.         There does remain some concern though, that what's been announced won't help the most vulnerable, who might not have registered and who've disappeared from the system altogether. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, who pressed Mr Cameron on the issue, said he welcomed what he said appeared to be the ""beginning of a U-turn"".Mr Cameron has been under pressure to accept 3,000 child refugees who have made it into Europe unaccompanied.But the government says the number will depend on what councils can cope with.Funding will be made available from central government for those councils willing to take in unaccompanied child migrants, said a source.Immigration minister James Brokenshire told a meeting of Conservative MPs he was going to write to all local councils and ask them to gauge capacity - but warn them they should expect at least as many unaccompanied children as the UK took last year.Local authorities will be expected to share responsibility because some had been overburdened, he told the MPs.The Local Government Association said councils were ready to ""play their part"" but wanted more clarity on long-term funding and how the national dispersal mechanism will work. Save the Children said Mr Cameron had ""offered a lifeline to these vulnerable children,"" adding: ""This announcement echoes Britain's proud history of offering safety at times of great crisis and we want to thank the members of parliament who have led the way in championing this cause, as well as the British public who have opened their hearts to refugee children.""Conservative MP Heidi Allen - who had said she was prepared to vote against the government and support an amendment calling on the government to accept more unaccompanied children -  described the announcement as ""tremendous news"".But a spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Cameron had not gone far enough - and they wanted to see ""greater action and more generosity"".Labour MP Yvette Coooper, who chairs the party's refugee taskforce, said more detail was needed about what Mr Cameron is planning.""He was wrong to claim last week that child refugees alone in Europe don't need help, so I hope he will be clear about that now and set out what the government will do next,"" she said.In a letter to David Cameron, Sir Erich Reich, chairman of Kindertransport-Association of Jewish Refugees, had called on the PM to do more to help ""the most vulnerable victims"" of the Syrian conflict.He said it was ""incumbent on us to provide sanctuary to those in need"". Mr Cameron rejected comparisons with the ""Kindertransport"" scheme that helped Jewish children escape from the Nazis, at Prime Minister's Questions.""To say that the Kindertransport is taking today children from France or Germany or Italy, safe countries that are democracies, I think that is an insult to those countries,"" he told MPs.But he added: ""We're going to go round the local authorities and see what more we can do, but let's stick to the principle we should not be taking in new arrivals to Europe.""In September 2015 the government said the UK would accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years. And last month the government said it would accept up to 3,000 more refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the Middle East and North Africa by 2020.In his letter, Sir Erich, who was among thousands of Jewish children rescued from Nazi Germany, said he had learned of the rejection of the resettlement proposal ""with great sadness"".He added: ""I strongly urge you and your colleagues to reconsider how we can intervene to help some of the most vulnerable victims of an internecine conflict that has claimed the lives of thousands of people and displaced millions.""The echoes of the past haunt many of my fellow Kinder and I whose fate similarly rested with members of the British parliament.""I feel it is incumbent on us to once again demonstrate our compassion and human-kindness to provide sanctuary to those in need."""
2016-05-04,Scargill calls for Orgreave inquiry,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-36199621,"Former miners' union president Arthur Scargill has called for an inquiry into the 1984 Battle of Orgreave disorder.Thousands of miners and police clashed at the South Yorkshire coking plant.A redacted version of an IPCC report into police conduct was published last year, with the police watchdog now considering releasing a full copy.The Yorkshire Post reported the redacted sections show the same senior officers were involved both in the aftermath of Orgreave and Hillsborough.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Scargill, who led the National Union of Mineworkers during the 1984-85 miners' strike, said: ""I want to see a full open public inquiry and the individuals responsible should be named.""I accuse those individuals now.""What was the 'Battle of Orgreave'?Mr Scargill, 78, said the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the late Conservative politician Sir Leon Brittan, the government at large and various police forces were to blame for the ""bloodshed"".A South Yorkshire Police (SYP) spokesman said: ""SYP is aware of the campaign for a public inquiry, however it is a matter for the Home Secretary and Home Office.""  Mr Scargill claims there were similarities between the way police acted in the aftermath of Orgreave and events following the Hillsborough disaster.  He said: ""A full inquiry will reveal that they concocted stories, they told lies.""For example, they said when I was knocked unconscious that I slipped on a grassy bank. When a photograph was produced it showed I'd been hit by a policeman's short shield.""The so-called Battle of Orgreave saw thousands of pickets confront huge lines of police outside the coke works near Rotherham. Miners wanted to stop lorry loads of coke leaving for the steel works, with police holding them back.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was currently examining whether there were any remaining legal issues preventing the full publication of its report.A spokeswoman for the police watchdog said the 2015 report had been redacted as a result of legal matters, including some relating to the Hillsborough inquests, which concluded last month.She said: ""We are now considering whether the legal issues that prompted the report being redacted still remain.""One key consideration is that the IPCC and Operation Resolve are conducting criminal investigations into the events at Hillsborough and its aftermath.""As a result we must now carefully consider whether we can publish an unredacted version of the report at this stage without compromising the integrity of the ongoing criminal investigations.""Operation Resolve is the continuing police inquiry into the events of the day of the Hillsborough disaster and its lead-up.In 2015, the IPCC said the passage of time meant allegations of assault and misconduct at Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham ""could not be pursued"".Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said the IPCC report contained proof ""underhand tactics were used first against South Yorkshire miners before being deployed to much more deadly effect against Liverpool supporters [at Hillsborough]"".He said: ""As I've always said, we won't have the truth about Hillsborough until we have the full truth about Orgreave.""Campaigners have called on Dave Jones, the new interim chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, to open up the force's archives on Orgreave.The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said they want Mr Jones to intervene in their legal bid to push Home Secretary Theresa May to hold a public inquiry.Louise Haigh, Labour MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: ""It's really important that these documents are made public and the Home Secretary can then commission a full public inquiry just as she did with Hillsborough.""These documents are only the starting point of that.""

2016-05-04,EU exit 'could take years to complete',https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36195499,"Leaving the EU would mean ""difficult and lengthy negotiations"" that could take years to complete, peers say.The Lords EU Committee said determining the rights of two million UK nationals living in the EU would be a ""complex and daunting"" part of exit talks. While they do not recommend a vote either way, peers say trade deals between the EU and non-EU states take between four and nine years on average. Leave campaigners argue a UK-EU Treaty should be wrapped up in two years.A separate report from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, also published on Wednesday, suggests curbs on in-work benefits for EU citizens negotiated by David Cameron are unlikely to result in a large reduction in migration to the UK.It said a ""large majority"" of recent EU migrants were not claiming benefits of any kind.If the UK voted to leave in the referendum on 23 June, it would not mean an immediate exit from the EU. This issue covers travel for leisure or work, and living in other EU countries.The prime minister could trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides for a two-year process for negotiating the terms of withdrawal and a departing state's future relations with the EU.But there is some debate as to whether this is the best method for leaving the EU and whether it should happen immediately after the vote.The cross-party committee warned that negotiations for withdrawal and to establish a new relationship with the EU would take longer than the two years allowed under Article 50.The committee, which took evidence from two EU law experts, said one of the most complex parts of the talks would be establishing the rights of UK citizens resident in other member states to access health care, schooling and employment.The negotiations, it added, would also have to deal with the reciprocal rights of EU nationals living in the UK.""We don't take a view on whether the UK should leave the EU or not,"" said Lord Boswell, the former Conservative minister who chairs the committee.""But it is clear that if that's what people decide, withdrawal would mean difficult and lengthy negotiations.""""It's not possible to predict exactly how long it would take, but comparable international trade deals have taken on average between four and nine years.""Peers also say the process of reviewing and disentangling the UK from EU law would take years to complete - with the government having to assess which laws it wished to keep.Vote Leave, the official group campaigning for an EU exit, said the UK faced a choice between ""handing more money and power to Brussels or to take back control"".""It [the report] also torpedoes the claims that the EU wouldn't do a trade deal with us after we vote leave - it's in everyone's interest on all sides to strike a deal after the UK takes back the power over trade.""UKIP said the committee was made up of Europhiles and its findings were ""partial nonsense"". Remain campaigners argue there is no guarantee that expats living in the EU would be able to stay in the event of Brexit."
2016-05-04,EU upholds tough rules on tobacco packs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36200778,"Rules that will drastically alter cigarette packaging are set to be adopted, after big tobacco firms failed to block new European Union laws.Europe's highest court upheld a law that will standardise packaging and ban the advertising of e-cigarettes.The Court of Justice found the laws ""did not go beyond the limits of what is appropriate and necessary"".Under the new rules health warnings will have to cover 65% of the front and back of cigarette packaging.The rules are due to take effect from 20 May, but the new packets will not be on sale until stocks of existing cartons have been cleared over the next year.Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco (BAT) challenged the proposed legislation.They argued that the European Union was overstepping its authority to direct laws in member states.Reacting to the court's findings a BAT spokesperson said: ""We stand by our belief that the Tobacco Products Directive is a clear example of the EU overstepping the limits of its authority. The reality is that many elements of the directive are disproportionate, distort competition, and fail to respect the autonomy of the Member States."" Individual EU states are also working on new packaging rules.In the UK, the government wants to introduce tobacco packs with plain packaging - a move which is also being challenged by big tobacco companies.The law was supposed to come into effect later this month, but that could be delayed as on 18 May the High Court is due to rule on the legal challenge to the legislation from the tobacco industry.""What is clear from the [EU] directive and the judgment is that measures that go beyond the requirements of the directive, such as plain packaging, must still comply with the wider principles of EU and international law."" said the BAT spokesperson.""Whether plain packaging meets these requirements is currently the subject of ongoing litigation before the English Courts and the WTO [World Trade Organization].It is likely that the losing party would launch an appeal over the High Court's decision."
2016-05-04,Call to stop council tax bailiffs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36193490,"Vulnerable residents with council tax debts should be given breathing space to repay arrears rather than face the threat of bailiffs, two charities say.Debt charities StepChange and the Money Advice Trust have reported rising levels of council tax debt.They argue that increased use of bailiffs by councils could deepen these residents' financial problems.The Local Government Association (LGA) said that bailiffs were only used as a last resort.The LGA said that cuts to local government funding meant that some people who had previously been exempt from paying council tax were now having to pay.""Significant cuts mean many [councils] have had little choice but to reduce council tax discounts for the working-age poor or low-income families...to avoid finding even more savings from spending on local services to meet the shortfall,"" said councillor Claire Kober, of the LGA.The two charities say about a quarter of callers to their debt services have council tax arrears.StepChange said that its clients were typically in arrears by £961 last year, up from £717 in 2011. There was a slight fall in arrears in 2013, but otherwise there had been a sharp rise each year between 2011 and 2015.The charities argue that the threat of bailiffs causes extra stress and anxiety to those in debt, so there should be a delay before these collection agencies are called in.""It may come as a surprise to people that public bodies are more aggressive in pursuing debts than many private companies,"" said Mike O'Connor, chief executive of StepChange.""This counterproductive approach needs to stop immediately and be replaced with one that is fairer and more constructive.""Some councils rule out bailiff action against anyone who receives council tax support - as they are already considered to be financially vulnerable. Such a policy should be adopted nationwide, the charities said.They also want a statutory breathing space scheme that guarantees anyone seeking debt advice is given a temporary freeze on debt interest and charges, and that any enforcement action is halted.  The LGA argued that giving people more time to pay could have unintended consequences.""We agree that bailiffs should only ever be used as a last resort. Before the situation reaches a stage where bailiffs are involved several letters should have been written, people should have been encouraged to apply for financial support, and efforts should be made to arrange new payment plans or to attach the debt to a salary,"" said the LGA's Ms Kober.""It is in everyone's interest to ensure those struggling to pay their council tax bills are set up on affordable and sustainable payment plans. However, there is always a risk that the longer a debtor goes on without paying, their repayment instalments will become even more difficult for them to manage and the debt will take longer to clear.""With 97% of council tax collected without the need for bailiffs or court action, the Department for Communities and Local Government said that the vast majority of residents paid on time.""We have also made it easier for households to pay their bills in monthly instalments and published guidance to stop bad practices from aggressive bailiffs,"" a spokesman for the DCLG said.""However, every penny of council tax that is not collected means a higher bill for everyone in the area so we expect councils to be sympathetic to those in genuine hardship, but take appropriate action to chase up outstanding debts, while delivering a fair deal for local families."""
2016-05-04,EU sets out road to Turkey visa deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36199811,"The European Commission has given conditional backing for Turkish people to get visa-free travel inside Europe's passport-free Schengen area.It says Turkey has made good progress on key conditions, but work remains to be done ""as a matter of urgency"".The change could take effect from July, but first it requires approval by the European Parliament and member states.The deal was offered in return for Turkey taking back migrants who crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece.The EU fears that without it, Turkey will not control migration.The Turkish foreign minister,  Mevlut Cavusoglu, welcomed the recommendation, saying the visa proposals have opened a new page in Turkey's relations with the EU.What is the Schengen agreement?Turks look to EU to scrap visasThe visa liberalisation deal remains controversial in a number of capitals across the EU, but the Commission praised Turkey for its progress in fulfilling its requirements, particularly in recent weeks.Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: ""There is still work to be done as a matter of urgency, but if Turkey sustains the progress made, they can meet the remaining benchmarks.""  The Commission outlined several outstanding issues, with Turkey required to do more to tackle corruption and bring its laws on terrorism in line with European standards, among others.Full European Commission StatementThe commission is also giving Turkey until the end of the year to upgrade its passports, so that they meet the latest biometric standards. Mr Timmermans stressed that no Turkish citizen would enter the EU without a visa if they do not have a biometric passport with a facial image and fingerprint data. He said: ""I would rather have somebody at my border with a biometric passport where I can be sure that the person carrying the passport is actually mentioned in the passport, than a person with an old-fashioned passport and a paper visa.""The deal will scrap the requirement for Turks to get a three-month, short-stay Schengen visa for tourism or business trips. Visa-free travel will apply to all EU Member States except for Ireland and the UK, and to the four Schengen associated countries - Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.But it will not grant Turks the right to get a job in Europe. Separate to the deal with Turkey, the Commission also proposed granting visa-free travel to citizens of Kosovo. The tiny Balkan state declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and is still not recognised by Belgrade and five EU states. Under the plan, Kosovans with biometric passports would be able to enter the Schengen zone without a visa and stay for up to 90 days.Turkey has threatened to stop taking back migrants from Greece if the EU fails to deliver on visa liberalisation.The large influx of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe from Turkey, and from North Africa, has caused a political crisis among EU states.Under the EU-Turkey agreement, migrants who have arrived illegally in Greece since 20 March are to be sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or if their claim is rejected.For each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey, the EU is to take in another Syrian who has made a legitimate request.78.7mPopulation11.1% Unemployment 2.75m Syrian refugees registered with UN 151 out of 180 countries on World Press Freedom Index The deal will now be sent to the European Parliament, which has already said it will not vote on the proposal until the Commission confirms all of the conditions have been met.  Concerns have been raised in Parliament before that the visa-waiver looks like a reward for Turkey, because of its co-operation in the migrant crisis. It says Ankara falls short of many EU human rights benchmarks.MEPs accept that Turkey is a ""key strategic partner"" for the EU. But they say reforms have slowed down in Turkey in many areas, including freedom of speech and judicial independence. MEPs have also voiced concern about continuing fighting in south-eastern Turkey between government troops and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels, whom the government in Ankara describes as ""terrorists"". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
2016-05-04,Quarter of UK care homes 'risk closure',https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36200855,"More than a quarter of care homes in the UK are in danger of going out of business within three years, figures obtained by BBC Radio Four suggest. About 5,000 homes are at risk of closure because they carry too much debt and do not make enough profit to cover loan repayments.On average, care homes make £17,647 in profit before tax, the research found. The Department of Health said it was working to make sure care providers had ""strong contingency plans"".The research, carried out for Radio 4's You and Yours programme by business risk analysts, found individual care homes were borrowing about 61% of the value of the business on average - a figure that amounted to £4bn across the industry. There are 20,000 care homes in the UK, which are operated by 5,871 individual owners who make, on average, about £60,000 profit as operators. Business risk adviser Nick Hood, from Opus Business Services, said the figures made investment difficult.  He added: ""It leaves a very small pot to encourage people to stay in this market and run care homes and to invest in them and to create the extra capacity that we all know this market is going to need as the baby boomers get old and need to go into care."" Much of the funding for care homes comes from private equity firms and US real estate companies, but You and Yours reporter Samantha Fenwick - who looked at the issue for the programme - said there was concern these investors would want big and quick returns on their investments.She said the profitability of care homes had also been hit by rising costs, including the new national living wage of £7.20.John Strowbridge, managing director of Avery Health Care Group, which operates 47 care homes across England, said the new living wage was costing it an additional £2m a year. He also said the fees provided to operators to care for local authority residents were often not enough to match care costs.  Mr Strowbridge added: ""And if it continues, as it will do with the national living wage into next year and the year after, the number of local authority clients that care homes can admit across the country, not just Northamptonshire, will continue to be reduced in everybody's care homes, because you just cannot afford to take local authority clients anymore.""  Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents care providers, said: ""What we're actually finding is we are in that very difficult situation where responsible providers are going to think to themselves, 'I can't do this very well, I may as well come out of it' and I think that's the worry that we have.""  The Department of Health said it recognised some care providers were ""finding the current market challenging"".A spokeswoman said: ""No-one will be left without care if a home closes. ""Following the failure of Southern Cross, we empowered the Care Quality Commission [independent regulator for England] to monitor the finances of the largest care providers and to provide early warning of likely insolvencies so we can better protect vulnerable people who use their services.""There will be more on this story on You and Yours at 12:15 BST on Wednesday on BBC Radio Four."
2016-05-04,A guide to 2016's elections,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35813119,"Britain goes to the polls in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years. They are quite separate from the EU referendum, which is due to take place on 23 June.Here is a rundown of the elections taking place on 5 May:Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area.Polls close at 22:00. After that, counting begins, with the results coming in at different points over the next 24 hours.Watch: Which seats are up for grabs?In London, counting the votes will begin the day after polling day, with the new mayor expected to be announced from mid afternoon. Votes cast for the London Assembly will also be counted on Friday.Declarations in Scotland and Wales are expected overnight on Thursday, and during Friday in Northern Ireland.Where to watch the results on the BBCAn election special, presented by Huw Edwards, starts at 23:45 on BBC One, after Question Time, with coverage throughout the night as results come in. On BBC Radio 5 Live, Jim Naughtie and Anna Foster present an election special from 00:30.All the latest developments are on the BBC politics website, with rolling updates on the Election Live page.Until polls close, we are limited in what we report.There are also dedicated programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Anyone 18 or over on 5 May who is a British citizen living in the UK, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, or an EU citizen living in the UK, can vote in the English, Welsh, London or Northern Irish contests.  In Scotland, 16 and 17-year-olds are also eligible to vote.If you have received a polling card through the post then you are registered to vote. If not, you may need to check with your local authority that you are still on the electoral register, particularly if you have moved house recently. The deadline to register was Monday, 18 April.Most people vote in person at a polling station on the day. It is normally a local school or community centre - the location will be on your polling card. You do not need to take the polling card with you in order to vote. A member of staff will give you a ballot paper with a list of candidates and parties on it. Put a cross in the box next to the ones you want to vote for. The deadline to apply to vote by post has now passed. If you have already applied, ballot papers should be completed and returned, ensuring you leave enough time for them to arrive by 10:00 on 5 May. If you have a specific, long-term reason that you can't vote in person, such as a disability or being overseas, you can apply to allow someone to vote for you. Full details about proxy votes, as they are known, are on the Electoral Commission website.If you are suddenly incapacitated or taken ill, you can apply to vote by proxy for medical reasons up until 17:00 on polling day. Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up. SNP - 69 seatsLabour - 37Conservative - 15Lib Dems - 5Greens - 2What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.WalesWhat happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.Labour - 30 seatsConservative - 14Plaid Cymru - 11Lib Dem - 5What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game. What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.DUP - 38 seatsSinn Fein - 29UUP - 16SDLP - 14Alliance - 8Others - 3What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.Assembly seats after 2012 electionLabour - 12 seatsConservative - 9Green - 2 Lib Dem - 2 What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives.  The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance. The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 ""omnishambles"" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England. All seats are up for grabs in three councils: Sheffield, Knowsley and RotherhamMetropolitan boroughs: A third of council seats are up for election in 32 of 36 Metropolitan boroughs including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sunderland.

If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The by-election was triggered by the decision of Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly. Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May. What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents.

2016-05-04,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-04,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-04,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36195593,"The claim: Leaving the EU would put £250bn of trade at risk, according to Britain Stronger in Europe.Reality Check verdict: The group has taken a set of figures predicting the benefits of EU membership and used that to reach a figure for the risks of leaving. It would not necessarily work like that. Also, the figures include imports, a fall in which would not necessarily be a bad thing.Britain Stronger in Europe (BSIE) says £250bn of trade would be at risk if the UK were to leave the European Union.In a press release announcing the number, former Chancellor Alistair Darling said: ""Those wanting to leave the EU want to pull Britain out of the single market, which would mean introducing tariffs and barriers to our trade and putting billions of vital trade at risk.""The figure is based on part of the Treasury's work on the impact of a Brexit.The Treasury compared the amount of trade done between EU members with the amount done by non-members.That's a tricky thing to do. While the method chosen is reasonable, the conclusions should not be seen as precise.Its analysis concluded trade with EU countries was 76% higher as a result of Britain being in the EU than it would be if Britain were not. It also identified smaller benefits coming from membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), and from other free trade agreements negotiated by the EU. For the EEA it was 44%, and for the other free trade agreements it was 17%.BSIE has taken those Treasury figures for gains from EU membership, reversed them, and used them to conclude £250bn of trade would be at risk if the UK were to leave the EU.But looking at how much trade is increased by signing a free trade agreement is not the same as predicting that amount would be at risk from leaving. The effect of leaving may or may not be the reverse of the effect of joining - there are no examples of countries leaving the EU that could form the basis for the research.To reach the £250bn figure, BSIE has started with the total amount of trade the UK did with the EU in 2014, which was about £520bn.Remember, that's a figure for both exports and imports.But some might think a reduction in imports could be a good thing, helping reduce the country's trade deficit.If you assume leaving the EU would have the exact reverse effect of joining, then a 76% increase equates to a 43% fall (imagine you were doing £100 of trade - if it increased by 76%, there would be £176 - you would have to reduce it by 43% to get back to £100). So, you take 43% off EU trade, a loss of £224bn. Similarly, you take 31% (that's the reverse of the 44%) off the £29bn of EEA trade, a loss of £9bn. These are the figures BSIE reaches. Its figure for the trade with countries with which the EU has other free trade agreements, however, looks a bit off.The Treasury says trade with these countries has been increased by 17% as a result of EU membership. To reverse a 17% rise, you would need a 14.5% fall.BSIE says the UK did £62bn of such trade in 2014.And losing 14.5% of that would be a loss of £9bn, not the £14bn claimed by BSIE.So, the total comes to £243bn, not the £247bn suggested by BSIE.But splitting hairs about £4bn or £5bn here and there may be flattering the accuracy of the prediction.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-04,Six reasons,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36202424,"Donald Trump is now close to being assured the Republican nomination in the US presidential race, something few would have predicted 12 months ago.The Democratic race is still going, but it looks increasingly likely that Hillary Clinton will be the nominee, despite Vermont senator Bernie Sanders' win in Indiana on Tuesday.The picture has now become clear enough that we know that whatever happens, the outcome will be historic. This is how.When Barack Obama first walked through the White House front door back in January 2009, he was aged 47, and was the fifth-youngest president in history. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest, at 42 years and 322 days.The next one will be a fair bit older, whatever happens.Bernie Sanders will be 75 on inauguration day on 20 January, almost six years older than the oldest president on inauguration, Ronald Reagan.Donald Trump celebrates his 70th birthday on 14 June, so he too would be the oldest president in history.Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, turns 69 some two weeks before the election, and would become the second-oldest president on inauguration. She would replace William Henry Harrison, who became president in 1841 (and was the last president born on British soil).Both scenarios - Trump v Clinton or Trump v Sanders - will see the first presidential contest between New Yorkers since 1944, when the governor of New York, Thomas E Dewey, ran against the incumbent, Franklin D Roosevelt.Whoever wins this time will become the first New Yorker in office in 71 years when the inauguration takes place next year.(And yes, we know Mrs Clinton was born in Chicago, but she was a senator from New York and lives in the state).If Mr Trump wins, we could be looking at the least amount of money spent by a winning candidate for some time.Federal Election Commission records show he spent $49m (£34m) up to the end of March, of which $36m is his own money.No other candidate since Al Gore in 2000 ($126m) has spent as little. Hillary Clinton is on some $187m so far, by the way.Of course, Mr Trump could break out the chequebook given that he has more campaigning to do between now and November, but it looks likely he will come a long way under what Barack Obama spent last time round - almost $556m.A Trump win would be significant for another reason - no-one has been elected president in more than 60 years without experience as a governor or in Congress.Even then, the last president with no political experience, Dwight Eisenhower, was Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War Two, before he was elected to office in 1953.Before that, Herbert Hoover, who was president from 1929 to 1933, was previously an engineer and humanitarian.No previous candidate has ever owned a chain of casinos and hotels. But Mr Trump says his experience doing deals, and the fact he is not too tied to the Washington establishment, stand him in good stead.The long years Hillary Clinton has been on the Washington scene may make it easy to forget one fact: she would be the first female president if elected.The closest we have got before is when Republican John McCain surprisingly picked Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008, and when Democrat Walter Mondale named Geraldine Ferraro as his vice-presidential pick in 1984.Neither won the presidency.Amazingly, only two Democrats have directly succeeded another Democrat as US president. The most recent was James Buchanan, who was president from 1857 to 1861. Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson were both vice-presidents who were named president when their predecessors died. They both then went on to win the next election.A Clinton win, therefore, would bring even more significance to the Democratic Party. This is how polls have changed over the past 10 months between the two frontrunners. Now there's only six months to go."
2016-05-04,What's the plan?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36203410,"In the last couple of days David Cameron has been under more and more pressure to change his mind and allow more child refugees, on their own and vulnerable in continental Europe, to come to the UK. And despite his refusal to budge just seven days ago, budge he has. But the plans the government is putting in place are not crystal clear. So what do we know about the ""plans"" and what details are still missing? Since September charities and some MPs have been calling on the government to offer homes in Britain to some of the thousands of child refugees who have already made it to mainland Europe. The government has continually said no.Ministers have been firm for months on the principle that it is far better to help those caught up in the migrant crisis in the region - in the camps and temporary accommodation in the Middle East and Africa than help those who are, they argue, in relative safety in European countries like Italy, France or Greece.The prime minister and his team have gone on the record on countless occasions making that case, and pointing out that the UK has been a far more effective and generous donor to the aid efforts in the region than any other European country. That's now changed. Downing Street diplomatically calls their new strategy a ""twin track"" - in other words, Number 10 has given way on a long held principle. Children who have made their way alone to Europe as migrants and who arrived in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March will now be eligible to come to the UK.Those who are selected, probably by aid workers on the ground in those countries, will be given five year residence permits for the UK, what was described to me as ""humanitarian visas"". What we also know is that the government was likely to lose the vote on this in the Commons next week. With the referendum campaign making everything tense, Number 10 was evidently just not willing to let that happen. But much about the plan is not yet clear. One source familiar with the conversations told me ""there have been five different positions in the last 36 hours"".Most crucially, what we do not yet know is how many children will be eligible, and how many will actually come. Discussions will now take place between the government and local councils over how many children on their own they could accommodate.  There is of course already considerable strain on resources in local authorities right across the countryWhat we also don't know is if there will be any extra cash available for councils who say they will take some in. But one source close to the negotiations told, ""if this is done properly it will mean thousands"". Finally, what is impossible to predict is what effect this will have on the ""pull factor"" - the concern ministers always voiced, that allowing more refugees to come to Britain once they were already in Europe would only encourage more to make the dangerous journey across the sea. But now the prime minister has ditched his principle and promised to open the door, campaigners, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and their own backbenchers will be pushing to make sure he does. "

2016-05-04,Election turn-off,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-36047612,"Fewer than 20% of people have chosen to vote in council elections in some areas of England over the past four years, BBC News analysis of voting patterns has shown. Why are people turning their back on local elections and how can they be drawn back to the ballot box?There were 41 out of about 2,500 wards in England where not even a fifth of the electorate turned out to choose a local councillor in 2012. This was the last time the seats being contested on 5 May this year were elected.The Electoral Reform Society said this amounted to ""serious democratic deficit"" and it is vital people vote and hold authorities to account.So how does the country solve a problem like low turnout? BBC News looks at some of the options.Online voting would improve turn out, according to market research conducted among 2,000 non-voters before the 2015 General Election.""We found two thirds of those who did not vote in 2010 said online voting would make them 'more likely' to vote,"" said Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of the research company Survation.""Improving access in this way might be particularly important for the 9% of non-voters who said they were 'not able to access a polling station or get a postal ballot'.""A commission set up by the Commons Speaker John Bercow said that by 2020 ""secure online voting should be an option for all voters"".Electronic voting is used in Estonia, where about 30% of participants cast their ballot online. So-called e-voting in the country has grown in popularity, from 30,275 users in the 2007 parliament elections to 176,491 people in 2015, while overall turnout has risen from 61.9% to 64.2%.However, the Estonian government says research suggests it did not play a great role in getting more people to vote.Arne Koitmäe, an adviser in the elections department of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu, said: ""[Researchers] found that while the aggregate turnout did increase marginally, they cannot really claim that this was only down to e-voting as such. ""Their conclusion was that e-voting simply makes voting easier but it doesn't address the underlining causes of turnout decline and it will not necessarily engage those for whom the problem lies in politics as such.""In Australia, non-voters face fines of $20 (about £11), rising to $170 (about £93) plus costs if they fail to pay.  In the 2013 General Election, turnout was more than 93%, compared with 66.1% in the UK in 2015. However, Australian voters spoiled 5.9% of ballot papers, while the UK electorate spoiled just 0.2%.Labour MP David Winnick tried to make voting a ""civic obligation"" in the UK via a Private Member's Bill, but it never made it beyond the Commons.But the Civitas think tank is concerned it might turn voting into ""one more thing that the state requires us to do, like filling in a tax form or taking the car for its MOT"".93%Turnout in Australia$20Fine for not voting1924 was when Australia introduced the legal duty to vote 14 countries enforce participation 17 countries say voting is compulsory but it is not enforced And Dr Annabelle Lever, a former fellow at the London School of Economics, has argued compulsory voting could see people without strong views coerced into voting a certain way by others.Writing in the journal Public Reason she said: ""Most protest, and all voting, depends for its success on the behaviour of other people, many of whom we will not know, many of whom will have interests and beliefs quite at odds with our own, and over whose behaviour we have no influence. ""People must, therefore, have rights to limit their participation in politics and, at the limit, to abstain.""The council ward with the lowest average turnout in 2012 was Liverpool Central, according to data from the Electoral Commission.The city council blames the low turnout on ""voter apathy"" for local elections among the large number of students registered in the ward. The ward saw a big rise in turnout in 2015 when the council elections coincided with the General Election.Ellie Hughes, who stood as a prospective councillor in Manchester in 2014 when she was an 18-year-old student, said she had tried to encourage friends to vote but ""a lot of people didn't even know there was a council election"".However, impartial campaign group Bite The Ballot, which encourages young people to vote, says that far from ""apathy"", many students feel councils do not want to consult with them.Campaigns manager Abiodun Michael Olatokun said: ""Young people are not apathetic. They do care deeply about the area they live in, about the standard of housing, the number of police officers and so on. Local democracy needs to be repurposed and made more accessible, with more online consultation and more use of social media.""Members of BBC Generation 2016, hand-picked to represent a broad cross-section of young people in the UK, agreed there was an issue with student engagement. They said this may be due to them being more interested in their home town than their place of study.Takyiwa Danso, 23, from London, said: ""You're kind of like a nomad, you don't really see yourself in one place. You probably care about where you're actually from.""Work to try to get more young people to vote in the council elections on 5 May has included writing to tenants of halls of residence to remind them.The Electoral Commission says students are difficult to keep track of on the electoral register because they might be on it at their parents' home, but not at their term time address. It also found similar difficulties among young private renters. MPs and English councillors are elected by the ""first past the post"" system. The candidate with the most votes wins.Katie Ghose, chief executive of The Electoral Reform Society, says countries with proportional representation typically have higher turnouts ""as people feel their votes actually count"".It suggests moving to proportional representation, such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in local government elections in Northern Ireland and Scotland. STV involves ranking candidates in order of preference.On its website, the society also lists the disadvantages of STV, saying the count takes longer, can lead to larger constituencies and result in people voting for the candidates ""in the order they appear on the ballot"".In 2011 a referendum on changing the voting system for MPs to the ""alternative vote"" saw 68% of voters say no. Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned against it, said at the time: ""It can mean someone who's not really wanted by anyone winning an election because they were the least unliked.""Elections for police and crime commissioners use the ""supplementary vote"" system if there are more than two candidates. Voters choose a first and second preference.However, when the positions were first elected in 2012, national turnout was a record low at fewer than 15%. Lack of awareness about the elections was the most common reason given.When Survation asked 2,096 non-voters what would persuade them to cast a ballot, the most popular answer - at 39% was  ""other"".Mr Lyons Lowe said: ""Our major study of non-voters revealed that in most cases, non-voters have the same concerns about political issues that voters have - creating a stable economy, promoting jobs, reducing poverty, reforming welfare and protecting the NHS. ""The key difference between voters and non-voters is that the latter are not making the connection between these issues in principle and the political and electoral system in practice.""Only 19% of non-voters gave 'no interest in politics' as their main reason for not voting, compared with 42% who said either parties and candidates are all the same or what they believe isn't represented by the parties or candidates. ""When asked what might make them more likely to cast a vote, many respondents wanted more information about the parties and candidates, but a significant minority wrote verbatim comments within the research that they wanted better candidates to vote for, or else that there simply was nothing that would persuade them to vote.""Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area."
2016-05-04,Olympian record?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36170239,"Boris Johnson's eight years as London Mayor comes to an end this week when his successor will be elected. But what legacy does he leave for the capital?Cast your mind back to the summer of 2007, when the Conservatives were a party in search of a mayoral candidate. When Boris Johnson's name was first mooted, it was met with incredulity and mockery from many quarters - and blank denial from officials.  But even critics who dismissed him as a clown could see instantly the possibilities for all the wit, charm and intellectualism. And Ken Livingstone realised instantly that the Henley MP could well prove to be his nemesis.Boris Johnson's allies say he helped London come through the economic crash and surfed an Olympic wave to make the capital feel good about itself again. The London mayoralty was not just the making of Boris Johnson, more his salvation.It allowed him a second chance to build a credible political career after his first foundered on reports about his personal life, tabloid ridicule and parliamentary mediocrity.The speeches now marking his farewell from City Hall have underlined the positive trends to come out of it. He has pointed to falling crime, rising employment, an efficient transport system, greater life expectancy even, as evidence of his inspirational leadership and steadiness at the helm. But did he repay the voters' faith and make enough use of the powers and levers at his disposal?He certainly defied - in fact capitalised on - low expectations and serious underestimation. In itself it showed a kind of genius. The comic dishevelment engaged; the harrumphing humour disarmed. And nothing blunted the ambition and political calculation.He owes London big, having arrived at City Hall in 2008 with a scant knowledge of and little past documented interest in the affairs of the capital. He leaves having amassed a broad experience of how to run things - furnished, effectively, with a crash course in governance.But if his personal popularity appears to have been buoyed by - or survived, depending on your point of view - two terms in office, does he also now demand to be considered credible as an administrator, as someone who made a difference? Mr Johnson exploited brilliantly the occasion of London 2012, long in the planning. To a large extent his first mayoral term was preoccupied with the Games, and ensuring he was still in place to enjoy the spoils by winning his second term in office just three months before the global sporting event took place in his city.But many critical observers feel that after that glorious month, the second half of his mayoralty was low both on substance and strategy - not disguised by the occasional ""grand vision"" for the capital in 2020 or 2050 or beyond.He can rightly claim to have helped set east London on the way to an Olympic infrastructure legacy. Homes are being built (although many at prices unheard of in the area a few years ago), and there's an academic, cultural and sporting hub taking shape (even if West Ham United Football Club got a supreme deal to move into the iconic stadium).But the transformed life chances promised for the local population did not materialise from the legacy programmes to help the long-term jobless. Elsewhere, he derived much political capital from the progress of Crossrail, but other major infrastructure projects were hard to come by. Small pots of cash appeared now and then from a chancellor with whom he had a less than warm relationship, for feasibility studies into river crossings and other transport links.In the main, critics argue, this has been about reinstating the ideas of Ken Livingstone that could have got off the ground years ago, and that it characterises Mr Johnson's time more as hiatus than progress. Mr Johnson paints a brighter picture of his regeneration in ""opportunity areas"" where new communities are taking shape. He often points at Battersea's crumbling old power station, where the Northern Line is being extended, two new stations built and a cluster of very tall buildings emerging around the US embassy and a Chinese-backed luxury hotel. Little taxpayers' money has been necessary.But this too tells its own story: vast amounts of Malaysian money, lots of off-plan foreign buying but virtually no affordable housing. Plans for homes for more than 20,000 people, but not one new state secondary school. And the only health facility happening so far?  A private clinic. Not the kind of community some hoped would be created.Overall on housing, Mr Johnson can claim that numerically he built more affordable homes than Mr Livingstone. But ""affordability"" is now more loosely defined. And once the money injected by Gordon Brown's government ran out, the trajectory was downwards: 55,000 affordable homes in Johnson's first term; 45,000 in his second.He talks of looking out of his City Hall window at the cranes and diggers he says signify a revival, a building boom even. But he's been in charge at a time of arguably London's worst housing crisis. Did he do what he could? Although the capital's population is rising by 100,000 each year - and for all the flexible non-prescriptive approach, warm encouragement to developers and removal of barriers to build - only 5,000 affordable new homes were completed last year as Mr Johnson prepared to leave the scene.There have been operational transport trends to celebrate. Punctuality and performance on the Tube improved, and the London Overground rail network has flourished. However, relations with the unions remained strained, and no trust was established. It has led to the introduction of a weekend all-night Tube service being delayed.Mr Johnson will certainly be remembered for a fondness for monuments: visual statements like the Thames cable car (completed), the Garden Bridge (a work in progress) and the ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture (currently being modified to include a slide).What has remained undimmed is his sense of place and liveability. He has planted trees and encouraged urban horticulture, and tried to keep alive the Olympic volunteering spirit. But he embraced skyscrapers too warmly for many and his vision of ""space-sharing"" - where motorists, cyclists and pedestrians co-existed in a kind of highway harmony - soon fell by the wayside, with traffic congestion now right back up there as a major gripe and a big problem left for his successor to sort out.He will always be associated with bikes, and more people are now cycling in London than ever before. Yet the ""cycling revolution"" has come along a perilous pot-holed path. A sponsorship deal with Barclays for the hire scheme wasn't good enough for him to fulfil the promise to make it self-financing, and the first iteration of a new network of cycle routes had to be re-thought after death and injury.He faced uncomfortable months, when he was accused of failing to match a tally-ho enthusiasm on cycling with safe public policy. Yet today segregated cycle lanes are being introduced, which it is hoped could lead to a step-change in habits and give the outgoing mayor a genuine two-wheeled legacy.Just as awkward for a time was the test of leadership that was his response to the phone-hacking scandal. He dismissed it originally as ""codswallop"", and was accused of not using his office to push the Metropolitan police to do more sooner - something he denied at the time.Helped by his own considerable success as a journalist, he's been assiduous in keeping friends in the right places. His highly remunerative column still engages readers of the Telegraph and he holidays at the Tuscan villa of the owner of the Independent and Evening Standard. All good positioning for the leadership manoeuvres ahead.But did he deploy his London mandate to the full?On top of the direct powers and budget responsibilities of the office comes the vast scope to influence. And with Mr Johnson, themes came and went.For a while it looked as if the life chances of young people would become a major focus. He pledged to sponsor at least 10 academies, partnered with business. Just four materialised, one was deemed by Ofsted to be struggling, and the programme was discontinued.There was energy devoted to gangs and rehabilitating young offenders. But the mayor made exaggerated claims about the success of a flagship youth offending scheme, and with ""payment by results"" hampering the project, this too fell off the mayoral agenda. Meanwhile, violent crime is starting to rise again.It could be argued that austerity and difficult finances made the synergy between Conservative mayor and a Conservative-led government less fruitful for the capital than many expected - hindered perhaps by rivalries and resentments.On various occasions Mr Johnson irked the prime minister, though David Cameron never betrayed it publicly. The mayor blamed police cuts at the time of the 2011 summer riots, talked unhelpfully about welfare changes in terms of ""Kosovo-style"" ethnic cleansing, and objected loudly when a Cabinet reshuffle appeared to signal a shift towards further expansion at Heathrow.His relationship with the Home Secretary Theresa May - never warm - found a new chill when she refused to approve the use of his (already paid for) second-hand German water cannon.As they began to emerge as Mr Cameron's two most likely successors, Messrs Johnson and Osborne jousted behind the scenes over what London needed and what it would be given.  At City Hall, the mayor left much of the detail and heavy-lifting to a cadre of deputies and advisers. The verdict of many who have watched him most closely is that he has often been pragmatic, rarely letting the best be the enemy of the good.But a big question raised is over the limited nature of what he set out to achieve and the perceived lack of ambition. Perhaps with the thoughts on the future, venturing little provided less chance of failing. In the story of London's progress under an elected mayoralty, will his time come to be seen mainly as an entertaining intermission?  Find out more about who's standing in the London elections."

New mayors will be elected in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford, with UK parliamentary by-elections held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside.Police and crime commissioners are also being elected in England and Wales.How the BBC reports polling dayPolling stations across the length and breadth of the country will open at 07:00 BST, with voting allowed until 22:00 BST.Thursday's polls are the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020.Elections to the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh and the devolved assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast last took place in 2011. The SNP has been in power in Scotland since 2007, while Labour has run the Welsh government since 1999.There is a power-sharing arrangement in place in the Northern Ireland Executive. The DUP and Sinn Fein have been the two largest parties at Stormont since 2011.

In all national elections, the BBC is required by electoral law to adopt a code of practice, ensuring fairness between candidates.The basic principle behind due impartiality in political coverage is set out in the agreement accompanying the BBC Charter. This requires the BBC over time to ""give due weight and prominence to all the main strands of argument and to all the main parties"". So, on polling day specifically, the BBC (like other broadcasters, though they are covered by the Ofcom Code rather than a charter) doesn't report on any of the election campaigns from 00:30 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. Coverage on the day is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations or the weather.Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself, so the BBC's output cannot be seen to be influencing the ballot while the polls are open. No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed.Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election."

2016-05-05,Ministers in battle over Housing Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36201892,"The government remains in a race against time to get its promise to build 200,000 starter homes into law. Peers continue to defy ministers over its Housing Bill, voting to reinstate a number of measures rejected by MPs.They backed calls to give councils more room to consider alternative sources of affordable housing while allowing them to keep part of the money when they sell off high value homes.Ministers have made several concessions after suffering 18 defeats on the bill.The bill is ""ping-ponging"" between the two houses - with the government desperate to get it into law before the end of the current parliamentary session next week.If it fails to do so, it could see its manifesto commitment to building hundreds of thousands of ""starter homes"" in England and Wales delayed.MPs voted on Tuesday to reject 13 amendments to the Housing Bill demanded by the House of Lords. They backed higher rents for people with a household income of £31,000 or more (£40,000 in London) and plans to make councils sell ""high value"" homes to pay off the deficit.It was thought the Lords would have to water down some of its amendments after Housing Minister Brandon Lewis declared them budgetary measures, meaning the House of Commons has the final say on them.But the peers stood firm when the bill returned to the Lords on Wednesday, inflicting five defeats and forcing ministers to adjust their plans to push up rents for ""high income"" tenants of social housing in England.The Lords had voted to soften the impact of so-called ""pay to stay"" plans, which would see council tenants in England paying higher rents. Ministers have now said the minimum income threshold at which tenants would find themselves liable - £31,000 outside London and £40,000 in the capital - would only rise in line with inflation every year while the increases would come into force more gradually, with a taper rate of 15% rather than 20%.Speaking on Tuesday, Lyn Brown, Labour MP for West Ham, backed the Lords amendment, telling MPs: ""This is a tax on aspiration, and the idea that a family in London that earns £40,000 a year is rich is baloney. ""It costs an awful lot to live in this wonderful capital city of ours - something that the minister is failing to grasp.""'Damaging plans'The Lords also wanted guarantees high value properties sold off by councils to fund the government's plans to extend ""right to buy"" to housing association tenants in England would be replaced by similar homes in the same area, amid fears long-standing residents would be driven out of their home areas.The Lords may now have to water this amendment down after it was rejected by MPs in Tuesday night's vote.Mr Lewis said the government had made some concessions to the demands, but he accused peers of wanting to ""wreck"" the bill, which includes plans for more ""starter homes"".He told MPs: ""We are determined to deliver for Britain on our election promises. ""The manifesto on which this government was elected set out a very clear statement of intent about a viable extension of the right to buy, paid for by the sale of higher-value housing, and about 200,000 starter homes by the end of this Parliament.""Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""The Housing Bill will mean the loss of thousands of affordable homes while doing nothing to fix the causes of the last six years of failure on housing. ""Ministers showed yesterday that they still have no answers to concerns from housing experts, campaigners, MPs and peers.""He added: ""If ministers want to fix the housing crisis then they need to listen to the opposition coming from all sides and rethink their damaging plans."""
2016-05-05,"Turkey not joining EU soon, Cameron says",https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36205844,"Concerns over Turkey potentially joining the EU should not influence voters in the UK's forthcoming referendum, the PM has said.David Cameron said Turkey joining the 28-member bloc was ""not remotely on the cards"" and would take ""decades"".Turkey is currently in long-running negotiations for accession to the EU.Meanwhile, a Tory MP has threatened the PM with legal action if he does not remove pages from the government's main website arguing for EU membership.The prime minister made his comments about Turkey just hours after the European Commission gave its conditional backing for Turkish people to get visa-free travel inside Europe's passport-free Schengen area - which does not include the UK.The deal was offered in return for Turkey - which has a population of 80 million - taking back migrants who crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece, but it has sparked claims the country is on its way to full EU membership.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.However, Mr Cameron told the House of Commons Liaison Committee: ""I will be absolutely frank with you, I don't think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don't think it will happen for decades.""If you look at the facts, the facts are that it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they'd have a referendum on it.""I would say very clearly to people, if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don't think about it. It's not remotely on the cards. It's not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn't be.""He also told the committee:Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said the prime minister could ""expect a writ"" if pro-EU pages were kept on gov.uk in the four weeks leading up to the vote on 23 June.The home page of gov.uk website, which sets out details of government information and services, contains a hard link to a government website setting out the benefits of the EU membership.Mr Jenkin, a prominent Leave campaigner, said the government intended to keep all the pro-Remain pages on the gov.uk website during the 28-day ""purdah period"" leading up to the EU vote.Mr Jenkin said he had been told keeping the pages would contravene the Political Parties and Referendum Act, which governs the conduct of referendums in the UK. Mr Cameron said the government would be taking its own legal advice, adding:  ""It seems to me the right thing to do is to make sure that if there is a government website, it is not refreshed or updated during the purdah period.""But I would ask whether it was absolutely necessary to take something down. That would seem a rather extreme position."""

The UK currently takes children from refugee camps in Syria and its neighbours but there has been pressure to take some who are already in the EU.Labour said the announcement, made at Prime Minister's Questions, did not go far enough and more action was needed.The government agreed in January to take some lone child refugees directly from North Africa and Middle East - but rejected calls to accept 3,000 children who had made it to Europe because it did not want to encourage others to make the ""lethal"" journey.Now, in a change of heart, children registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March - when the EU struck its refugee deal with Turkey - will be eligible for resettlement in the UK.The government said the retrospective nature of the scheme would avoid creating a ""perverse incentive"" for families to entrust their children to people traffickers. It would mean the UK can focus on the ""most vulnerable children already in Europe without encouraging more to make the journey"", Downing Street said.Mr Cameron, who has been facing the threat of a Conservative backbench rebellion in a vote next week over the issue, said he had accepted a revised amendment to the Immigration Bill put forward by Labour peer Lord Dubs.He told MPs: ""I am also talking to Save the Children to see what we can do more, particularly about children who came here before the EU-Turkey deal was signed.""What I don't want us to do is to take steps that will encourage people to make this dangerous journey because otherwise our actions, however well-meaning they will be, could result in more people dying than more people getting a good life.""Ministers get irritated when critics suggest the government's not done enough to help Syrian refugees. They point to the thousands already promised help through resettlement programmes and billions of pounds of aid from the UK. But a majority of MPs demanded more action to help unaccompanied children.   David Cameron has always insisted that nothing must be done to encourage refugees to make the dangerous journey to Europe so now ministers have found a compromise. It's a political solution to avoid a defeat in the Commons but Tory MPs and several charities have called it ""tremendous"".      The implementation of the programme now depends on local authorities who have to make sure they have the funding, school places and social service support that many of these traumatised children will require. Downing Street hasn't put a figure on how many might be helped, but the expectation is that it will be thousands and Conservative MPs have promised to keep up the campaigning.         There does remain some concern though, that what's been announced won't help the most vulnerable, who might not have registered and who've disappeared from the system altogether. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, who pressed Mr Cameron on the issue, said he welcomed what he said appeared to be the ""beginning of a U-turn"".Mr Cameron has been under pressure to accept 3,000 child refugees who have made it into Europe unaccompanied.But the government says the number will depend on what councils can cope with.Funding will be made available from central government for those councils willing to take in unaccompanied child migrants, said a source.Immigration minister James Brokenshire told a meeting of Conservative MPs he was going to write to all local councils and ask them to gauge capacity - but warn them they should expect at least as many unaccompanied children as the UK took last year.Local authorities will be expected to share responsibility because some had been overburdened, he told the MPs.The Local Government Association said councils were ready to ""play their part"" but wanted more clarity on long-term funding and how the national dispersal mechanism will work. Save the Children said Mr Cameron had ""offered a lifeline to these vulnerable children,"" adding: ""This announcement echoes Britain's proud history of offering safety at times of great crisis and we want to thank the members of parliament who have led the way in championing this cause, as well as the British public who have opened their hearts to refugee children.""Conservative MP Heidi Allen - who had said she was prepared to vote against the government and support an amendment calling on the government to accept more unaccompanied children -  described the announcement as ""tremendous news"".But a spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Cameron had not gone far enough - and they wanted to see ""greater action and more generosity"".Labour MP Yvette Coooper, who chairs the party's refugee taskforce, said more detail was needed about what Mr Cameron is planning.""He was wrong to claim last week that child refugees alone in Europe don't need help, so I hope he will be clear about that now and set out what the government will do next,"" she said.In a letter to David Cameron, Sir Erich Reich, chairman of Kindertransport-Association of Jewish Refugees, had called on the PM to do more to help ""the most vulnerable victims"" of the Syrian conflict.He said it was ""incumbent on us to provide sanctuary to those in need"". Mr Cameron rejected comparisons with the ""Kindertransport"" scheme that helped Jewish children escape from the Nazis, at Prime Minister's Questions.""To say that the Kindertransport is taking today children from France or Germany or Italy, safe countries that are democracies, I think that is an insult to those countries,"" he told MPs.But he added: ""We're going to go round the local authorities and see what more we can do, but let's stick to the principle we should not be taking in new arrivals to Europe.""In September 2015 the government said the UK would accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years. And last month the government said it would accept up to 3,000 more refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the Middle East and North Africa by 2020.In his letter, Sir Erich, who was among thousands of Jewish children rescued from Nazi Germany, said he had learned of the rejection of the resettlement proposal ""with great sadness"".He added: ""I strongly urge you and your colleagues to reconsider how we can intervene to help some of the most vulnerable victims of an internecine conflict that has claimed the lives of thousands of people and displaced millions.""The echoes of the past haunt many of my fellow Kinder and I whose fate similarly rested with members of the British parliament.""I feel it is incumbent on us to once again demonstrate our compassion and human-kindness to provide sanctuary to those in need."""
2016-05-05,Scargill calls for Orgreave inquiry,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-36199621,"Former miners' union president Arthur Scargill has called for an inquiry into the 1984 Battle of Orgreave disorder.Thousands of miners and police clashed at the South Yorkshire coking plant.A redacted version of an IPCC report into police conduct was published last year, with the police watchdog now considering releasing a full copy.The Yorkshire Post reported the redacted sections show the same senior officers were involved both in the aftermath of Orgreave and Hillsborough.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Scargill, who led the National Union of Mineworkers during the 1984-85 miners' strike, said: ""I want to see a full open public inquiry and the individuals responsible should be named.""I accuse those individuals now.""What was the 'Battle of Orgreave'?Mr Scargill, 78, said the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the late Conservative politician Sir Leon Brittan, the government at large and various police forces were to blame for the ""bloodshed"".A South Yorkshire Police (SYP) spokesman said: ""SYP is aware of the campaign for a public inquiry, however it is a matter for the Home Secretary and Home Office.""  Mr Scargill claims there were similarities between the way police acted in the aftermath of Orgreave and events following the Hillsborough disaster.  He said: ""A full inquiry will reveal that they concocted stories, they told lies.""For example, they said when I was knocked unconscious that I slipped on a grassy bank. When a photograph was produced it showed I'd been hit by a policeman's short shield.""The so-called Battle of Orgreave saw thousands of pickets confront huge lines of police outside the coke works near Rotherham. Miners wanted to stop lorry loads of coke leaving for the steel works, with police holding them back.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was currently examining whether there were any remaining legal issues preventing the full publication of its report.A spokeswoman for the police watchdog said the 2015 report had been redacted as a result of legal matters, including some relating to the Hillsborough inquests, which concluded last month.She said: ""We are now considering whether the legal issues that prompted the report being redacted still remain.""One key consideration is that the IPCC and Operation Resolve are conducting criminal investigations into the events at Hillsborough and its aftermath.""As a result we must now carefully consider whether we can publish an unredacted version of the report at this stage without compromising the integrity of the ongoing criminal investigations.""Operation Resolve is the continuing police inquiry into the events of the day of the Hillsborough disaster and its lead-up.In 2015, the IPCC said the passage of time meant allegations of assault and misconduct at Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham ""could not be pursued"".Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said the IPCC report contained proof ""underhand tactics were used first against South Yorkshire miners before being deployed to much more deadly effect against Liverpool supporters [at Hillsborough]"".He said: ""As I've always said, we won't have the truth about Hillsborough until we have the full truth about Orgreave.""Campaigners have called on Dave Jones, the new interim chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, to open up the force's archives on Orgreave.The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said they want Mr Jones to intervene in their legal bid to push Home Secretary Theresa May to hold a public inquiry.Louise Haigh, Labour MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: ""It's really important that these documents are made public and the Home Secretary can then commission a full public inquiry just as she did with Hillsborough.""These documents are only the starting point of that.""

2016-05-05,EU exit 'could take years to complete',https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36195499,"Leaving the EU would mean ""difficult and lengthy negotiations"" that could take years to complete, peers say.The Lords EU Committee said determining the rights of two million UK nationals living in the EU would be a ""complex and daunting"" part of exit talks. While they do not recommend a vote either way, peers say trade deals between the EU and non-EU states take between four and nine years on average. Leave campaigners argue a UK-EU Treaty should be wrapped up in two years.A separate report from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, also published on Wednesday, suggests curbs on in-work benefits for EU citizens negotiated by David Cameron are unlikely to result in a large reduction in migration to the UK.It said a ""large majority"" of recent EU migrants were not claiming benefits of any kind.If the UK voted to leave in the referendum on 23 June, it would not mean an immediate exit from the EU. This issue covers travel for leisure or work, and living in other EU countries.The prime minister could trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides for a two-year process for negotiating the terms of withdrawal and a departing state's future relations with the EU.But there is some debate as to whether this is the best method for leaving the EU and whether it should happen immediately after the vote.The cross-party committee warned that negotiations for withdrawal and to establish a new relationship with the EU would take longer than the two years allowed under Article 50.The committee, which took evidence from two EU law experts, said one of the most complex parts of the talks would be establishing the rights of UK citizens resident in other member states to access health care, schooling and employment.The negotiations, it added, would also have to deal with the reciprocal rights of EU nationals living in the UK.""We don't take a view on whether the UK should leave the EU or not,"" said Lord Boswell, the former Conservative minister who chairs the committee.""But it is clear that if that's what people decide, withdrawal would mean difficult and lengthy negotiations.""""It's not possible to predict exactly how long it would take, but comparable international trade deals have taken on average between four and nine years.""Peers also say the process of reviewing and disentangling the UK from EU law would take years to complete - with the government having to assess which laws it wished to keep.Vote Leave, the official group campaigning for an EU exit, said the UK faced a choice between ""handing more money and power to Brussels or to take back control"".""It [the report] also torpedoes the claims that the EU wouldn't do a trade deal with us after we vote leave - it's in everyone's interest on all sides to strike a deal after the UK takes back the power over trade.""UKIP said the committee was made up of Europhiles and its findings were ""partial nonsense"". Remain campaigners argue there is no guarantee that expats living in the EU would be able to stay in the event of Brexit."
2016-05-05,EU upholds tough rules on tobacco packs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36200778,"Rules that will drastically alter cigarette packaging are set to be adopted, after big tobacco firms failed to block new European Union laws.Europe's highest court upheld a law that will standardise packaging and ban the advertising of e-cigarettes.The Court of Justice found the laws ""did not go beyond the limits of what is appropriate and necessary"".Under the new rules health warnings will have to cover 65% of the front and back of cigarette packaging.The rules are due to take effect from 20 May, but the new packets will not be on sale until stocks of existing cartons have been cleared over the next year.Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco (BAT) challenged the proposed legislation.They argued that the European Union was overstepping its authority to direct laws in member states.Reacting to the court's findings a BAT spokesperson said: ""We stand by our belief that the Tobacco Products Directive is a clear example of the EU overstepping the limits of its authority. The reality is that many elements of the directive are disproportionate, distort competition, and fail to respect the autonomy of the Member States."" Individual EU states are also working on new packaging rules.In the UK, the government wants to introduce tobacco packs with plain packaging - a move which is also being challenged by big tobacco companies.The law was supposed to come into effect later this month, but that could be delayed as on 18 May the High Court is due to rule on the legal challenge to the legislation from the tobacco industry.""What is clear from the [EU] directive and the judgment is that measures that go beyond the requirements of the directive, such as plain packaging, must still comply with the wider principles of EU and international law."" said the BAT spokesperson.""Whether plain packaging meets these requirements is currently the subject of ongoing litigation before the English Courts and the WTO [World Trade Organization].It is likely that the losing party would launch an appeal over the High Court's decision."
2016-05-05,Call to stop council tax bailiffs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36193490,"Vulnerable residents with council tax debts should be given breathing space to repay arrears rather than face the threat of bailiffs, two charities say.Debt charities StepChange and the Money Advice Trust have reported rising levels of council tax debt.They argue that increased use of bailiffs by councils could deepen these residents' financial problems.The Local Government Association (LGA) said that bailiffs were only used as a last resort.The LGA said that cuts to local government funding meant that some people who had previously been exempt from paying council tax were now having to pay.""Significant cuts mean many [councils] have had little choice but to reduce council tax discounts for the working-age poor or low-income families...to avoid finding even more savings from spending on local services to meet the shortfall,"" said councillor Claire Kober, of the LGA.The two charities say about a quarter of callers to their debt services have council tax arrears.StepChange said that its clients were typically in arrears by £961 last year, up from £717 in 2011. There was a slight fall in arrears in 2013, but otherwise there had been a sharp rise each year between 2011 and 2015.The charities argue that the threat of bailiffs causes extra stress and anxiety to those in debt, so there should be a delay before these collection agencies are called in.""It may come as a surprise to people that public bodies are more aggressive in pursuing debts than many private companies,"" said Mike O'Connor, chief executive of StepChange.""This counterproductive approach needs to stop immediately and be replaced with one that is fairer and more constructive.""Some councils rule out bailiff action against anyone who receives council tax support - as they are already considered to be financially vulnerable. Such a policy should be adopted nationwide, the charities said.They also want a statutory breathing space scheme that guarantees anyone seeking debt advice is given a temporary freeze on debt interest and charges, and that any enforcement action is halted.  The LGA argued that giving people more time to pay could have unintended consequences.""We agree that bailiffs should only ever be used as a last resort. Before the situation reaches a stage where bailiffs are involved several letters should have been written, people should have been encouraged to apply for financial support, and efforts should be made to arrange new payment plans or to attach the debt to a salary,"" said the LGA's Ms Kober.""It is in everyone's interest to ensure those struggling to pay their council tax bills are set up on affordable and sustainable payment plans. However, there is always a risk that the longer a debtor goes on without paying, their repayment instalments will become even more difficult for them to manage and the debt will take longer to clear.""With 97% of council tax collected without the need for bailiffs or court action, the Department for Communities and Local Government said that the vast majority of residents paid on time.""We have also made it easier for households to pay their bills in monthly instalments and published guidance to stop bad practices from aggressive bailiffs,"" a spokesman for the DCLG said.""However, every penny of council tax that is not collected means a higher bill for everyone in the area so we expect councils to be sympathetic to those in genuine hardship, but take appropriate action to chase up outstanding debts, while delivering a fair deal for local families."""
2016-05-05,EU sets out road to Turkey visa deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36199811,"The European Commission has given conditional backing for Turkish people to get visa-free travel inside Europe's passport-free Schengen area.It says Turkey has made good progress on key conditions, but work remains to be done ""as a matter of urgency"".The change could take effect from July, but first it requires approval by the European Parliament and member states.The deal was offered in return for Turkey taking back migrants who crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece.The EU fears that without it, Turkey will not control migration.The Turkish foreign minister,  Mevlut Cavusoglu, welcomed the recommendation, saying the visa proposals have opened a new page in Turkey's relations with the EU.What is the Schengen agreement?Turks look to EU to scrap visasThe visa liberalisation deal remains controversial in a number of capitals across the EU, but the Commission praised Turkey for its progress in fulfilling its requirements, particularly in recent weeks.Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: ""There is still work to be done as a matter of urgency, but if Turkey sustains the progress made, they can meet the remaining benchmarks.""  The Commission outlined several outstanding issues, with Turkey required to do more to tackle corruption and bring its laws on terrorism in line with European standards, among others.Full European Commission StatementThe commission is also giving Turkey until the end of the year to upgrade its passports, so that they meet the latest biometric standards. Mr Timmermans stressed that no Turkish citizen would enter the EU without a visa if they do not have a biometric passport with a facial image and fingerprint data. He said: ""I would rather have somebody at my border with a biometric passport where I can be sure that the person carrying the passport is actually mentioned in the passport, than a person with an old-fashioned passport and a paper visa.""The deal will scrap the requirement for Turks to get a three-month, short-stay Schengen visa for tourism or business trips. Visa-free travel will apply to all EU Member States except for Ireland and the UK, and to the four Schengen associated countries - Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.But it will not grant Turks the right to get a job in Europe. Separate to the deal with Turkey, the Commission also proposed granting visa-free travel to citizens of Kosovo. The tiny Balkan state declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and is still not recognised by Belgrade and five EU states. Under the plan, Kosovans with biometric passports would be able to enter the Schengen zone without a visa and stay for up to 90 days.Turkey has threatened to stop taking back migrants from Greece if the EU fails to deliver on visa liberalisation.The large influx of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe from Turkey, and from North Africa, has caused a political crisis among EU states.Under the EU-Turkey agreement, migrants who have arrived illegally in Greece since 20 March are to be sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or if their claim is rejected.For each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey, the EU is to take in another Syrian who has made a legitimate request.78.7mPopulation11.1% Unemployment 2.75m Syrian refugees registered with UN 151 out of 180 countries on World Press Freedom Index The deal will now be sent to the European Parliament, which has already said it will not vote on the proposal until the Commission confirms all of the conditions have been met.  Concerns have been raised in Parliament before that the visa-waiver looks like a reward for Turkey, because of its co-operation in the migrant crisis. It says Ankara falls short of many EU human rights benchmarks.MEPs accept that Turkey is a ""key strategic partner"" for the EU. But they say reforms have slowed down in Turkey in many areas, including freedom of speech and judicial independence. MEPs have also voiced concern about continuing fighting in south-eastern Turkey between government troops and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels, whom the government in Ankara describes as ""terrorists"". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
2016-05-05,Quarter of UK care homes 'risk closure',https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36200855,"More than a quarter of care homes in the UK are in danger of going out of business within three years, figures obtained by BBC Radio Four suggest. About 5,000 homes are at risk of closure because they carry too much debt and do not make enough profit to cover loan repayments.On average, care homes make £17,647 in profit before tax, the research found. The Department of Health said it was working to make sure care providers had ""strong contingency plans"".The research, carried out for Radio 4's You and Yours programme by business risk analysts, found individual care homes were borrowing about 61% of the value of the business on average - a figure that amounted to £4bn across the industry. There are 20,000 care homes in the UK, which are operated by 5,871 individual owners who make, on average, about £60,000 profit as operators. Business risk adviser Nick Hood, from Opus Business Services, said the figures made investment difficult.  He added: ""It leaves a very small pot to encourage people to stay in this market and run care homes and to invest in them and to create the extra capacity that we all know this market is going to need as the baby boomers get old and need to go into care."" Much of the funding for care homes comes from private equity firms and US real estate companies, but You and Yours reporter Samantha Fenwick - who looked at the issue for the programme - said there was concern these investors would want big and quick returns on their investments.She said the profitability of care homes had also been hit by rising costs, including the new national living wage of £7.20.John Strowbridge, managing director of Avery Health Care Group, which operates 47 care homes across England, said the new living wage was costing it an additional £2m a year. He also said the fees provided to operators to care for local authority residents were often not enough to match care costs.  Mr Strowbridge added: ""And if it continues, as it will do with the national living wage into next year and the year after, the number of local authority clients that care homes can admit across the country, not just Northamptonshire, will continue to be reduced in everybody's care homes, because you just cannot afford to take local authority clients anymore.""  Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents care providers, said: ""What we're actually finding is we are in that very difficult situation where responsible providers are going to think to themselves, 'I can't do this very well, I may as well come out of it' and I think that's the worry that we have.""  The Department of Health said it recognised some care providers were ""finding the current market challenging"".A spokeswoman said: ""No-one will be left without care if a home closes. ""Following the failure of Southern Cross, we empowered the Care Quality Commission [independent regulator for England] to monitor the finances of the largest care providers and to provide early warning of likely insolvencies so we can better protect vulnerable people who use their services.""There will be more on this story on You and Yours at 12:15 BST on Wednesday on BBC Radio Four."
2016-05-05,A guide to 2016's elections,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35813119,"Britain goes to the polls in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years. They are quite separate from the EU referendum, which is due to take place on 23 June.Here is a rundown of the elections taking place on 5 May:Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area.Polls close at 22:00. After that, counting begins, with the results coming in at different points over the next 24 hours.Watch: Which seats are up for grabs?In London, counting the votes will begin the day after polling day, with the new mayor expected to be announced from mid afternoon. Votes cast for the London Assembly will also be counted on Friday.Declarations in Scotland and Wales are expected overnight on Thursday, and during Friday in Northern Ireland.Where to watch the results on the BBCAn election special, presented by Huw Edwards, starts at 23:45 on BBC One, after Question Time, with coverage throughout the night as results come in. On BBC Radio 5 Live, Jim Naughtie and Anna Foster present an election special from 00:30.All the latest developments are on the BBC politics website, with rolling updates on the Election Live page.Until polls close, we are limited in what we report.There are also dedicated programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Anyone 18 or over on 5 May who is a British citizen living in the UK, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, or an EU citizen living in the UK, can vote in the English, Welsh, London or Northern Irish contests.  In Scotland, 16 and 17-year-olds are also eligible to vote.If you have received a polling card through the post then you are registered to vote. If not, you may need to check with your local authority that you are still on the electoral register, particularly if you have moved house recently. The deadline to register was Monday, 18 April.Most people vote in person at a polling station on the day. It is normally a local school or community centre - the location will be on your polling card. You do not need to take the polling card with you in order to vote. A member of staff will give you a ballot paper with a list of candidates and parties on it. Put a cross in the box next to the ones you want to vote for. The deadline to apply to vote by post has now passed. If you have already applied, ballot papers should be completed and returned, ensuring you leave enough time for them to arrive by 10:00 on 5 May.

Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up. SNP - 69 seatsLabour - 37Conservative - 15Lib Dems - 5Greens - 2What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.WalesWhat happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.Labour - 30 seatsConservative - 14Plaid Cymru - 11Lib Dem - 5What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game. What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.DUP - 38 seatsSinn Fein - 29UUP - 16SDLP - 14Alliance - 8Others - 3What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.Assembly seats after 2012 electionLabour - 12 seatsConservative - 9Green - 2 Lib Dem - 2 What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives.  The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance. The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 ""omnishambles"" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England. All seats are up for grabs in three councils: Sheffield, Knowsley and RotherhamMetropolitan boroughs: A third of council seats are up for election in 32 of 36 Metropolitan boroughs including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sunderland.

Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May. What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.To find out more about these elections you can visit the Electoral Commission's About My Vote website."

2016-05-05,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-05,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.

Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post.

He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-05,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36195593,"The claim: Leaving the EU would put £250bn of trade at risk, according to Britain Stronger in Europe.Reality Check verdict: The group has taken a set of figures predicting the benefits of EU membership and used that to reach a figure for the risks of leaving. It would not necessarily work like that. Also, the figures include imports, a fall in which would not necessarily be a bad thing.Britain Stronger in Europe (BSIE) says £250bn of trade would be at risk if the UK were to leave the European Union.In a press release announcing the number, former Chancellor Alistair Darling said: ""Those wanting to leave the EU want to pull Britain out of the single market, which would mean introducing tariffs and barriers to our trade and putting billions of vital trade at risk.""The figure is based on part of the Treasury's work on the impact of a Brexit.The Treasury compared the amount of trade done between EU members with the amount done by non-members.That's a tricky thing to do. While the method chosen is reasonable, the conclusions should not be seen as precise.Its analysis concluded trade with EU countries was 76% higher as a result of Britain being in the EU than it would be if Britain were not. It also identified smaller benefits coming from membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), and from other free trade agreements negotiated by the EU. For the EEA it was 44%, and for the other free trade agreements it was 17%.BSIE has taken those Treasury figures for gains from EU membership, reversed them, and used them to conclude £250bn of trade would be at risk if the UK were to leave the EU.But looking at how much trade is increased by signing a free trade agreement is not the same as predicting that amount would be at risk from leaving. The effect of leaving may or may not be the reverse of the effect of joining - there are no examples of countries leaving the EU that could form the basis for the research.To reach the £250bn figure, BSIE has started with the total amount of trade the UK did with the EU in 2014, which was about £520bn.Remember, that's a figure for both exports and imports.But some might think a reduction in imports could be a good thing, helping reduce the country's trade deficit.If you assume leaving the EU would have the exact reverse effect of joining, then a 76% increase equates to a 43% fall (imagine you were doing £100 of trade - if it increased by 76%, there would be £176 - you would have to reduce it by 43% to get back to £100). So, you take 43% off EU trade, a loss of £224bn. Similarly, you take 31% (that's the reverse of the 44%) off the £29bn of EEA trade, a loss of £9bn. These are the figures BSIE reaches. Its figure for the trade with countries with which the EU has other free trade agreements, however, looks a bit off.The Treasury says trade with these countries has been increased by 17% as a result of EU membership. To reverse a 17% rise, you would need a 14.5% fall.BSIE says the UK did £62bn of such trade in 2014.And losing 14.5% of that would be a loss of £9bn, not the £14bn claimed by BSIE.So, the total comes to £243bn, not the £247bn suggested by BSIE.But splitting hairs about £4bn or £5bn here and there may be flattering the accuracy of the prediction.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-05,Six reasons,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36202424,"Donald Trump is now close to being assured the Republican nomination in the US presidential race, something few would have predicted 12 months ago.The Democratic race is still going, but it looks increasingly likely that Hillary Clinton will be the nominee, despite Vermont senator Bernie Sanders' win in Indiana on Tuesday.The picture has now become clear enough that we know that whatever happens, the outcome will be historic. This is how.When Barack Obama first walked through the White House front door back in January 2009, he was aged 47, and was the fifth-youngest president in history. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest, at 42 years and 322 days.The next one will be a fair bit older, whatever happens.Bernie Sanders will be 75 on inauguration day on 20 January, almost six years older than the oldest president on inauguration, Ronald Reagan.Donald Trump celebrates his 70th birthday on 14 June, so he too would be the oldest president in history.Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, turns 69 some two weeks before the election, and would become the second-oldest president on inauguration. She would replace William Henry Harrison, who became president in 1841 (and was the last president born on British soil).Both scenarios - Trump v Clinton or Trump v Sanders - will see the first presidential contest between New Yorkers since 1944, when the governor of New York, Thomas E Dewey, ran against the incumbent, Franklin D Roosevelt.Whoever wins this time will become the first New Yorker in office in 71 years when the inauguration takes place next year.(And yes, we know Mrs Clinton was born in Chicago, but she was a senator from New York and lives in the state).If Mr Trump wins, we could be looking at the least amount of money spent by a winning candidate for some time.Federal Election Commission records show he spent $49m (£34m) up to the end of March, of which $36m is his own money.No other candidate since Al Gore in 2000 ($126m) has spent as little. Hillary Clinton is on some $187m so far, by the way.Of course, Mr Trump could break out the chequebook given that he has more campaigning to do between now and November, but it looks likely he will come a long way under what Barack Obama spent last time round - almost $556m.A Trump win would be significant for another reason - no-one has been elected president in more than 60 years without experience as a governor or in Congress.Even then, the last president with no political experience, Dwight Eisenhower, was Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War Two, before he was elected to office in 1953.Before that, Herbert Hoover, who was president from 1929 to 1933, was previously an engineer and humanitarian.No previous candidate has ever owned a chain of casinos and hotels. But Mr Trump says his experience doing deals, and the fact he is not too tied to the Washington establishment, stand him in good stead.The long years Hillary Clinton has been on the Washington scene may make it easy to forget one fact: she would be the first female president if elected.The closest we have got before is when Republican John McCain surprisingly picked Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008, and when Democrat Walter Mondale named Geraldine Ferraro as his vice-presidential pick in 1984.Neither won the presidency.Amazingly, only two Democrats have directly succeeded another Democrat as US president. The most recent was James Buchanan, who was president from 1857 to 1861. Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson were both vice-presidents who were named president when their predecessors died. They both then went on to win the next election.A Clinton win, therefore, would bring even more significance to the Democratic Party. This is how polls have changed over the past 10 months between the two frontrunners. Now there's only six months to go."
2016-05-05,What's the plan?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36203410,"In the last couple of days David Cameron has been under more and more pressure to change his mind and allow more child refugees, on their own and vulnerable in continental Europe, to come to the UK. And despite his refusal to budge just seven days ago, budge he has. But the plans the government is putting in place are not crystal clear. So what do we know about the ""plans"" and what details are still missing? Since September charities and some MPs have been calling on the government to offer homes in Britain to some of the thousands of child refugees who have already made it to mainland Europe. The government has continually said no.Ministers have been firm for months on the principle that it is far better to help those caught up in the migrant crisis in the region - in the camps and temporary accommodation in the Middle East and Africa than help those who are, they argue, in relative safety in European countries like Italy, France or Greece.The prime minister and his team have gone on the record on countless occasions making that case, and pointing out that the UK has been a far more effective and generous donor to the aid efforts in the region than any other European country. That's now changed. Downing Street diplomatically calls their new strategy a ""twin track"" - in other words, Number 10 has given way on a long held principle. Children who have made their way alone to Europe as migrants and who arrived in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March will now be eligible to come to the UK.Those who are selected, probably by aid workers on the ground in those countries, will be given five year residence permits for the UK, what was described to me as ""humanitarian visas"". What we also know is that the government was likely to lose the vote on this in the Commons next week. With the referendum campaign making everything tense, Number 10 was evidently just not willing to let that happen. But much about the plan is not yet clear. One source familiar with the conversations told me ""there have been five different positions in the last 36 hours"".Most crucially, what we do not yet know is how many children will be eligible, and how many will actually come. Discussions will now take place between the government and local councils over how many children on their own they could accommodate.  There is of course already considerable strain on resources in local authorities right across the countryWhat we also don't know is if there will be any extra cash available for councils who say they will take some in. But one source close to the negotiations told, ""if this is done properly it will mean thousands"". Finally, what is impossible to predict is what effect this will have on the ""pull factor"" - the concern ministers always voiced, that allowing more refugees to come to Britain once they were already in Europe would only encourage more to make the dangerous journey across the sea. But now the prime minister has ditched his principle and promised to open the door, campaigners, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and their own backbenchers will be pushing to make sure he does. "

Why are people turning their back on local elections and how can they be drawn back to the ballot box?There were 41 out of about 2,500 wards in England where not even a fifth of the electorate turned out to choose a local councillor in 2012. This was the last time the seats being contested on 5 May this year were elected.The Electoral Reform Society said this amounted to ""serious democratic deficit"" and it is vital people vote and hold authorities to account.So how does the country solve a problem like low turnout? BBC News looks at some of the options.Online voting would improve turn out, according to market research conducted among 2,000 non-voters before the 2015 General Election.""We found two thirds of those who did not vote in 2010 said online voting would make them 'more likely' to vote,"" said Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of the research company Survation.""Improving access in this way might be particularly important for the 9% of non-voters who said they were 'not able to access a polling station or get a postal ballot'.""A commission set up by the Commons Speaker John Bercow said that by 2020 ""secure online voting should be an option for all voters"".Electronic voting is used in Estonia, where about 30% of participants cast their ballot online. So-called e-voting in the country has grown in popularity, from 30,275 users in the 2007 parliament elections to 176,491 people in 2015, while overall turnout has risen from 61.9% to 64.2%.However, the Estonian government says research suggests it did not play a great role in getting more people to vote.Arne Koitmäe, an adviser in the elections department of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu, said: ""[Researchers] found that while the aggregate turnout did increase marginally, they cannot really claim that this was only down to e-voting as such. ""Their conclusion was that e-voting simply makes voting easier but it doesn't address the underlining causes of turnout decline and it will not necessarily engage those for whom the problem lies in politics as such.""In Australia, non-voters face fines of $20 (about £11), rising to $170 (about £93) plus costs if they fail to pay.  In the 2013 General Election, turnout was more than 93%, compared with 66.1% in the UK in 2015. However, Australian voters spoiled 5.9% of ballot papers, while the UK electorate spoiled just 0.2%.Labour MP David Winnick tried to make voting a ""civic obligation"" in the UK via a Private Member's Bill, but it never made it beyond the Commons.But the Civitas think tank is concerned it might turn voting into ""one more thing that the state requires us to do, like filling in a tax form or taking the car for its MOT"".93%Turnout in Australia$20Fine for not voting1924 was when Australia introduced the legal duty to vote 14 countries enforce participation 17 countries say voting is compulsory but it is not enforced And Dr Annabelle Lever, a former fellow at the London School of Economics, has argued compulsory voting could see people without strong views coerced into voting a certain way by others.Writing in the journal Public Reason she said: ""Most protest, and all voting, depends for its success on the behaviour of other people, many of whom we will not know, many of whom will have interests and beliefs quite at odds with our own, and over whose behaviour we have no influence. ""People must, therefore, have rights to limit their participation in politics and, at the limit, to abstain.""The council ward with the lowest average turnout in 2012 was Liverpool Central, according to data from the Electoral Commission.The city council blames the low turnout on ""voter apathy"" for local elections among the large number of students registered in the ward. The ward saw a big rise in turnout in 2015 when the council elections coincided with the General Election.Ellie Hughes, who stood as a prospective councillor in Manchester in 2014 when she was an 18-year-old student, said she had tried to encourage friends to vote but ""a lot of people didn't even know there was a council election"".However, impartial campaign group Bite The Ballot, which encourages young people to vote, says that far from ""apathy"", many students feel councils do not want to consult with them.Campaigns manager Abiodun Michael Olatokun said: ""Young people are not apathetic. They do care deeply about the area they live in, about the standard of housing, the number of police officers and so on. Local democracy needs to be repurposed and made more accessible, with more online consultation and more use of social media.""Members of BBC Generation 2016, hand-picked to represent a broad cross-section of young people in the UK, agreed there was an issue with student engagement. They said this may be due to them being more interested in their home town than their place of study.Takyiwa Danso, 23, from London, said: ""You're kind of like a nomad, you don't really see yourself in one place. You probably care about where you're actually from.""Work to try to get more young people to vote in the council elections on 5 May has included writing to tenants of halls of residence to remind them.The Electoral Commission says students are difficult to keep track of on the electoral register because they might be on it at their parents' home, but not at their term time address. It also found similar difficulties among young private renters. MPs and English councillors are elected by the ""first past the post"" system. The candidate with the most votes wins.Katie Ghose, chief executive of The Electoral Reform Society, says countries with proportional representation typically have higher turnouts ""as people feel their votes actually count"".It suggests moving to proportional representation, such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in local government elections in Northern Ireland and Scotland. STV involves ranking candidates in order of preference.On its website, the society also lists the disadvantages of STV, saying the count takes longer, can lead to larger constituencies and result in people voting for the candidates ""in the order they appear on the ballot"".In 2011 a referendum on changing the voting system for MPs to the ""alternative vote"" saw 68% of voters say no. Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned against it, said at the time: ""It can mean someone who's not really wanted by anyone winning an election because they were the least unliked.""Elections for police and crime commissioners use the ""supplementary vote"" system if there are more than two candidates. Voters choose a first and second preference.However, when the positions were first elected in 2012, national turnout was a record low at fewer than 15%. Lack of awareness about the elections was the most common reason given.When Survation asked 2,096 non-voters what would persuade them to cast a ballot, the most popular answer - at 39% was  ""other"".Mr Lyons Lowe said: ""Our major study of non-voters revealed that in most cases, non-voters have the same concerns about political issues that voters have - creating a stable economy, promoting jobs, reducing poverty, reforming welfare and protecting the NHS. ""The key difference between voters and non-voters is that the latter are not making the connection between these issues in principle and the political and electoral system in practice.""Only 19% of non-voters gave 'no interest in politics' as their main reason for not voting, compared with 42% who said either parties and candidates are all the same or what they believe isn't represented by the parties or candidates. ""When asked what might make them more likely to cast a vote, many respondents wanted more information about the parties and candidates, but a significant minority wrote verbatim comments within the research that they wanted better candidates to vote for, or else that there simply was nothing that would persuade them to vote.""Tap here to find out which election is taking place in your area."
2016-05-05,Olympian record?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160505035509/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36170239,"Boris Johnson's eight years as London Mayor comes to an end this week when his successor will be elected. But what legacy does he leave for the capital?Cast your mind back to the summer of 2007, when the Conservatives were a party in search of a mayoral candidate. When Boris Johnson's name was first mooted, it was met with incredulity and mockery from many quarters - and blank denial from officials.  But even critics who dismissed him as a clown could see instantly the possibilities for all the wit, charm and intellectualism. And Ken Livingstone realised instantly that the Henley MP could well prove to be his nemesis.Boris Johnson's allies say he helped London come through the economic crash and surfed an Olympic wave to make the capital feel good about itself again. The London mayoralty was not just the making of Boris Johnson, more his salvation.It allowed him a second chance to build a credible political career after his first foundered on reports about his personal life, tabloid ridicule and parliamentary mediocrity.The speeches now marking his farewell from City Hall have underlined the positive trends to come out of it. He has pointed to falling crime, rising employment, an efficient transport system, greater life expectancy even, as evidence of his inspirational leadership and steadiness at the helm. But did he repay the voters' faith and make enough use of the powers and levers at his disposal?He certainly defied - in fact capitalised on - low expectations and serious underestimation. In itself it showed a kind of genius. The comic dishevelment engaged; the harrumphing humour disarmed. And nothing blunted the ambition and political calculation.He owes London big, having arrived at City Hall in 2008 with a scant knowledge of and little past documented interest in the affairs of the capital. He leaves having amassed a broad experience of how to run things - furnished, effectively, with a crash course in governance.But if his personal popularity appears to have been buoyed by - or survived, depending on your point of view - two terms in office, does he also now demand to be considered credible as an administrator, as someone who made a difference? Mr Johnson exploited brilliantly the occasion of London 2012, long in the planning. To a large extent his first mayoral term was preoccupied with the Games, and ensuring he was still in place to enjoy the spoils by winning his second term in office just three months before the global sporting event took place in his city.But many critical observers feel that after that glorious month, the second half of his mayoralty was low both on substance and strategy - not disguised by the occasional ""grand vision"" for the capital in 2020 or 2050 or beyond.He can rightly claim to have helped set east London on the way to an Olympic infrastructure legacy. Homes are being built (although many at prices unheard of in the area a few years ago), and there's an academic, cultural and sporting hub taking shape (even if West Ham United Football Club got a supreme deal to move into the iconic stadium).But the transformed life chances promised for the local population did not materialise from the legacy programmes to help the long-term jobless. Elsewhere, he derived much political capital from the progress of Crossrail, but other major infrastructure projects were hard to come by. Small pots of cash appeared now and then from a chancellor with whom he had a less than warm relationship, for feasibility studies into river crossings and other transport links.In the main, critics argue, this has been about reinstating the ideas of Ken Livingstone that could have got off the ground years ago, and that it characterises Mr Johnson's time more as hiatus than progress. Mr Johnson paints a brighter picture of his regeneration in ""opportunity areas"" where new communities are taking shape. He often points at Battersea's crumbling old power station, where the Northern Line is being extended, two new stations built and a cluster of very tall buildings emerging around the US embassy and a Chinese-backed luxury hotel. Little taxpayers' money has been necessary.But this too tells its own story: vast amounts of Malaysian money, lots of off-plan foreign buying but virtually no affordable housing. Plans for homes for more than 20,000 people, but not one new state secondary school. And the only health facility happening so far?  A private clinic. Not the kind of community some hoped would be created.Overall on housing, Mr Johnson can claim that numerically he built more affordable homes than Mr Livingstone. But ""affordability"" is now more loosely defined. And once the money injected by Gordon Brown's government ran out, the trajectory was downwards: 55,000 affordable homes in Johnson's first term; 45,000 in his second.He talks of looking out of his City Hall window at the cranes and diggers he says signify a revival, a building boom even. But he's been in charge at a time of arguably London's worst housing crisis. Did he do what he could? Although the capital's population is rising by 100,000 each year - and for all the flexible non-prescriptive approach, warm encouragement to developers and removal of barriers to build - only 5,000 affordable new homes were completed last year as Mr Johnson prepared to leave the scene.There have been operational transport trends to celebrate. Punctuality and performance on the Tube improved, and the London Overground rail network has flourished. However, relations with the unions remained strained, and no trust was established. It has led to the introduction of a weekend all-night Tube service being delayed.Mr Johnson will certainly be remembered for a fondness for monuments: visual statements like the Thames cable car (completed), the Garden Bridge (a work in progress) and the ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture (currently being modified to include a slide).What has remained undimmed is his sense of place and liveability. He has planted trees and encouraged urban horticulture, and tried to keep alive the Olympic volunteering spirit. But he embraced skyscrapers too warmly for many and his vision of ""space-sharing"" - where motorists, cyclists and pedestrians co-existed in a kind of highway harmony - soon fell by the wayside, with traffic congestion now right back up there as a major gripe and a big problem left for his successor to sort out.He will always be associated with bikes, and more people are now cycling in London than ever before. Yet the ""cycling revolution"" has come along a perilous pot-holed path. A sponsorship deal with Barclays for the hire scheme wasn't good enough for him to fulfil the promise to make it self-financing, and the first iteration of a new network of cycle routes had to be re-thought after death and injury.He faced uncomfortable months, when he was accused of failing to match a tally-ho enthusiasm on cycling with safe public policy. Yet today segregated cycle lanes are being introduced, which it is hoped could lead to a step-change in habits and give the outgoing mayor a genuine two-wheeled legacy.Just as awkward for a time was the test of leadership that was his response to the phone-hacking scandal. He dismissed it originally as ""codswallop"", and was accused of not using his office to push the Metropolitan police to do more sooner - something he denied at the time.Helped by his own considerable success as a journalist, he's been assiduous in keeping friends in the right places. His highly remunerative column still engages readers of the Telegraph and he holidays at the Tuscan villa of the owner of the Independent and Evening Standard. All good positioning for the leadership manoeuvres ahead.But did he deploy his London mandate to the full?On top of the direct powers and budget responsibilities of the office comes the vast scope to influence. And with Mr Johnson, themes came and went.For a while it looked as if the life chances of young people would become a major focus. He pledged to sponsor at least 10 academies, partnered with business. Just four materialised, one was deemed by Ofsted to be struggling, and the programme was discontinued.There was energy devoted to gangs and rehabilitating young offenders. But the mayor made exaggerated claims about the success of a flagship youth offending scheme, and with ""payment by results"" hampering the project, this too fell off the mayoral agenda. Meanwhile, violent crime is starting to rise again.It could be argued that austerity and difficult finances made the synergy between Conservative mayor and a Conservative-led government less fruitful for the capital than many expected - hindered perhaps by rivalries and resentments.On various occasions Mr Johnson irked the prime minister, though David Cameron never betrayed it publicly. The mayor blamed police cuts at the time of the 2011 summer riots, talked unhelpfully about welfare changes in terms of ""Kosovo-style"" ethnic cleansing, and objected loudly when a Cabinet reshuffle appeared to signal a shift towards further expansion at Heathrow.His relationship with the Home Secretary Theresa May - never warm - found a new chill when she refused to approve the use of his (already paid for) second-hand German water cannon.As they began to emerge as Mr Cameron's two most likely successors, Messrs Johnson and Osborne jousted behind the scenes over what London needed and what it would be given.  At City Hall, the mayor left much of the detail and heavy-lifting to a cadre of deputies and advisers. The verdict of many who have watched him most closely is that he has often been pragmatic, rarely letting the best be the enemy of the good.But a big question raised is over the limited nature of what he set out to achieve and the perceived lack of ambition. Perhaps with the thoughts on the future, venturing little provided less chance of failing. In the story of London's progress under an elected mayoralty, will his time come to be seen mainly as an entertaining intermission?  Find out more about who's standing in the London elections."

He said: ""Labour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone - not just its activists. ""Campaigns that deliberately turn their back on particular groups are doomed to fail. Just like in London, so-called natural Labour voters alone will never be enough to win a general election. ""We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security, as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.""BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Khan's comments would be seen as a message not just to Jeremy Corbyn but also to the Labour leader's critics.As he took office as London mayor in a ceremony in Southwark Cathedral, Mr Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants, promised to ""make our city better"" and be ""a mayor for all Londoners"".He also pledged to lead ""the most transparent, engaged and accessible administration London has ever seen"".The former Labour minister's victory in London ends eight years of Conservative control of City Hall.Mr Corbyn welcomed Mr Rees' victory, saying in a tweet: ""Another Labour mayor who will stand up for their city!""But the Labour leader was absent from Mr Khan's swearing-in ceremony earlier on Saturday, travelling instead to Bristol to congratulate that city's new mayor Marvin Rees. ""I am meeting Sadiq over the weekend, I have been in touch with him. We are getting on fine. I have sent him a message of congratulations,"" the Labour leader said.In other results from Thursday's election, Nicola Sturgeon's SNP party celebrated its third successive victory in the Holyrood election - though the result left the SNP two seats short of a majority in the parliament.In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionists remain the biggest party in the Assembly, with Arlene Foster continuing as first minister.In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs.Labour's vote share was down about 6% on average on 2012 - the last time the seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, and Plaid Cymru is up by two points. UKIP increased its vote by 12 points and saw seven candidates elected.The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. The Sadiq Khan story"

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.""Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions""."
2016-05-06,Hamilton bid to lead UKIP in assembly,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-wales-36233182,"Neil Hamilton is expected to challenge Nathan Gill to lead UKIP's new assembly group, sources have told BBC Wales.The former Tory MP has denied a suggestion by a senior UKIP source that he will try to change party rules giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage sole power to appoint the leader in Wales. Current UKIP rules allow different politicians to lead the assembly group and the party in Wales.A source close to Mr Gill said he was confident most UKIP AMs would back him.Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill were among seven new UKIP AMs elected on Thursday.Gareth Bennett, Mark Reckless, David Rowlands and Mr Gill took the oath of office at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay on Saturday.Mr Hamilton and another newly-elected AM - Caroline Jones - were present but were not sworn in.Party sources expect Mr Hamilton to make the leadership challenge on Tuesday to Mr Gill, who was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Mr Farage in 2014. Mr Hamilton and Ms Jones are expected to take the oath on Tuesday morning, after attending a meeting of UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday.At the meeting they will stand down from the NEC, which is required under UKIP's rules now that they have become elected politicians.A senior UKIP source suggested Mr Hamilton might use the meeting to attempt to change party rules stating that UKIP's national leader has the sole power to appoint the party's leader in Wales.Mr Hamilton has denied he has such a plan.Earlier on Saturday, Mr Hamilton told BBC Radio Wales that UKIP AMs would agree next week who should lead their group.He stressed that Mr Gill was not automatically in charge and said there were ""many people in UKIP"" with the right skills for the the job.  ""We're going to have a collective discussion when we all meet together and we'll come up with a decision as to which of us is likely to be the most effective leader in the assembly,"" he said.Asked if he would be the best candidate, Mr Hamilton added: ""I, of course, have a lot of parliamentary experience and so has [fellow UKIP AM and ex-Tory MP] Mark Reckless.""I've been around in politics for a very long time at quite a high level, and we have many people in UKIP who've got the kind of skills which will be advantageous to a leader.   ""But I'm not going to pre-empt the discussions that we will have, probably on Tuesday.""First Minister Carwyn Jones is spending the weekend preparing to form a new government, after Labour won 29 of the 60 seats, losing just one to Plaid.The new assembly is expected to hold its first meeting next week. Discussions are ongoing between the parties to decide who should be presiding officer and deputy presiding officer, and take charge of assembly proceedings.The Conservative assembly group will meet on Monday to discuss strategy, after a disappointing election under Welsh leader Andrew RT Davies.The party failed to win any target seats and lost three to fall into third place behind Plaid Cymru.Monmouth AM Nick Ramsay said the Conservatives' problems could not be ""brushed under the table"" and the leadership needed to be discussed.He called it a ""difficult"" campaign but backed Mr Davies.""The 11 of us that are now left need to look at where we go from here,"" he said.""[We need to] decide how we get there and then look at all issues, including the leadership, but other issues as well such as the strategy the group adopts.""A Welsh Conservative spokesman described the campaign as ""very positive"" and ""ambitious"" with ""great ideas"".""There's a fifth party in play now, which has affected everyone else,"" he said, referring to UKIP.""We've proven we can challenge in key seats next time around.""Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party would be ""constructive but playing the crucial role of a strong opposition"" to Labour. ""We will use that wisely to put forward a vision for the country which is as clear now as it was the day before the election,"" he said.Kirsty Williams, the only surviving Lib Dem AM, has resigned as leader of the party in Wales after it lost four of its five Senedd seats.Labour looks likely to form another minority Labour administration after an election in which only one constituency changed hands.And yet, the election has revealed a big change in Welsh politics - a change that has arrived in Cardiff Bay in the form of seven UKIP AMs who won seats on the regional lists.They say they want to shake the place up. But Nigel Farage also says they want to play a constructive role.I'm not sure how you achieve both.Either way, there's a question facing UKIP - who will lead them in Wales?Nathan Gill was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Nigel Farage in 2014 - a job he's compared to ""herding cats"".It sounds as though Neil Hamilton - the former Tory MP whose political career has been re-booted by this election - would be only too happy to relieve him of his duty.But his elevation is unlikely to heal rifts in the party. Even the suggestion that he could be a candidate in this election caused a row in UKIP's ranks."
2016-05-06,Doctors to decide on NHS contract talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36234731,"Junior doctor representatives at the British Medical Association (BMA) will meet later to decide whether to hold talks with the government over a disputed new NHS employment contract.Negotiations over the contract broke down in February and junior doctors have staged several strikes since then.Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they could focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours.The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says there should be no preconditions.The government says it is willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA agreed in principle to the idea of restarting talks and also to a possible deferral of any new threat of strikes for five days.BBC health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be ""clarity about the next steps by the end of the day"".  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday."" Mr Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continue discussions.Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.Last week, there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS."

The final count in Upper Bann ended on Saturday afternoon.Northern Ireland Assembly election resultsThe DUP has 38 seats, while Sinn Féin has 28, the Ulster Unionists 16, SDLP 12 and the Alliance Party eight.The Greens and People Before Profit Alliance have two seats each. The TUV leader Jim Allister remains its sole representative.In terms of the last assembly, the DUP holds the same number of seats and Sinn Féin has dropped one seat.It has been a difficult election for both the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.In the end, the Ulster Unionists ended up with the same number of seats as before, but the SDLP lost two seats, one in Foyle and the other, after a marathon counting session, was Dolores Kelly's seat in Upper Bann.DUP leader Mrs Foster said: ""I'm absolutely delighted with the mandate that my party has been given to drive forward Northern Ireland into the future."" ""Of course, people have spoken and they have spoken very clearly.""Looking at the Sinn Féin strategy in this election, Gerry Kelly said: ""I think what we will do is take it constituency by constituency and look at vote management and all of the rest of it. I think, to a great extent, that the vote management wasn't that bad.""Moments from count centres across Northern IrelandHe said his part knew that Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit would take the seat in West Belfast.""We agree with what a lot of what People Before Profit say. There are some things we disagree with. We said we would work with them in the south and we will certainly work with them in the north."" UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said his party's campaign had been neither a success, nor a failure. He said the party would return 16 seats, the same as in 2011, but signalled a ""change of personnel"".SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had been left with ""a lot of work to do"".  ""All of us need to learn lessons that Stormont is not delivering and people are not happy about that,"" he said.""We've had a rough couple of years, we've begun to change the face of the party and we're going to build from here.""BBC's Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler's view of the future assembly Alliance Party leader David Ford said his party had had a ""safe enough election compared to other parties"" and he was now concerned about shaping a programme for government that's ""inclusive and will promote the needs of all people in Northern Ireland"".Gerry Carroll won People Before Profit's first ever assembly seat in West Belfast at the expense of Sinn Féin.Anti-austerity party picks up seatsHe was followed by his colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann who took a seat from the SDLP in Foyle to secure his place at Stormont.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.The DUP's Frank McCoubrey came within 89 votes of winning a first unionist seat in West Belfast since the 2003 election, but he just lost out to Alex Attwood of the SDLP.Jim Allister retained his North Antrim seat for the Traditional Unionist Voice and Claire Bailey secured one for the Green Party in South Belfast.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt came out on top in the Strangford poll.But he said his pre-election prediction of the number of seats his party would win had been ""ambitious"".Naomi Long will return to Stormont for the Alliance Party, winning in East Belfast a year after she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP in the same constituency.Passing the 30 seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.But it lost a seat to Jenny Palmer, one of its former councillors who left the party last year after claiming she had been bullied. She was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.West Tyrone declared its first seat on Saturday - the SDLP's Daniel McCrossan - after the eighth count.Several MLAs from the previous assembly will not be returning to Stormont, with the independent John McCallister, the DUP's Ian McCrea and Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin among the most high-profile figures to lose their seats.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates stood in Thursday's election, with 108 seats in Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies up for grabs.In all, 703,744 people voted, and the turnout of 54.91% was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation, and about 2,000 count staff have been working at eight centres across Northern Ireland."
2016-05-06,Unions hail scrapping of academy plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36234989,"Teaching unions have welcomed the government's decision to ditch plans to force all state schools in England to become academies.  They said the move was recognition that ""one size"" did not fit all schools.Ministers said the government had listened to critics but the goal to turn schools into academies remained. Schools judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding will now not have to become academies, nor will small rural schools have to join a multi-academy trust.  The forced academisation proposals had been opposed by some Conservative MPs and councillors, as well as by unions and others. The government argues that academies drive up standards by giving more power to head teachers and allowing them to be more innovative. Critics have contended that academisation amounts to privatising the education system and say it is simplistic to say academies raise standards. Cabinet minister Michael Fallon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have now decided, having listened to parents and governors and our backbenchers that there is a better route to it, which is not forcing every school immediately to become an academy.""He said academisation would now focus only on schools that were ""clearly failing"".Asked whether ministers had tried to ""bury"" the announcement on a busy day for news, Mr Fallon said it would not have been ""legally"" possible to issue it in the preceding days because of the ""purdah"" restrictions on the activities of civil servants in election periods. Paul Luxmoore, executive head teacher of the Coastal Academies Trust in Kent, told Today he was ""dismayed"" at the policy reversal.""We've reached the tipping point, where local authorities - who have been delivering school improvements to schools until now - no longer have the capacity, or the money to do that effectively. Hence the government policy to make all schools academies over the next four years was entirely predictable and entirely sensible,"" he said.""I think they've lost their courage to go ahead with it because of all sorts of other political reasons [that have] very little to do with education.""Andy Miller, head teacher at St Nicholas Church of England Primary School in Blackpool, said the forced academisation plan had been a mistake. ""I would argue that head teachers, their governing bodies and their parent community actually know what's best for individual schools - rather than somebody in Westminster saying this is good for all of you,"" he said.National Association of Head Teachers president Kim Johnson said his organisation wanted ministers to understand ""that actually there isn't a case of one size fits all"" for schools. ""We're the intelligent practitioners and we want that opportunity, at the table with government, to further those discussions."" Tory backbencher Graham Brady, who welcomed the abandonment of the plans, said that ""the more that we can have these debates and discussions before legislation is brought forward, the better"".Alasdair Smith, from campaign group Anti Academies Alliance, said: ""We've known for more than 30 years exactly what improves schools, and it's not rocket science, it's high quality teaching and learning and good leadership. ""The government has not been pursuing that agenda, they've been pursuing structural change, and they've ignored high quality teaching, and high quality leadership, and that's why the policy is now in tatters.""Academies are independently run - but state-funded - schools, overseen by a not-for-profit business, known as an academy trust. They are often part of a chain.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said scrapping the plans was ""frankly a humiliating climbdown for David Cameron and his education secretary"".However, the government said it would push forward with compelling academy conversions in two areas:The government also announced measures to protect small rural schools including extra financial support and a requirement that any closure would have to be agreed by the local authority and the regional schools commissioner."
2016-05-06,SNP celebrate - as Labour 'hang on',https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36218450,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has downplayed talk of another independence referendum after winning the party's third election victory in a row.Confirming she would form a minority government at Holyrood, she said her aim was to ""persuade, not to divide"". Despite Labour coming third in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party had ""hung on"" and done better than expected in Wales and England.Sadiq Khan leads the London Mayoral election as counting continues.With all the results declared in Scotland, the SNP is the largest party with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24.Labour remains the dominant party in Wales, winning 29 out of 60 seats, but falling just short of a majority. Plaid Cymru pipped the Tories to be the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly while UKIP won seven seats on a good night for the party.Counting continues across English councils but the BBC is forecasting that, on the basis of the results so far, Labour would have got a 31% projected share of the national vote, with the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.Elections expert John Curtice said the result - calculated on the basis the UK electorate as a whole had behaved in the same way as voters did in the English local elections - was slightly better than Labour might have expected.In the London Mayoral race, a live update of the vote tally shows Labour candidate Sadiq Khan currently ahead of his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. In Northern Ireland, the first results for the assembly election are being declared with the final result due on Saturday. Tap here to search for election results in your area.Speaking in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said that despite falling two seats short of a majority, the SNP had secured an ""emphatic"" victory and had a ""clear and unequivocal"" mandate. She said the party would govern on its own rather than in alliance with other parties. On the issue of a future vote on independence, she said the SNP will make ""our case with passion, with patience but will always respect the opinion of the people"".But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said any prospect of the issue being reopened in the next five years had been ""utterly shredded"" by the SNP's failure to win a majority. Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.But nor is there much evidence of enthusiasm for the Conservative government in England. The Tories so far have picked up a handful of seats, traditionally an achievement for a party in power at these kinds of polls.But for success, and unexpected success, the Conservatives can look to Scotland where it appears they are set to take second place, - a fundamental change in Scotland. But there, voters again expressed their faith and belief in the Scottish National Party as their government.Read more from LauraIn the English council elections, BBC analysis suggests the Tory vote fell in southern England, which may have helped Labour to retain control of councils in areas such as Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where its vote was looking vulnerable.Labour's vote share is down about 6% on average on 2012  - the last time these seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But a BBC analysis suggests its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.Its share was more sharply down in Scotland. The party gained one seat from the SNP - Edinburgh Southern - but failed to take other targets and was beaten into third place by the Conservatives - a result that would have been unthinkable in the past.Labour also lost its Rhondda Welsh Assembly seat, in its south Wales heartlands, to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In other developments:Brighter news for Labour came with it holding the seat of Sheffield Brightside in a Westminster by-election, with UKIP coming second. The party also held Ogmore in another Parliamentary by-election, in South Wales, with UKIP again in second place. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Corbyn said it had ""grown support"" in parts of England but he acknowledged the scale of the defeat in Scotland, saying there was a ""lot of building"" to do. Amid speculation about Mr Corbyn's future, his deputy Tom Watson said he needed ""more time"" to show he could revive Labour fortunes.But MP Michael Dugher said Labour was ""not on a trajectory"" to victory in 2020 while shadow scottish secretary Ian Murray suggested the public did not see Labour ""at the moment as being a credible party of future government"". For the Conservatives, the highlights of the evening were in Scotland, winning the Holyrood seat of Eastwood from Labour and Ruth Davidson's winning Edinburgh Central from the SNP.David Cameron said the party's second place in Scotland and its showing in England, where it took control of Peterborough Council and won council seats in key Westminster marginals such as Dudley and Nuneaton, represented a good result for a party in government for six years.""Local election day for sitting prime ministers is supposed to be a day of dread, waiting for the knock on the door like a condemned man waiting for a hangman,"" he said. ""But that's wasn't what it was like last night.""In a surprise result in Wales, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood unseated Labour's Leighton Andrews in the Rhondda - described by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain as ""a terrible shock for us in Welsh Labour"".Ms Wood said: ""A new dawn has already broken over the Valleys, people have voted for change.""In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, while Plaid Cymru is up by two points.The big story of the night in Wales was the performance of UKIP, which saw its vote increase by 12 points. The party's leader Nigel Farage hailed it as a significant breakthrough. In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs. The majority of the seats were last contested in 2012.Thursday's polls were the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020, with 43 million people entitled to take part.What's still to come (all timings are estimates)Friday 6 May11:30 onwards: Forty four councils in England declaring on Friday15:00: First results of London Assembly elections17:00: First preference vote share information for elections to Northern Ireland Assembly1800: Result of first preference votes for Mayor of London (final result expected early evening)Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England and Salford mayoral contest are also expected on Friday.Saturday 7 May14:00 Results from five remaining councils in England16:00 Result of Bristol Mayoral contestResult of elections to Northern Ireland Assembly expectedSunday 8 May16:00 Result of elections to Bristol Council (final council in England to declare)Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in Wales"
2016-05-06,DUP past 30 seats in NI Assembly election,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-northern-ireland-36212550,"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has passed the 30-seats mark after the first day of counting in the Northern Ireland Assembly election.Three-quarters of the 108 seats have been filled, with the DUP on 33.Eleven constituencies have been fully declared, and counting has ended for the night in seven areas.So far, Sinn Féin has 19 seats, Ulster Unionists have 10, the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) has nine and the Alliance Party has six.Passing the 30-seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.Gerry Carroll won a first ever assembly seat for the People Before Profit Alliance, topping the poll in West Belfast for the left-wing party to take one of the five seats Sinn Féin had held in the constituency.The SDLP's Alex Attwood retained his West Belfast seat by a narrow margin, overcoming DUP challenger Frank McCoubrey by just 89 votes.Mr Carroll said his success was evidence that voters had become ""fed-up with the status quo"" and were ""looking for a political alternative"".He was joined by his party colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann, who was elected in Foyle, taking a seat from the SDLP.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in his home constituency of Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat when he was eliminated after the first count, but he said his his nine years as an MLA had been a ""privilege"".He was twice elected as an Ulster Unionist but left the party in 2013 to form the ill-fated NI21, which imploded just over a year later.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said he was ""stunned"" to top the Strangford poll, but acknowledged that he had been ""ambitious"" with his prediction of the number of seats his party would win.Alliance Party leader David Ford crossed the line in South Antrim and Jim Allister, who leads the Traditional Unionist Voice, was re-elected in North Antrim.Former MP Naomi Long will return to frontline politics after her election for the Alliance Party in East Belfast, where she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP last year.The DUP's Joanne Bunting has taken the East Belfast seat vacated by former first minister Peter Robinson, who retired earlier this year.In South Belfast, the city's former lord mayor Máirtín Ó Muilleoir was elected after topping the poll and Claire Bailey gained a seat in the constituency for the Green Party, saying she wanted to ""change the conversation at Stormont"".The DUP also made a gain in the constituency, with councillor Christopher Stalford taking the seat that had been held by the UUP.Jenny Palmer, a councillor who left the DUP last year after claiming she had been bullied, took a seat off her former party when she was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.Former agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew, who left the assembly to serve as an MP, will return to Stormont after her election for Sinn Féin in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.William Irwin of the DUP came top of the poll Newry and Armagh, while former Armagh gaelic footballer Justin McNulty will be another new face in the assembly for the SDLP after securing his party's single seat in the constituency.Three Sinn Féin candidates came through in Mid Ulster, but the DUP's McCrea dynasty came to an end when Ian, the son of former MP and MLA William, lost his seat to party colleague Keith Buchanan.Former health minister Jim Wells, who has endured a series of controversies in the past two years, was re-elected in South Down.He made a formal complaint to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland after his wife and the husband of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) candidate Sinéad Bradley were denied entry to the count.The leaders of the two largest parties in Northern Ireland will be delighted by the results so far.The DUP is on course to hold the seats it took in 2011 and Sinn Féin are hopeful they will better their 2011 election when they won 29 seats.In contrast, it has been a disappointing day for the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates have been competing across Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies.In all, 703,744 people voted in the election, representing a turnout of 54.91%, which was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.In general terms, turnout in eastern constituencies has increased compared to 2011, but dropped in western constituencies.More than 2,000 staff are involved in counting the votes in eight centres across Northern Ireland.In Northern Ireland, MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation.Seven counts will resume on Saturday morning, with the final seats not due to be declared later in the day."
2016-05-06,Police probe Tory election expenses,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36231138,"Eight police forces are investigating whether Conservative MPs filed election expenses illegally after the 2015 General Election, the BBC understands.The allegations centre around failing to register the accommodation costs of party activists who were involved in the ""battle bus"" operation. The party has blamed an ""administrative error"".A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.The activists on the party's battle bus targeted marginal seats. The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.Failing to file correct expenses is a criminal offence.The eight forces actively investigating are West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, Greater Manchester Police, Devon and Cornwall Police, Gloucestershire Police, Northamptonshire Police, Staffordshire Police, and Cheshire Police.A further four forces are waiting for further information, the BBC understands.Police can investigate such claims up to a year after the election expenses were filed, and West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, and Greater Manchester Police have started the process of getting extensions to the time limit.A Conservative spokesperson said: ""As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus. ""However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return.  ""The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. ""Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning.""The Electoral Commission - which is an independent body that sets standards for running elections - is also investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act during the general election.The Commission has powers in relation to national campaign spending, although its sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance at the Electoral Commission, said: ""The police and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. ""We have requested that they consider doing this."" "
2016-05-06,"Labour's 'hung on', Jeremy Corbyn says",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36228094,"Jeremy Corbyn said his party had ""hung on"" and defied predictions of local election losses in England.The Labour leader hailed an ""excellent"" result in Wales and pledged to ""walk hand in hand"" with Scottish colleagues after they slipped to third behind the Conservatives.Labour retained control of several key councils in England and remained the largest party in Wales.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told ""begrudgers"" to ""put up or shut up"".Pollsters had predicted losses for Labour in the local elections, with the party defending gains it made in 2012 under Ed Miliband.Speaking alongside Gill Furniss, who won Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough in one of two Labour Parliamentary by-election holds, Mr Corbyn said: ""All across England last night we were getting predictions that we were going to lose councils. We didn't.""We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places.""He congratulated the ""hard work"" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: ""There is a lot of building to do in Scotland. ""We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again.""They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a ""weak leader"" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as ""shocking"". The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.""We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats,"" Tim Roache, its general secretary said. ""Let's give it a go. Let's give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen? Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day.

2016-05-06,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-06,The Sadiq Khan story,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36140479,"Labour's Sadiq Khan has been elected as London's new mayor - but who is the man who will be in charge of the UK's capital city for the next four years?Sadiq Khan's life to date has been characterised by beating the odds - which is what he has just done to become mayor of London.When Labour politicians put themselves forward to run for mayor last year, Mr Khan was far from being the favourite. The bookies' money was on Baroness Jowell, a veteran of the Tony Blair years who had helped bring the Olympics to London. But if there is a pattern in Mr Khan's career, it's one of coming from behind. The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. Age: 45Marital status: Married with two daughtersPolitical party: LabourTime as MP: Has represented Tooting in south London since 2005Previous jobs: Human rights solicitor, chair of Liberty""Son of a bus driver"" became one of the most hackneyed phrases in Mr Khan's time on the stump - so overused in his leaflets and speeches that he was eventually forced to make fun of his own campaign, joking he had given the Daily Mirror an ""exclusive"" on his background. But his parents' story holds real significance for him. Amanullah and Sehrun Khan emigrated from Pakistan to London shortly before Sadiq was born, in 1970. He was the fifth of their eight children - seven sons and a daughter. He has often said that his early impressions of the world of work shaped his belief in the trade union movement. His father, a bus driver for 25 years, ""was in a union and got decent pay and conditions"" whereas his mum, a stay-at-home seamstress, ""wasn't, and didn't"".He lived with his parents and siblings in a cramped three-bedroomed house on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield, south-west London, sharing a bunkbed with one of his brothers until he left home in his 20s. He attended the local comprehensive, Ernest Bevin College, which he describes as ""a tough school - it wasn't always a bed of roses"". The nickname ""Bevin boys"" was at that time in that part of south London a byword for bad behaviour.It was at school that he first began to gravitate towards politics, joining the Labour Party aged 15. He credits the school's head, Naz Bokhari, who happened to be the first Muslim headteacher at a UK secondary school, with making him realise ""skin colour or background wasn't a barrier to making something with your life"".Mr Khan was raised a Muslim and has never shied away from acknowledging the importance of his faith. In his maiden speech as an MP he spoke about his father teaching him Mohammed's sayings, or hadiths - in particular the principle that ""if one sees something wrong, one has the duty to try to change it"".He was an able student who loved football, boxing and cricket - he even had a trial for Surrey County Cricket Club as a teenager. He has since spoken about the racist abuse he and his brothers faced at Wimbledon and Chelsea football matches, saying he felt ""safer"" watching at home and became a Liverpool fan simply ""because they were playing such great football at the time"".He studied maths and science at A-level with the idea of becoming a dentist. He was switched on to law by a teacher who told him ""you're always arguing"" - and by the TV programme LA Law, starring Jimmy Smits as Victor Sifuentes, a charismatic partner in a California law firm.""LA law was about lawyers in LA who do great cases, act for the underdog, drove nice cars, look great and I wanted to be Sifuentes,"" Mr Khan told Business Insider recently.He studied law at the University of North London and put his degree to good use straight away, becoming a trainee solicitor in 1994 at Christian Fisher under the human rights lawyer Louise Christian. The same year he met and married his wife Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor and coincidentally the daughter of a bus driver - with whom he went on to have two daughters, Anisah and Ammarah. He also began his 12-year stint as a councillor for Tooting, encouraged by Guyanan-born local activist Bert Luthers.Just three years later, aged 27, he was made an equity partner and the firm was renamed Christian Khan.During this time he worked on a number of high-profile cases: he won compensation for Kenneth Hsu, a hairdresser wrongly arrested and assaulted by the police; teachers and lawyers who had experienced racial discrimination; Leroy Logan, a senior black police officer accused of fraud; corrupt former Met Police commander Ali Dizaei; and helped overturn an exclusion order (later upheld on appeal) on US political activist Louis Farrakhan.The irony of a man who represented people in cases against the Met going on to become the force's chief scrutineer has not been lost on his opponents. Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith, speaking at an event alongside Home Secretary Theresa May, recently characterised Mr Khan's legal career as ""coaching people in suing our police"".He left his law firm somewhat abruptly in 2004, afterwards telling the Law Gazette: ""If you're in government, you're a legislator and you have the opportunity to make laws that can improve things for millions of people.""In 2005, Mr Khan fought and retained the marginal seat of Tooting for Labour, one of five new ethnic minority MPs elected that year.Contemporaries on either side of the political divide remember being impressed by a ""fiercely bright"" and ""persuasive"" individual who was ""impossible not to listen to"". He combines that sharpness with what is often called his ""cheeky chappy"" demeanour. He is fond of calling people ""mate"" and has even done so on the floor of the Commons.Two months after he entered the Commons, he was thrust into the limelight by the 7 July bombings. When Parliament met to discuss the attacks, he told MPs: ""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted on Thursday; proud of the way ordinary courageous Londoners carried on with their business and stopped the criminals disrupting our life.""In a 2010 Guardian interview, he recalled thinking: ""I couldn't hide - and I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but there were so few articulate voices of reason from the British Muslim community. ""There were angry men with beards, but nobody saying, 'Actually, I'm very comfortable being a Brit, being a Muslim, being a Londoner'."" The intervention marked him out as one to watch, but his path to promotion was not altogether smooth. Mr Khan wore his civil liberties credentials on his sleeve, challenging the government over ID cards and joining 48 other Labour rebels to vote against prime minister Tony Blair's plan to allow the detention of terror suspects without charge for up to 90 days. He later claimed party chiefs had penalised him by preventing him from visiting Pakistan in the wake of an earthquake there and did not want to give him an office with a sofa.But the rebellion was not altogether to his disadvantage. Tony Blair was on his way out, and Mr Khan was able to position himself on the ascendant ""soft left"" of the Labour party alongside Ed Balls and Gordon Brown. ""It was a tough school; it wasn't always a bed of roses. But you become street wise, you become savvy and you learn social skills - you learn about how to deal with people."" - on his schooldays""The way allegations of misconduct against police officers are investigated is flawed and inadequate."" - as a human rights solicitor""Although I'd won cases at the European Court of Human Rights, and I'd won cases in the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal, I still couldn't escape the fact that if you're part of the legislature and the executive, you can make legislation that improves the quality of life for literally millions of people."" - on leaving law to become an MP""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted."" - on the 7/7 attacks""Most people feel nagged by their parents from time to time, but very rarely is it about the future of bus regulation."" - on his father ""I sleep in my own bed. When I get home I put the rubbish out and get my girls up to go to school."" - on staying grounded""For the last eight years you've seen a red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hand. I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners."" - on launching his mayoral bidWhen Gordon Brown took over at Number 10, Mr Khan was given his first job in government as a whip and then as communities minister, a move that created disquiet among some other MPs in the capital who had been around for longer.A post at the Department for Transport followed in 2009 and he became the first Muslim in the Cabinet. This was at a time when there were only four Muslim MPs and he was often confused for international development minister Shahid Malik.He would go on to claim during the mayoral campaign that as transport minister he had ""pushed"" Crossrail through Parliament, but the Mayorwatch website has shown Mr Khan only took on responsibility for the project after the relevant bill had become law. At the 2010 election, Mr Khan's own majority was squeezed to an uncomfortably small margin of just 2,524 votes and Labour was out of government for the first time in 13 years.In the chaotic months of Labour soul-searching that followed, he again showed a canny ability to ally himself with what was seemingly a lost cause and turn it into success.True to his Brownite colours, he was chosen as Ed Miliband's campaign manager and helped steer the less-favoured Miliband brother towards an unexpected leadership election victory.He told the New Statesman afterwards that the night before the result, he told Miliband to ""prepare for defeat"". ""I learned this from (television series) Rumpole of the Bailey,"" he said. ""Always tell your client he's going to lose because, if he loses, he's expecting it; if he wins, you're the fantastic lawyer who got the victory."" However, he added: ""I had a feeling we'd done it.""In that contest, as in the Labour mayoral nomination, Mr Khan's support for the trade union movement helped his campaign secure crucial votes.He was rewarded with the post of shadow justice secretary - a role in which he did not get off to an auspicious start. His first major speech was badly received when he chose to highlight Labour's failings in government, and in then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke he faced an adversary with whom he admitted he struggled to find things to disagree about.His other brief as shadow political reform minister did not provide much of a chance to shine either, as the coalition needed little help killing off its own proposals for Lords reform and his personal support for changes to the voting system was tempered by his view that the referendum on this - which saw the British public reject change - came at the wrong time.When Mr Clarke was sacked and replaced with Chris Grayling, however, Mr Khan was able to take the fight to the despatch box more convincingly as a vocal opponent of reforms to legal aid and restrictions on books in prisons.When the Conservatives later reversed several of Mr Grayling's flagship policies he described it as a ""huge climbdown"" that showed Labour had been right to resist them.Labour's disastrous showing in the 2015 election and the swift resignation of Ed Miliband - the man he had helped to the leadership - could have thrown Mr Khan off-course, but he found a new focus for his campaigning energy.Just a week after the election he announced he would seek the Labour nomination for mayor. He had already been tipped as a possible contender at least a year but, with typical shrewdness, he had steadfastly refused to be drawn on the subject in public while sounding out MPs and councillors in private to see if he had enough support.Once he had confirmed his mayoral ambitions, his quest for the nomination - let alone an election win - still seemed like a long shot. Baroness Jowell, who had been MP for Dulwich and West Norwood for 23 years and held a number of senior ministerial positions under Labour, was widely seen as the natural choice.That received wisdom was upended during the Labour leadership contest, when commentators predicted the influx of new members into the party over the summer of ""Corbynmania"" could play into Mr Khan's hands. He would take some flak over his role in Jeremy Corbyn's election as party leader, as he nominated him but later voted for Andy Burnham. In the event, however, Mr Khan came out top as Labour choice of candidate not just with new members but in all three groups who could vote. It was a remarkable victory which, as the BBC's Norman Smith observed on the day, surprised him as much as it did his rivals.The campaign that ensued was bloody. A former aide to long-time Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, Ayesha Hazarika, reflected that when Zac Goldsmith - who had a reputation for being decent, attractive and independent-minded - was first picked as the Conservative candidate there was despondency in Labour ranks.Mr Khan said himself at one hustings that he thought his opponent had been a ""nice guy until [Conservative strategist] Sir Lynton Crosby got his hands on him"". Whoever came up with the approach, Mr Goldsmith's campaign focused heavily on portraying Mr Khan as an associate of ""extremists"" - which in turn allowed Labour to attack the Conservatives for pursuing ""divisive, dog-whistle"" tactics. Mr Khan took this to be an attempt to smear him by association because of his religion. The Conservatives insisted they were talking about his brand of left-wing politics - but Mr Goldsmith repeatedly said the Labour candidate had ""given platform, oxygen and cover to extremists"".It became a source of such bitter tension between the two camps that when David Cameron stuck up for Mr Goldsmith's campaign at prime minister's questions he found the word ""racist"" flung back at him from the Labour benches.While polls consistently suggested Mr Khan was ahead, Labour pessimists and Conservative optimists would remind themselves that Mr Goldsmith was likely to benefit from a Tory incumbency, from lower turnout among groups that tended to vote Labour, and from the under-reporting of Conservative support seen at the 2015 general election.But those things were not enough - or proved not to be the case at all. Voter turnout was 45%, an increase of 7% on 2012, and it was clear quite early on in the day that Mr Khan had a healthy lead over his Conservative rival.Another London Labour MP born to immigrant parents, David Lammy, told the BBC Mr Khan's election was a ""huge moment"" and predicted: ""If we ever see a black or Asian prime minister in this country I have no doubt they will owe an enormous debt to Sadiq Khan.""Now, the boy from Tooting will have to prove himself all over again. Love them or loathe them, the mayor's predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone - the only other men to have done the job - are political heavyweights. Even within his own party, Mr Khan has been accused of lacking vision. The perception of him as inexperienced also lingers on.One close Labour ally pointed out that ""unlike Ken, he has held ministerial office - but more than that, he represents the future. Unlike Boris he'll be wholly focused on getting results for London - this isn't just a stepping stone for his career"".She predicted he would be anxious to make good on the ambitious promises he made during the campaign, particularly on addressing London's housing problems.If that were not enough to be getting on with, he faces a dilemma over how to navigate between co-operating with the Conservative government and teaming up with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in condemnation of the Tories.In this respect he may hope to repeat the tactics of Boris Johnson, who managed to pull off alternately angering and assisting the government. If he is to succeed he will need to display the same knack for steering his own course as he has shown as a schoolboy, a campaigning lawyer, a backbench MP and a shadow minister.But those who voted for him will not forget his emphasis on his own disadvantaged background, his speeches about social justice and his promise to be a ""mayor for all Londoners""."
2016-05-06,Independence loss,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36227731,"It never feels good for any politician to wake up the morning after an election defeat. Today it's hard to imagine many senior Labour figures got much sleep at all last night. No doubt lying awake contemplating their humiliating defeat by the Tories who knocked them decisively into third place. But also having to ask deeper existential questions about whether there is still a place for the Labour party in the Scottish political landscape.Labour can spend the next few days and weeks asking if it was their polices that voters didn't like. Was it a mistake to offer to raise income tax for almost every taxpayer in Scotland? Was it their young and inexperienced leader who has only been in the job nine short months? Was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership a factor?But arguments over their manifesto or personalities are to miss the point. This election was clearly about the constitution. Scottish politics are still totally dominated by the independence question which was certainly not settled on 18 September 2014 and still seems to take precedence in voters' minds over any other issue. And it's an issue on which Labour cannot win.""We have to get our story straight on where we stand on independence"", is what very depressed Labour figures were telling me on Thursday night. But they had different ideas about what that story should be.Labour can never form another government in Holyrood or win back many of their Westminster seats unless they appeal to former Labour voters who have now decided they favour an independent Scotland and are currently voting SNP. But what we learned last night was that if Labour don't take a hard line on their support for the union they haemorrhage votes to the Tories. Labour tried to reach out to Yes voters by saying that if there was another referendum Labour politicians would be free to campaign on either side. Kezia Dugdale even suggested in one interview that she might consider voting for independence in the event of a Brexit but then tried to row back from that - whilst also saying that she resolutely opposed the idea of having another referendum and would vigorously campaign for a no vote if there was to be another indyref.That left space for the Tories to proclaim themselves the only true party of the Union. They accused Labour of being soft on independence and it seems to have worked. The roughly 10% of voters the Tories seem to have grabbed from Labour are largely unionists who wanted to express their opposition to independence at the ballot box once more. So where does that leave Labour? If the SNP are the party of independence and the Tories the party of the union, what is the point of the Labour Party? They will continue to argue that they care most about social justice and poverty. But as long as voters remain split over the constitution that may not win back many voters.   One small consolation for Scottish labour leader Kezia Dugdale - it seems unlikely she will face a leadership challenge even despite this terrible result. Why? Partly because Labour have finally realised changing leaders every time they lose an election hasn't helped. But mostly because no-one wants the job of Scottish labour leader right now. And who can blame them?"
2016-05-06,Political maps,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36215186,"What impact have the elections had on the political maps of London, Scotland, Wales and England?In London, Labour's Sadiq Khan defeated Conservative Zac Goldsmith to become mayor. Khan came out on top in three constituencies that had voted for former mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012. After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%.The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.Of the 14 London Assembly seats, Labour won nine, taking Merton and Wandsworth from the Conservatives, who held five boroughs.The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six, and the Lib Dems five.  Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour. But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP. The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies. The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament. That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.  Labour is likely to hang on to power in Wales, with just one constituency changing hands, as Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party. The biggest shift in Welsh politics overnight is the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	Although UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third. In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent. Voters in some parts in England have also been choosing their local councillors. A total of 124 councils are up for re-election, in part or in whole. After 115 results had been announced, Labour had lost 24 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, which is now under no overall control. The Conservatives had lost a total of 33 council seats, having been up on their previous total earlier, but have not lost control of any of the 28 councils up for re-election. The Lib Dems had gained 35 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control. UKIP had 26 more council seats - but had not been able to convert these gains into control of any council. At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.

        	In general, turnout was significantly lower in Wales, but it was highest at 56.8% in Cardiff North where Labour won with about 45% of the vote and Brecon and Radnorshire where the Lib Dems took more than half of the vote. The biggest increase in turnout in Wales was in the Rhondda, the only constituency seat that changed hands.

2016-05-06,Corbyn's future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36223968,"They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable.But the results were messier than they predicted.So when Jo Cox - the Batley MP who nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership to broaden the party's debate - says that Labour should have performed better at these elections, she has logic and precedence on her side. The party fared less well than the last time many of these seats were contested, in 2012, and Labour still went on to lose the subsequent general election.But it's not clear that the results provide enough ammunition for those who want to take aim at the leadership. Mr Corbyn's supporters will point out the party didn't hold on just in its northern heartlands, but in areas where it expected to lose - right down on the south coast, in Southampton and Hastings.His internal critics have been pointing out privately all night that beneath the surface, some of the results aren't anything to write home about. Labour retained overall control in Nuneaton for example, but lost ground to the Conservatives.  Crucially, though, the party's deputy leader Tom Watson made it clear he wasn't sanctioning any coup attempt with Mr Corbyn, who has been in the job for only eight months. He didn't think either winning - or losing - 100 seats should prove decisive, and he will have in mind that members and supporters who elected the Labour leader last September are unlikely to have been appalled at results which saw Labour retain control of Crawley. Since the 2014 referendum, Scotland tends to be viewed through a different prism. Unlike in England, Labour has to compete against another party describing itself as social-democratic: the SNP.But elsewhere in the UK, some Labour MPs, if not the new supporters of the party, will ask if there are lessons to be learnt from campaigning unsuccessfully on a platform of higher taxes for better public services.But a better guide to Labour's current weakness might be the Conservatives' strength.A governing party tearing itself apart from the grassroots to the cabinet table over Britain's relationship with the EU certainly looks like it will suffer some setbacks, notably in London.But it is on course for ending up with an increased tally of councillors - and very possibly becoming the official opposition in Scotland after years in the political wilderness.

2016-05-06,Team Khan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-london-36226252,"If many Londoners knew little about Sadiq Khan until this contest, it is likely they will know even less about the team that will help him govern at City Hall if he wins.Every mayor has the right to appoint two political advisers and up to 10 other staff, giving them a chance to surround themselves with trusted lieutenants and a chance to hit the ground running.So who might form Sadiq Khan's team to help him carry through on his campaign promises?It's likely the man who ran his campaign, David Bellamy, will continue as Khan's right-hand man as his chief of staff.And helping to deliver on the big issue of the election - housing - it's likely Mr Khan will stick with James Murray, an Islington councillor who advised the campaign on housing and stood in at debates for Mr Khan.There may also be a return to City Hall for Neale Coleman, an advisor to both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. Heavily involved in delivery the Olympics and its legacy, he briefly worked as head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn.Seen as capable and pragmatic, he's likely to have a role in settling Team Khan into the eight-floor offices. Another name being touted is that of Andrew Adonis - a former cabinet minister and currently the head of the National Infrastructure Commission.With big projects like Crossrail 2 and HS2 coming down the track, his expertise could prove key, but it may require him to walk away from the national job.If he's looking for a deputy mayor for policing, the smart money seems to be on current Assembly member Joanne McCartney, a trained barrister and Labour member for Enfield and Haringey, who has chaired the assembly's Police and Crime Committee.Fiona Twycross, who has worked on the Fire Authority, may also be rewarded.Former Bethnal Green MP Oona King, who backed Mr Khan when he first announced he was running, may enter City Hall in a communities role.Expect roles too for policy director Nick Bowes - widely seen as the ideas person behind the new mayor's campaign - and Leah Kreitzman and Jack Stenner, who have been key members of team Khan since he became Labour's candidate.Ex-journalist Patrick Hennessy, who ran communications for Mr Khan during the election campaign, is likely to continue selling the message."

That ""suggests that the statement in the government leaflet is not significantly affected by it"".It may seem odd that the impact is so small, given that the Netherlands is the third biggest customer for UK exports, behind the USA and Germany. But remember that the Rotterdam Effect only affects exports of goods, while the 44% figure is for both goods and services.Sir Andrew did suggest that a more prominent note in the statistics about the Rotterdam Effect would be helpful. In evidence to the parliamentary committee chaired by  Bernard Jenkin, he said that would be particularly important to people interested in the level of exports to the Netherlands rather than the whole EU.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"

""We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security, as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.""BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Khan's comments would be seen as a message not just to Jeremy Corbyn but also to the Labour leader's critics.As he took office as London mayor in a ceremony in Southwark Cathedral, Mr Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants, promised to ""make our city better"" and be ""a mayor for all Londoners"".He also pledged to lead ""the most transparent, engaged and accessible administration London has ever seen"".The former Labour minister's victory in London ends eight years of Conservative control of City Hall.Mr Corbyn welcomed Mr Rees' victory, saying in a tweet: ""Another Labour mayor who will stand up for their city!""But the Labour leader was absent from Mr Khan's swearing-in ceremony earlier on Saturday, travelling instead to Bristol to congratulate that city's new mayor Marvin Rees. ""I am meeting Sadiq over the weekend, I have been in touch with him. We are getting on fine. I have sent him a message of congratulations,"" the Labour leader said.In other results from Thursday's election, Nicola Sturgeon's SNP party celebrated its third successive victory in the Holyrood election - though the result left the SNP two seats short of a majority in the parliament.In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionists remain the biggest party in the Assembly, with Arlene Foster continuing as first minister.In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs.Labour's vote share was down about 6% on average on 2012 - the last time the seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, and Plaid Cymru is up by two points. UKIP increased its vote by 12 points and saw seven candidates elected.The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. The Sadiq Khan story"

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.""Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions""."
2016-05-07,Hamilton bid to lead UKIP in assembly,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-wales-36233182,"Neil Hamilton is expected to challenge Nathan Gill to lead UKIP's new assembly group, sources have told BBC Wales.The former Tory MP has denied a suggestion by a senior UKIP source that he will try to change party rules giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage sole power to appoint the leader in Wales. Current UKIP rules allow different politicians to lead the assembly group and the party in Wales.A source close to Mr Gill said he was confident most UKIP AMs would back him.Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill were among seven new UKIP AMs elected on Thursday.Gareth Bennett, Mark Reckless, David Rowlands and Mr Gill took the oath of office at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay on Saturday.Mr Hamilton and another newly-elected AM - Caroline Jones - were present but were not sworn in.Party sources expect Mr Hamilton to make the leadership challenge on Tuesday to Mr Gill, who was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Mr Farage in 2014. Mr Hamilton and Ms Jones are expected to take the oath on Tuesday morning, after attending a meeting of UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday.At the meeting they will stand down from the NEC, which is required under UKIP's rules now that they have become elected politicians.A senior UKIP source suggested Mr Hamilton might use the meeting to attempt to change party rules stating that UKIP's national leader has the sole power to appoint the party's leader in Wales.Mr Hamilton has denied he has such a plan.Earlier on Saturday, Mr Hamilton told BBC Radio Wales that UKIP AMs would agree next week who should lead their group.He stressed that Mr Gill was not automatically in charge and said there were ""many people in UKIP"" with the right skills for the the job.  ""We're going to have a collective discussion when we all meet together and we'll come up with a decision as to which of us is likely to be the most effective leader in the assembly,"" he said.Asked if he would be the best candidate, Mr Hamilton added: ""I, of course, have a lot of parliamentary experience and so has [fellow UKIP AM and ex-Tory MP] Mark Reckless.""I've been around in politics for a very long time at quite a high level, and we have many people in UKIP who've got the kind of skills which will be advantageous to a leader.   ""But I'm not going to pre-empt the discussions that we will have, probably on Tuesday.""First Minister Carwyn Jones is spending the weekend preparing to form a new government, after Labour won 29 of the 60 seats, losing just one to Plaid.The new assembly is expected to hold its first meeting next week. Discussions are ongoing between the parties to decide who should be presiding officer and deputy presiding officer, and take charge of assembly proceedings.The Conservative assembly group will meet on Monday to discuss strategy, after a disappointing election under Welsh leader Andrew RT Davies.The party failed to win any target seats and lost three to fall into third place behind Plaid Cymru.Monmouth AM Nick Ramsay said the Conservatives' problems could not be ""brushed under the table"" and the leadership needed to be discussed.He called it a ""difficult"" campaign but backed Mr Davies.""The 11 of us that are now left need to look at where we go from here,"" he said.""[We need to] decide how we get there and then look at all issues, including the leadership, but other issues as well such as the strategy the group adopts.""A Welsh Conservative spokesman described the campaign as ""very positive"" and ""ambitious"" with ""great ideas"".""There's a fifth party in play now, which has affected everyone else,"" he said, referring to UKIP.""We've proven we can challenge in key seats next time around.""Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party would be ""constructive but playing the crucial role of a strong opposition"" to Labour. ""We will use that wisely to put forward a vision for the country which is as clear now as it was the day before the election,"" he said.Kirsty Williams, the only surviving Lib Dem AM, has resigned as leader of the party in Wales after it lost four of its five Senedd seats.Labour looks likely to form another minority Labour administration after an election in which only one constituency changed hands.And yet, the election has revealed a big change in Welsh politics - a change that has arrived in Cardiff Bay in the form of seven UKIP AMs who won seats on the regional lists.They say they want to shake the place up. But Nigel Farage also says they want to play a constructive role.I'm not sure how you achieve both.Either way, there's a question facing UKIP - who will lead them in Wales?Nathan Gill was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Nigel Farage in 2014 - a job he's compared to ""herding cats"".It sounds as though Neil Hamilton - the former Tory MP whose political career has been re-booted by this election - would be only too happy to relieve him of his duty.But his elevation is unlikely to heal rifts in the party. Even the suggestion that he could be a candidate in this election caused a row in UKIP's ranks."
2016-05-07,Doctors to decide on NHS contract talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36234731,"Junior doctor representatives at the British Medical Association (BMA) will meet later to decide whether to hold talks with the government over a disputed new NHS employment contract.Negotiations over the contract broke down in February and junior doctors have staged several strikes since then.Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they could focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours.The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says there should be no preconditions.The government says it is willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA agreed in principle to the idea of restarting talks and also to a possible deferral of any new threat of strikes for five days.BBC health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be ""clarity about the next steps by the end of the day"".  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday."" Mr Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continue discussions.Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.Last week, there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS."

The final count in Upper Bann ended on Saturday afternoon.Northern Ireland Assembly election resultsThe DUP has 38 seats, while Sinn Féin has 28, the Ulster Unionists 16, SDLP 12 and the Alliance Party eight.The Greens and People Before Profit Alliance have two seats each. The TUV leader Jim Allister remains its sole representative.In terms of the last assembly, the DUP holds the same number of seats and Sinn Féin has dropped one seat.It has been a difficult election for both the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.In the end, the Ulster Unionists ended up with the same number of seats as before, but the SDLP lost two seats, one in Foyle and the other, after a marathon counting session, was Dolores Kelly's seat in Upper Bann.DUP leader Mrs Foster said: ""I'm absolutely delighted with the mandate that my party has been given to drive forward Northern Ireland into the future."" ""Of course, people have spoken and they have spoken very clearly.""Looking at the Sinn Féin strategy in this election, Gerry Kelly said: ""I think what we will do is take it constituency by constituency and look at vote management and all of the rest of it. I think, to a great extent, that the vote management wasn't that bad.""Moments from count centres across Northern IrelandHe said his part knew that Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit would take the seat in West Belfast.""We agree with what a lot of what People Before Profit say. There are some things we disagree with. We said we would work with them in the south and we will certainly work with them in the north."" UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said his party's campaign had been neither a success, nor a failure. He said the party would return 16 seats, the same as in 2011, but signalled a ""change of personnel"".SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had been left with ""a lot of work to do"".  ""All of us need to learn lessons that Stormont is not delivering and people are not happy about that,"" he said.""We've had a rough couple of years, we've begun to change the face of the party and we're going to build from here.""BBC's Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler's view of the future assembly Alliance Party leader David Ford said his party had had a ""safe enough election compared to other parties"" and he was now concerned about shaping a programme for government that's ""inclusive and will promote the needs of all people in Northern Ireland"".Gerry Carroll won People Before Profit's first ever assembly seat in West Belfast at the expense of Sinn Féin.Anti-austerity party picks up seatsHe was followed by his colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann who took a seat from the SDLP in Foyle to secure his place at Stormont.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.The DUP's Frank McCoubrey came within 89 votes of winning a first unionist seat in West Belfast since the 2003 election, but he just lost out to Alex Attwood of the SDLP.Jim Allister retained his North Antrim seat for the Traditional Unionist Voice and Claire Bailey secured one for the Green Party in South Belfast.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt came out on top in the Strangford poll.But he said his pre-election prediction of the number of seats his party would win had been ""ambitious"".Naomi Long will return to Stormont for the Alliance Party, winning in East Belfast a year after she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP in the same constituency.Passing the 30 seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.But it lost a seat to Jenny Palmer, one of its former councillors who left the party last year after claiming she had been bullied. She was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.West Tyrone declared its first seat on Saturday - the SDLP's Daniel McCrossan - after the eighth count.Several MLAs from the previous assembly will not be returning to Stormont, with the independent John McCallister, the DUP's Ian McCrea and Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin among the most high-profile figures to lose their seats.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates stood in Thursday's election, with 108 seats in Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies up for grabs.In all, 703,744 people voted, and the turnout of 54.91% was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation, and about 2,000 count staff have been working at eight centres across Northern Ireland."
2016-05-07,Unions hail scrapping of academy plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36234989,"Teaching unions have welcomed the government's decision to ditch plans to force all state schools in England to become academies.  They said the move was recognition that ""one size"" did not fit all schools.Ministers said the government had listened to critics but the goal to turn schools into academies remained. Schools judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding will now not have to become academies, nor will small rural schools have to join a multi-academy trust.  The forced academisation proposals had been opposed by some Conservative MPs and councillors, as well as by unions and others. The government argues that academies drive up standards by giving more power to head teachers and allowing them to be more innovative. Critics have contended that academisation amounts to privatising the education system and say it is simplistic to say academies raise standards. Cabinet minister Michael Fallon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have now decided, having listened to parents and governors and our backbenchers that there is a better route to it, which is not forcing every school immediately to become an academy.""He said academisation would now focus only on schools that were ""clearly failing"".Asked whether ministers had tried to ""bury"" the announcement on a busy day for news, Mr Fallon said it would not have been ""legally"" possible to issue it in the preceding days because of the ""purdah"" restrictions on the activities of civil servants in election periods. Paul Luxmoore, executive head teacher of the Coastal Academies Trust in Kent, told Today he was ""dismayed"" at the policy reversal.""We've reached the tipping point, where local authorities - who have been delivering school improvements to schools until now - no longer have the capacity, or the money to do that effectively. Hence the government policy to make all schools academies over the next four years was entirely predictable and entirely sensible,"" he said.""I think they've lost their courage to go ahead with it because of all sorts of other political reasons [that have] very little to do with education.""Andy Miller, head teacher at St Nicholas Church of England Primary School in Blackpool, said the forced academisation plan had been a mistake. ""I would argue that head teachers, their governing bodies and their parent community actually know what's best for individual schools - rather than somebody in Westminster saying this is good for all of you,"" he said.National Association of Head Teachers president Kim Johnson said his organisation wanted ministers to understand ""that actually there isn't a case of one size fits all"" for schools. ""We're the intelligent practitioners and we want that opportunity, at the table with government, to further those discussions."" Tory backbencher Graham Brady, who welcomed the abandonment of the plans, said that ""the more that we can have these debates and discussions before legislation is brought forward, the better"".Alasdair Smith, from campaign group Anti Academies Alliance, said: ""We've known for more than 30 years exactly what improves schools, and it's not rocket science, it's high quality teaching and learning and good leadership. ""The government has not been pursuing that agenda, they've been pursuing structural change, and they've ignored high quality teaching, and high quality leadership, and that's why the policy is now in tatters.""Academies are independently run - but state-funded - schools, overseen by a not-for-profit business, known as an academy trust. They are often part of a chain.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said scrapping the plans was ""frankly a humiliating climbdown for David Cameron and his education secretary"".However, the government said it would push forward with compelling academy conversions in two areas:The government also announced measures to protect small rural schools including extra financial support and a requirement that any closure would have to be agreed by the local authority and the regional schools commissioner."
2016-05-07,SNP celebrate - as Labour 'hang on',https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36218450,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has downplayed talk of another independence referendum after winning the party's third election victory in a row.Confirming she would form a minority government at Holyrood, she said her aim was to ""persuade, not to divide"". Despite Labour coming third in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party had ""hung on"" and done better than expected in Wales and England.Sadiq Khan leads the London Mayoral election as counting continues.With all the results declared in Scotland, the SNP is the largest party with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24.Labour remains the dominant party in Wales, winning 29 out of 60 seats, but falling just short of a majority. Plaid Cymru pipped the Tories to be the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly while UKIP won seven seats on a good night for the party.Counting continues across English councils but the BBC is forecasting that, on the basis of the results so far, Labour would have got a 31% projected share of the national vote, with the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.Elections expert John Curtice said the result - calculated on the basis the UK electorate as a whole had behaved in the same way as voters did in the English local elections - was slightly better than Labour might have expected.In the London Mayoral race, a live update of the vote tally shows Labour candidate Sadiq Khan currently ahead of his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. In Northern Ireland, the first results for the assembly election are being declared with the final result due on Saturday. Tap here to search for election results in your area.Speaking in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said that despite falling two seats short of a majority, the SNP had secured an ""emphatic"" victory and had a ""clear and unequivocal"" mandate. She said the party would govern on its own rather than in alliance with other parties. On the issue of a future vote on independence, she said the SNP will make ""our case with passion, with patience but will always respect the opinion of the people"".But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said any prospect of the issue being reopened in the next five years had been ""utterly shredded"" by the SNP's failure to win a majority. Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.But nor is there much evidence of enthusiasm for the Conservative government in England. The Tories so far have picked up a handful of seats, traditionally an achievement for a party in power at these kinds of polls.But for success, and unexpected success, the Conservatives can look to Scotland where it appears they are set to take second place, - a fundamental change in Scotland. But there, voters again expressed their faith and belief in the Scottish National Party as their government.Read more from LauraIn the English council elections, BBC analysis suggests the Tory vote fell in southern England, which may have helped Labour to retain control of councils in areas such as Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where its vote was looking vulnerable.Labour's vote share is down about 6% on average on 2012  - the last time these seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But a BBC analysis suggests its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.Its share was more sharply down in Scotland. The party gained one seat from the SNP - Edinburgh Southern - but failed to take other targets and was beaten into third place by the Conservatives - a result that would have been unthinkable in the past.Labour also lost its Rhondda Welsh Assembly seat, in its south Wales heartlands, to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In other developments:Brighter news for Labour came with it holding the seat of Sheffield Brightside in a Westminster by-election, with UKIP coming second. The party also held Ogmore in another Parliamentary by-election, in South Wales, with UKIP again in second place. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Corbyn said it had ""grown support"" in parts of England but he acknowledged the scale of the defeat in Scotland, saying there was a ""lot of building"" to do. Amid speculation about Mr Corbyn's future, his deputy Tom Watson said he needed ""more time"" to show he could revive Labour fortunes.But MP Michael Dugher said Labour was ""not on a trajectory"" to victory in 2020 while shadow scottish secretary Ian Murray suggested the public did not see Labour ""at the moment as being a credible party of future government"". For the Conservatives, the highlights of the evening were in Scotland, winning the Holyrood seat of Eastwood from Labour and Ruth Davidson's winning Edinburgh Central from the SNP.David Cameron said the party's second place in Scotland and its showing in England, where it took control of Peterborough Council and won council seats in key Westminster marginals such as Dudley and Nuneaton, represented a good result for a party in government for six years.""Local election day for sitting prime ministers is supposed to be a day of dread, waiting for the knock on the door like a condemned man waiting for a hangman,"" he said. ""But that's wasn't what it was like last night.""In a surprise result in Wales, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood unseated Labour's Leighton Andrews in the Rhondda - described by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain as ""a terrible shock for us in Welsh Labour"".Ms Wood said: ""A new dawn has already broken over the Valleys, people have voted for change.""In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, while Plaid Cymru is up by two points.The big story of the night in Wales was the performance of UKIP, which saw its vote increase by 12 points. The party's leader Nigel Farage hailed it as a significant breakthrough. In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs.

has passed the 30-seats mark after the first day of counting in the Northern Ireland Assembly election.Three-quarters of the 108 seats have been filled, with the DUP on 33.Eleven constituencies have been fully declared, and counting has ended for the night in seven areas.So far, Sinn Féin has 19 seats, Ulster Unionists have 10, the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) has nine and the Alliance Party has six.Passing the 30-seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.Gerry Carroll won a first ever assembly seat for the People Before Profit Alliance, topping the poll in West Belfast for the left-wing party to take one of the five seats Sinn Féin had held in the constituency.The SDLP's Alex Attwood retained his West Belfast seat by a narrow margin, overcoming DUP challenger Frank McCoubrey by just 89 votes.Mr Carroll said his success was evidence that voters had become ""fed-up with the status quo"" and were ""looking for a political alternative"".He was joined by his party colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann, who was elected in Foyle, taking a seat from the SDLP.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in his home constituency of Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat when he was eliminated after the first count, but he said his his nine years as an MLA had been a ""privilege"".He was twice elected as an Ulster Unionist but left the party in 2013 to form the ill-fated NI21, which imploded just over a year later.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said he was ""stunned"" to top the Strangford poll, but acknowledged that he had been ""ambitious"" with his prediction of the number of seats his party would win.Alliance Party leader David Ford crossed the line in South Antrim and Jim Allister, who leads the Traditional Unionist Voice, was re-elected in North Antrim.Former MP Naomi Long will return to frontline politics after her election for the Alliance Party in East Belfast, where she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP last year.The DUP's Joanne Bunting has taken the East Belfast seat vacated by former first minister Peter Robinson, who retired earlier this year.In South Belfast, the city's former lord mayor Máirtín Ó Muilleoir was elected after topping the poll and Claire Bailey gained a seat in the constituency for the Green Party, saying she wanted to ""change the conversation at Stormont"".The DUP also made a gain in the constituency, with councillor Christopher Stalford taking the seat that had been held by the UUP.Jenny Palmer, a councillor who left the DUP last year after claiming she had been bullied, took a seat off her former party when she was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.Former agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew, who left the assembly to serve as an MP, will return to Stormont after her election for Sinn Féin in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.William Irwin of the DUP came top of the poll Newry and Armagh, while former Armagh gaelic footballer Justin McNulty will be another new face in the assembly for the SDLP after securing his party's single seat in the constituency.Three Sinn Féin candidates came through in Mid Ulster, but the DUP's McCrea dynasty came to an end when Ian, the son of former MP and MLA William, lost his seat to party colleague Keith Buchanan.Former health minister Jim Wells, who has endured a series of controversies in the past two years, was re-elected in South Down.He made a formal complaint to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland after his wife and the husband of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) candidate Sinéad Bradley were denied entry to the count.The leaders of the two largest parties in Northern Ireland will be delighted by the results so far.The DUP is on course to hold the seats it took in 2011 and Sinn Féin are hopeful they will better their 2011 election when they won 29 seats.In contrast, it has been a disappointing day for the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates have been competing across Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies.In all, 703,744 people voted in the election, representing a turnout of 54.91%, which was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.In general terms, turnout in eastern constituencies has increased compared to 2011, but dropped in western constituencies.More than 2,000 staff are involved in counting the votes in eight centres across Northern Ireland.In Northern Ireland, MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation.Seven counts will resume on Saturday morning, with the final seats not due to be declared later in the day."
2016-05-07,Police probe Tory election expenses,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36231138,"Eight police forces are investigating whether Conservative MPs filed election expenses illegally after the 2015 General Election, the BBC understands.The allegations centre around failing to register the accommodation costs of party activists who were involved in the ""battle bus"" operation. The party has blamed an ""administrative error"".A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.The activists on the party's battle bus targeted marginal seats. The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.Failing to file correct expenses is a criminal offence.The eight forces actively investigating are West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, Greater Manchester Police, Devon and Cornwall Police, Gloucestershire Police, Northamptonshire Police, Staffordshire Police, and Cheshire Police.A further four forces are waiting for further information, the BBC understands.Police can investigate such claims up to a year after the election expenses were filed, and West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, and Greater Manchester Police have started the process of getting extensions to the time limit.A Conservative spokesperson said: ""As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus. ""However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return.  ""The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. ""Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning.""The Electoral Commission - which is an independent body that sets standards for running elections - is also investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act during the general election.The Commission has powers in relation to national campaign spending, although its sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance at the Electoral Commission, said: ""The police and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. ""We have requested that they consider doing this."" "

We didn't.""We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places.""He congratulated the ""hard work"" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: ""There is a lot of building to do in Scotland. ""We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again.""They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a ""weak leader"" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as ""shocking"". The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.""We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats,"" Tim Roache, its general secretary said. ""Let's give it a go. Let's give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen? Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day. Who knows.""But Mr McDonnell told critics to ""get behind the leader of the Labour Party that was democratically elected"".He added: ""I think most Labour Party members are saying 'look, you're damaging our campaign by the continuous carping'.""I've never been in a situation where, two days before a poll, a group of them are talking to the media about a leadership coup - and yet we still do well.""Former Labour minister Lord Falconer urged the party to focus ""outwards"" following a row over anti-Semitism involving the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.""There's real issues that need to be dealt with, but this idea of a divided party makes the Labour party despair and the public despair,"" he added."

2016-05-07,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-07,The Sadiq Khan story,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36140479,"Labour's Sadiq Khan has been elected as London's new mayor - but who is the man who will be in charge of the UK's capital city for the next four years?Sadiq Khan's life to date has been characterised by beating the odds - which is what he has just done to become mayor of London.When Labour politicians put themselves forward to run for mayor last year, Mr Khan was far from being the favourite. The bookies' money was on Baroness Jowell, a veteran of the Tony Blair years who had helped bring the Olympics to London. But if there is a pattern in Mr Khan's career, it's one of coming from behind. The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. Age: 45Marital status: Married with two daughtersPolitical party: LabourTime as MP: Has represented Tooting in south London since 2005Previous jobs: Human rights solicitor, chair of Liberty""Son of a bus driver"" became one of the most hackneyed phrases in Mr Khan's time on the stump - so overused in his leaflets and speeches that he was eventually forced to make fun of his own campaign, joking he had given the Daily Mirror an ""exclusive"" on his background. But his parents' story holds real significance for him. Amanullah and Sehrun Khan emigrated from Pakistan to London shortly before Sadiq was born, in 1970. He was the fifth of their eight children - seven sons and a daughter. He has often said that his early impressions of the world of work shaped his belief in the trade union movement. His father, a bus driver for 25 years, ""was in a union and got decent pay and conditions"" whereas his mum, a stay-at-home seamstress, ""wasn't, and didn't"".He lived with his parents and siblings in a cramped three-bedroomed house on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield, south-west London, sharing a bunkbed with one of his brothers until he left home in his 20s. He attended the local comprehensive, Ernest Bevin College, which he describes as ""a tough school - it wasn't always a bed of roses"". The nickname ""Bevin boys"" was at that time in that part of south London a byword for bad behaviour.It was at school that he first began to gravitate towards politics, joining the Labour Party aged 15. He credits the school's head, Naz Bokhari, who happened to be the first Muslim headteacher at a UK secondary school, with making him realise ""skin colour or background wasn't a barrier to making something with your life"".Mr Khan was raised a Muslim and has never shied away from acknowledging the importance of his faith. In his maiden speech as an MP he spoke about his father teaching him Mohammed's sayings, or hadiths - in particular the principle that ""if one sees something wrong, one has the duty to try to change it"".He was an able student who loved football, boxing and cricket - he even had a trial for Surrey County Cricket Club as a teenager. He has since spoken about the racist abuse he and his brothers faced at Wimbledon and Chelsea football matches, saying he felt ""safer"" watching at home and became a Liverpool fan simply ""because they were playing such great football at the time"".He studied maths and science at A-level with the idea of becoming a dentist. He was switched on to law by a teacher who told him ""you're always arguing"" - and by the TV programme LA Law, starring Jimmy Smits as Victor Sifuentes, a charismatic partner in a California law firm.""LA law was about lawyers in LA who do great cases, act for the underdog, drove nice cars, look great and I wanted to be Sifuentes,"" Mr Khan told Business Insider recently.He studied law at the University of North London and put his degree to good use straight away, becoming a trainee solicitor in 1994 at Christian Fisher under the human rights lawyer Louise Christian. The same year he met and married his wife Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor and coincidentally the daughter of a bus driver - with whom he went on to have two daughters, Anisah and Ammarah. He also began his 12-year stint as a councillor for Tooting, encouraged by Guyanan-born local activist Bert Luthers.Just three years later, aged 27, he was made an equity partner and the firm was renamed Christian Khan.During this time he worked on a number of high-profile cases: he won compensation for Kenneth Hsu, a hairdresser wrongly arrested and assaulted by the police; teachers and lawyers who had experienced racial discrimination; Leroy Logan, a senior black police officer accused of fraud; corrupt former Met Police commander Ali Dizaei; and helped overturn an exclusion order (later upheld on appeal) on US political activist Louis Farrakhan.The irony of a man who represented people in cases against the Met going on to become the force's chief scrutineer has not been lost on his opponents. Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith, speaking at an event alongside Home Secretary Theresa May, recently characterised Mr Khan's legal career as ""coaching people in suing our police"".He left his law firm somewhat abruptly in 2004, afterwards telling the Law Gazette: ""If you're in government, you're a legislator and you have the opportunity to make laws that can improve things for millions of people.""In 2005, Mr Khan fought and retained the marginal seat of Tooting for Labour, one of five new ethnic minority MPs elected that year.Contemporaries on either side of the political divide remember being impressed by a ""fiercely bright"" and ""persuasive"" individual who was ""impossible not to listen to"". He combines that sharpness with what is often called his ""cheeky chappy"" demeanour. He is fond of calling people ""mate"" and has even done so on the floor of the Commons.Two months after he entered the Commons, he was thrust into the limelight by the 7 July bombings. When Parliament met to discuss the attacks, he told MPs: ""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted on Thursday; proud of the way ordinary courageous Londoners carried on with their business and stopped the criminals disrupting our life.""In a 2010 Guardian interview, he recalled thinking: ""I couldn't hide - and I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but there were so few articulate voices of reason from the British Muslim community. ""There were angry men with beards, but nobody saying, 'Actually, I'm very comfortable being a Brit, being a Muslim, being a Londoner'."" The intervention marked him out as one to watch, but his path to promotion was not altogether smooth. Mr Khan wore his civil liberties credentials on his sleeve, challenging the government over ID cards and joining 48 other Labour rebels to vote against prime minister Tony Blair's plan to allow the detention of terror suspects without charge for up to 90 days. He later claimed party chiefs had penalised him by preventing him from visiting Pakistan in the wake of an earthquake there and did not want to give him an office with a sofa.But the rebellion was not altogether to his disadvantage. Tony Blair was on his way out, and Mr Khan was able to position himself on the ascendant ""soft left"" of the Labour party alongside Ed Balls and Gordon Brown. ""It was a tough school; it wasn't always a bed of roses. But you become street wise, you become savvy and you learn social skills - you learn about how to deal with people."" - on his schooldays""The way allegations of misconduct against police officers are investigated is flawed and inadequate."" - as a human rights solicitor""Although I'd won cases at the European Court of Human Rights, and I'd won cases in the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal, I still couldn't escape the fact that if you're part of the legislature and the executive, you can make legislation that improves the quality of life for literally millions of people."" - on leaving law to become an MP""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted."" - on the 7/7 attacks""Most people feel nagged by their parents from time to time, but very rarely is it about the future of bus regulation."" - on his father ""I sleep in my own bed. When I get home I put the rubbish out and get my girls up to go to school."" - on staying grounded""For the last eight years you've seen a red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hand. I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners."" - on launching his mayoral bidWhen Gordon Brown took over at Number 10, Mr Khan was given his first job in government as a whip and then as communities minister, a move that created disquiet among some other MPs in the capital who had been around for longer.A post at the Department for Transport followed in 2009 and he became the first Muslim in the Cabinet. This was at a time when there were only four Muslim MPs and he was often confused for international development minister Shahid Malik.He would go on to claim during the mayoral campaign that as transport minister he had ""pushed"" Crossrail through Parliament, but the Mayorwatch website has shown Mr Khan only took on responsibility for the project after the relevant bill had become law. At the 2010 election, Mr Khan's own majority was squeezed to an uncomfortably small margin of just 2,524 votes and Labour was out of government for the first time in 13 years.In the chaotic months of Labour soul-searching that followed, he again showed a canny ability to ally himself with what was seemingly a lost cause and turn it into success.True to his Brownite colours, he was chosen as Ed Miliband's campaign manager and helped steer the less-favoured Miliband brother towards an unexpected leadership election victory.He told the New Statesman afterwards that the night before the result, he told Miliband to ""prepare for defeat"". ""I learned this from (television series) Rumpole of the Bailey,"" he said. ""Always tell your client he's going to lose because, if he loses, he's expecting it; if he wins, you're the fantastic lawyer who got the victory."" However, he added: ""I had a feeling we'd done it.""In that contest, as in the Labour mayoral nomination, Mr Khan's support for the trade union movement helped his campaign secure crucial votes.He was rewarded with the post of shadow justice secretary - a role in which he did not get off to an auspicious start. His first major speech was badly received when he chose to highlight Labour's failings in government, and in then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke he faced an adversary with whom he admitted he struggled to find things to disagree about.His other brief as shadow political reform minister did not provide much of a chance to shine either, as the coalition needed little help killing off its own proposals for Lords reform and his personal support for changes to the voting system was tempered by his view that the referendum on this - which saw the British public reject change - came at the wrong time.When Mr Clarke was sacked and replaced with Chris Grayling, however, Mr Khan was able to take the fight to the despatch box more convincingly as a vocal opponent of reforms to legal aid and restrictions on books in prisons.When the Conservatives later reversed several of Mr Grayling's flagship policies he described it as a ""huge climbdown"" that showed Labour had been right to resist them.Labour's disastrous showing in the 2015 election and the swift resignation of Ed Miliband - the man he had helped to the leadership - could have thrown Mr Khan off-course, but he found a new focus for his campaigning energy.Just a week after the election he announced he would seek the Labour nomination for mayor. He had already been tipped as a possible contender at least a year but, with typical shrewdness, he had steadfastly refused to be drawn on the subject in public while sounding out MPs and councillors in private to see if he had enough support.Once he had confirmed his mayoral ambitions, his quest for the nomination - let alone an election win - still seemed like a long shot. Baroness Jowell, who had been MP for Dulwich and West Norwood for 23 years and held a number of senior ministerial positions under Labour, was widely seen as the natural choice.That received wisdom was upended during the Labour leadership contest, when commentators predicted the influx of new members into the party over the summer of ""Corbynmania"" could play into Mr Khan's hands. He would take some flak over his role in Jeremy Corbyn's election as party leader, as he nominated him but later voted for Andy Burnham. In the event, however, Mr Khan came out top as Labour choice of candidate not just with new members but in all three groups who could vote. It was a remarkable victory which, as the BBC's Norman Smith observed on the day, surprised him as much as it did his rivals.The campaign that ensued was bloody. A former aide to long-time Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, Ayesha Hazarika, reflected that when Zac Goldsmith - who had a reputation for being decent, attractive and independent-minded - was first picked as the Conservative candidate there was despondency in Labour ranks.Mr Khan said himself at one hustings that he thought his opponent had been a ""nice guy until [Conservative strategist] Sir Lynton Crosby got his hands on him"". Whoever came up with the approach, Mr Goldsmith's campaign focused heavily on portraying Mr Khan as an associate of ""extremists"" - which in turn allowed Labour to attack the Conservatives for pursuing ""divisive, dog-whistle"" tactics. Mr Khan took this to be an attempt to smear him by association because of his religion. The Conservatives insisted they were talking about his brand of left-wing politics - but Mr Goldsmith repeatedly said the Labour candidate had ""given platform, oxygen and cover to extremists"".It became a source of such bitter tension between the two camps that when David Cameron stuck up for Mr Goldsmith's campaign at prime minister's questions he found the word ""racist"" flung back at him from the Labour benches.While polls consistently suggested Mr Khan was ahead, Labour pessimists and Conservative optimists would remind themselves that Mr Goldsmith was likely to benefit from a Tory incumbency, from lower turnout among groups that tended to vote Labour, and from the under-reporting of Conservative support seen at the 2015 general election.But those things were not enough - or proved not to be the case at all. Voter turnout was 45%, an increase of 7% on 2012, and it was clear quite early on in the day that Mr Khan had a healthy lead over his Conservative rival.Another London Labour MP born to immigrant parents, David Lammy, told the BBC Mr Khan's election was a ""huge moment"" and predicted: ""If we ever see a black or Asian prime minister in this country I have no doubt they will owe an enormous debt to Sadiq Khan.""Now, the boy from Tooting will have to prove himself all over again. Love them or loathe them, the mayor's predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone - the only other men to have done the job - are political heavyweights. Even within his own party, Mr Khan has been accused of lacking vision. The perception of him as inexperienced also lingers on.One close Labour ally pointed out that ""unlike Ken, he has held ministerial office - but more than that, he represents the future. Unlike Boris he'll be wholly focused on getting results for London - this isn't just a stepping stone for his career"".She predicted he would be anxious to make good on the ambitious promises he made during the campaign, particularly on addressing London's housing problems.If that were not enough to be getting on with, he faces a dilemma over how to navigate between co-operating with the Conservative government and teaming up with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in condemnation of the Tories.In this respect he may hope to repeat the tactics of Boris Johnson, who managed to pull off alternately angering and assisting the government. If he is to succeed he will need to display the same knack for steering his own course as he has shown as a schoolboy, a campaigning lawyer, a backbench MP and a shadow minister.But those who voted for him will not forget his emphasis on his own disadvantaged background, his speeches about social justice and his promise to be a ""mayor for all Londoners""."
2016-05-07,Independence loss,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36227731,"It never feels good for any politician to wake up the morning after an election defeat. Today it's hard to imagine many senior Labour figures got much sleep at all last night. No doubt lying awake contemplating their humiliating defeat by the Tories who knocked them decisively into third place. But also having to ask deeper existential questions about whether there is still a place for the Labour party in the Scottish political landscape.Labour can spend the next few days and weeks asking if it was their polices that voters didn't like. Was it a mistake to offer to raise income tax for almost every taxpayer in Scotland? Was it their young and inexperienced leader who has only been in the job nine short months? Was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership a factor?But arguments over their manifesto or personalities are to miss the point. This election was clearly about the constitution. Scottish politics are still totally dominated by the independence question which was certainly not settled on 18 September 2014 and still seems to take precedence in voters' minds over any other issue. And it's an issue on which Labour cannot win.""We have to get our story straight on where we stand on independence"", is what very depressed Labour figures were telling me on Thursday night. But they had different ideas about what that story should be.Labour can never form another government in Holyrood or win back many of their Westminster seats unless they appeal to former Labour voters who have now decided they favour an independent Scotland and are currently voting SNP. But what we learned last night was that if Labour don't take a hard line on their support for the union they haemorrhage votes to the Tories. Labour tried to reach out to Yes voters by saying that if there was another referendum Labour politicians would be free to campaign on either side. Kezia Dugdale even suggested in one interview that she might consider voting for independence in the event of a Brexit but then tried to row back from that - whilst also saying that she resolutely opposed the idea of having another referendum and would vigorously campaign for a no vote if there was to be another indyref.That left space for the Tories to proclaim themselves the only true party of the Union. They accused Labour of being soft on independence and it seems to have worked. The roughly 10% of voters the Tories seem to have grabbed from Labour are largely unionists who wanted to express their opposition to independence at the ballot box once more. So where does that leave Labour? If the SNP are the party of independence and the Tories the party of the union, what is the point of the Labour Party? They will continue to argue that they care most about social justice and poverty. But as long as voters remain split over the constitution that may not win back many voters.   One small consolation for Scottish labour leader Kezia Dugdale - it seems unlikely she will face a leadership challenge even despite this terrible result. Why? Partly because Labour have finally realised changing leaders every time they lose an election hasn't helped. But mostly because no-one wants the job of Scottish labour leader right now. And who can blame them?"
2016-05-07,Political maps,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36215186,"What impact have the elections had on the political maps of London, Scotland, Wales and England?In London, Labour's Sadiq Khan defeated Conservative Zac Goldsmith to become mayor. Khan came out on top in three constituencies that had voted for former mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012. After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%.The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.Of the 14 London Assembly seats, Labour won nine, taking Merton and Wandsworth from the Conservatives, who held five boroughs.The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six, and the Lib Dems five.  Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour. But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP. The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies. The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament. That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.  Labour is likely to hang on to power in Wales, with just one constituency changing hands, as Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party. The biggest shift in Welsh politics overnight is the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	Although UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third. In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent. Voters in some parts in England have also been choosing their local councillors. A total of 124 councils are up for re-election, in part or in whole. After 115 results had been announced, Labour had lost 24 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, which is now under no overall control. The Conservatives had lost a total of 33 council seats, having been up on their previous total earlier, but have not lost control of any of the 28 councils up for re-election. The Lib Dems had gained 35 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control. UKIP had 26 more council seats - but had not been able to convert these gains into control of any council. At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.

        	In general, turnout was significantly lower in Wales, but it was highest at 56.8% in Cardiff North where Labour won with about 45% of the vote and Brecon and Radnorshire where the Lib Dems took more than half of the vote. The biggest increase in turnout in Wales was in the Rhondda, the only constituency seat that changed hands.

2016-05-07,Corbyn's future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36223968,"They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable.But the results were messier than they predicted.So when Jo Cox - the Batley MP who nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership to broaden the party's debate - says that Labour should have performed better at these elections, she has logic and precedence on her side. The party fared less well than the last time many of these seats were contested, in 2012, and Labour still went on to lose the subsequent general election.But it's not clear that the results provide enough ammunition for those who want to take aim at the leadership. Mr Corbyn's supporters will point out the party didn't hold on just in its northern heartlands, but in areas where it expected to lose - right down on the south coast, in Southampton and Hastings.His internal critics have been pointing out privately all night that beneath the surface, some of the results aren't anything to write home about. Labour retained overall control in Nuneaton for example, but lost ground to the Conservatives.  Crucially, though, the party's deputy leader Tom Watson made it clear he wasn't sanctioning any coup attempt with Mr Corbyn, who has been in the job for only eight months. He didn't think either winning - or losing - 100 seats should prove decisive, and he will have in mind that members and supporters who elected the Labour leader last September are unlikely to have been appalled at results which saw Labour retain control of Crawley. Since the 2014 referendum, Scotland tends to be viewed through a different prism. Unlike in England, Labour has to compete against another party describing itself as social-democratic: the SNP.But elsewhere in the UK, some Labour MPs, if not the new supporters of the party, will ask if there are lessons to be learnt from campaigning unsuccessfully on a platform of higher taxes for better public services.But a better guide to Labour's current weakness might be the Conservatives' strength.A governing party tearing itself apart from the grassroots to the cabinet table over Britain's relationship with the EU certainly looks like it will suffer some setbacks, notably in London.But it is on course for ending up with an increased tally of councillors - and very possibly becoming the official opposition in Scotland after years in the political wilderness.

2016-05-07,Team Khan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-london-36226252,"If many Londoners knew little about Sadiq Khan until this contest, it is likely they will know even less about the team that will help him govern at City Hall if he wins.Every mayor has the right to appoint two political advisers and up to 10 other staff, giving them a chance to surround themselves with trusted lieutenants and a chance to hit the ground running.So who might form Sadiq Khan's team to help him carry through on his campaign promises?It's likely the man who ran his campaign, David Bellamy, will continue as Khan's right-hand man as his chief of staff.And helping to deliver on the big issue of the election - housing - it's likely Mr Khan will stick with James Murray, an Islington councillor who advised the campaign on housing and stood in at debates for Mr Khan.There may also be a return to City Hall for Neale Coleman, an advisor to both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. Heavily involved in delivery the Olympics and its legacy, he briefly worked as head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn.Seen as capable and pragmatic, he's likely to have a role in settling Team Khan into the eight-floor offices. Another name being touted is that of Andrew Adonis - a former cabinet minister and currently the head of the National Infrastructure Commission.With big projects like Crossrail 2 and HS2 coming down the track, his expertise could prove key, but it may require him to walk away from the national job.If he's looking for a deputy mayor for policing, the smart money seems to be on current Assembly member Joanne McCartney, a trained barrister and Labour member for Enfield and Haringey, who has chaired the assembly's Police and Crime Committee.Fiona Twycross, who has worked on the Fire Authority, may also be rewarded.Former Bethnal Green MP Oona King, who backed Mr Khan when he first announced he was running, may enter City Hall in a communities role.Expect roles too for policy director Nick Bowes - widely seen as the ideas person behind the new mayor's campaign - and Leah Kreitzman and Jack Stenner, who have been key members of team Khan since he became Labour's candidate.Ex-journalist Patrick Hennessy, who ran communications for Mr Khan during the election campaign, is likely to continue selling the message."

That ""suggests that the statement in the government leaflet is not significantly affected by it"".It may seem odd that the impact is so small, given that the Netherlands is the third biggest customer for UK exports, behind the USA and Germany. But remember that the Rotterdam Effect only affects exports of goods, while the 44% figure is for both goods and services.Sir Andrew did suggest that a more prominent note in the statistics about the Rotterdam Effect would be helpful. In evidence to the parliamentary committee chaired by  Bernard Jenkin, he said that would be particularly important to people interested in the level of exports to the Netherlands rather than the whole EU.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"

He said: ""Labour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone - not just its activists. ""Campaigns that deliberately turn their back on particular groups are doomed to fail. Just like in London, so-called natural Labour voters alone will never be enough to win a general election. ""We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security, as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.""BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Khan's comments would be seen as a message not just to Jeremy Corbyn but also to the Labour leader's critics.As he took office as London mayor in a ceremony in Southwark Cathedral, Mr Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants, promised to ""make our city better"" and be ""a mayor for all Londoners"".He also pledged to lead ""the most transparent, engaged and accessible administration London has ever seen"".The former Labour minister's victory in London ends eight years of Conservative control of City Hall.Mr Corbyn welcomed Mr Rees' victory, saying in a tweet: ""Another Labour mayor who will stand up for their city!""But the Labour leader was absent from Mr Khan's swearing-in ceremony earlier on Saturday, travelling instead to Bristol to congratulate that city's new mayor Marvin Rees. ""I am meeting Sadiq over the weekend, I have been in touch with him. We are getting on fine. I have sent him a message of congratulations,"" the Labour leader said.In other results from Thursday's election, Nicola Sturgeon's SNP party celebrated its third successive victory in the Holyrood election - though the result left the SNP two seats short of a majority in the parliament.In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionists remain the biggest party in the Assembly, with Arlene Foster continuing as first minister.In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs.Labour's vote share was down about 6% on average on 2012 - the last time the seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, and Plaid Cymru is up by two points. UKIP increased its vote by 12 points and saw seven candidates elected.The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. The Sadiq Khan story"

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.""Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions""."

Current UKIP rules allow different politicians to lead the assembly group and the party in Wales.A source close to Mr Gill said he was confident most UKIP AMs would back him.Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill were among seven new UKIP AMs elected on Thursday.Gareth Bennett, Mark Reckless, David Rowlands and Mr Gill took the oath of office at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay on Saturday.Mr Hamilton and another newly-elected AM - Caroline Jones - were present but were not sworn in.Party sources expect Mr Hamilton to make the leadership challenge on Tuesday to Mr Gill, who was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Mr Farage in 2014. Mr Hamilton and Ms Jones are expected to take the oath on Tuesday morning, after attending a meeting of UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday.At the meeting they will stand down from the NEC, which is required under UKIP's rules now that they have become elected politicians.A senior UKIP source suggested Mr Hamilton might use the meeting to attempt to change party rules stating that UKIP's national leader has the sole power to appoint the party's leader in Wales.Mr Hamilton has denied he has such a plan.Earlier on Saturday, Mr Hamilton told BBC Radio Wales that UKIP AMs would agree next week who should lead their group.He stressed that Mr Gill was not automatically in charge and said there were ""many people in UKIP"" with the right skills for the the job.  ""We're going to have a collective discussion when we all meet together and we'll come up with a decision as to which of us is likely to be the most effective leader in the assembly,"" he said.Asked if he would be the best candidate, Mr Hamilton added: ""I, of course, have a lot of parliamentary experience and so has [fellow UKIP AM and ex-Tory MP] Mark Reckless.""I've been around in politics for a very long time at quite a high level, and we have many people in UKIP who've got the kind of skills which will be advantageous to a leader.   ""But I'm not going to pre-empt the discussions that we will have, probably on Tuesday.""First Minister Carwyn Jones is spending the weekend preparing to form a new government, after Labour won 29 of the 60 seats, losing just one to Plaid.The new assembly is expected to hold its first meeting next week. Discussions are ongoing between the parties to decide who should be presiding officer and deputy presiding officer, and take charge of assembly proceedings.The Conservative assembly group will meet on Monday to discuss strategy, after a disappointing election under Welsh leader Andrew RT Davies.The party failed to win any target seats and lost three to fall into third place behind Plaid Cymru.Monmouth AM Nick Ramsay said the Conservatives' problems could not be ""brushed under the table"" and the leadership needed to be discussed.He called it a ""difficult"" campaign but backed Mr Davies.""The 11 of us that are now left need to look at where we go from here,"" he said.""[We need to] decide how we get there and then look at all issues, including the leadership, but other issues as well such as the strategy the group adopts.""A Welsh Conservative spokesman described the campaign as ""very positive"" and ""ambitious"" with ""great ideas"".""There's a fifth party in play now, which has affected everyone else,"" he said, referring to UKIP.""We've proven we can challenge in key seats next time around.""Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party would be ""constructive but playing the crucial role of a strong opposition"" to Labour. ""We will use that wisely to put forward a vision for the country which is as clear now as it was the day before the election,"" he said.Kirsty Williams, the only surviving Lib Dem AM, has resigned as leader of the party in Wales after it lost four of its five Senedd seats.Labour looks likely to form another minority Labour administration after an election in which only one constituency changed hands.And yet, the election has revealed a big change in Welsh politics - a change that has arrived in Cardiff Bay in the form of seven UKIP AMs who won seats on the regional lists.They say they want to shake the place up. But Nigel Farage also says they want to play a constructive role.I'm not sure how you achieve both.Either way, there's a question facing UKIP - who will lead them in Wales?Nathan Gill was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Nigel Farage in 2014 - a job he's compared to ""herding cats"".It sounds as though Neil Hamilton - the former Tory MP whose political career has been re-booted by this election - would be only too happy to relieve him of his duty.But his elevation is unlikely to heal rifts in the party. Even the suggestion that he could be a candidate in this election caused a row in UKIP's ranks."

The BMA agreed in principle to the idea of restarting talks and also to a possible deferral of any new threat of strikes for five days.BBC health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be ""clarity about the next steps by the end of the day"".  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday."" Mr Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continue discussions.Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.Last week, there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS."

""All of us need to learn lessons that Stormont is not delivering and people are not happy about that,"" he said.""We've had a rough couple of years, we've begun to change the face of the party and we're going to build from here.""BBC's Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler's view of the future assembly Alliance Party leader David Ford said his party had had a ""safe enough election compared to other parties"" and he was now concerned about shaping a programme for government that's ""inclusive and will promote the needs of all people in Northern Ireland"".Gerry Carroll won People Before Profit's first ever assembly seat in West Belfast at the expense of Sinn Féin.Anti-austerity party picks up seatsHe was followed by his colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann who took a seat from the SDLP in Foyle to secure his place at Stormont.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.The DUP's Frank McCoubrey came within 89 votes of winning a first unionist seat in West Belfast since the 2003 election, but he just lost out to Alex Attwood of the SDLP.Jim Allister retained his North Antrim seat for the Traditional Unionist Voice and Claire Bailey secured one for the Green Party in South Belfast.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt came out on top in the Strangford poll.But he said his pre-election prediction of the number of seats his party would win had been ""ambitious"".Naomi Long will return to Stormont for the Alliance Party, winning in East Belfast a year after she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP in the same constituency.Passing the 30 seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.But it lost a seat to Jenny Palmer, one of its former councillors who left the party last year after claiming she had been bullied. She was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.West Tyrone declared its first seat on Saturday - the SDLP's Daniel McCrossan - after the eighth count.Several MLAs from the previous assembly will not be returning to Stormont, with the independent John McCallister, the DUP's Ian McCrea and Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin among the most high-profile figures to lose their seats.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates stood in Thursday's election, with 108 seats in Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies up for grabs.In all, 703,744 people voted, and the turnout of 54.91% was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation, and about 2,000 count staff have been working at eight centres across Northern Ireland."
2016-05-08,Unions hail scrapping of academy plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36234989,"Teaching unions have welcomed the government's decision to ditch plans to force all state schools in England to become academies.  They said the move was recognition that ""one size"" did not fit all schools.Ministers said the government had listened to critics but the goal to turn schools into academies remained. Schools judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding will now not have to become academies, nor will small rural schools have to join a multi-academy trust.  The forced academisation proposals had been opposed by some Conservative MPs and councillors, as well as by unions and others. The government argues that academies drive up standards by giving more power to head teachers and allowing them to be more innovative. Critics have contended that academisation amounts to privatising the education system and say it is simplistic to say academies raise standards. Cabinet minister Michael Fallon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have now decided, having listened to parents and governors and our backbenchers that there is a better route to it, which is not forcing every school immediately to become an academy.""He said academisation would now focus only on schools that were ""clearly failing"".Asked whether ministers had tried to ""bury"" the announcement on a busy day for news, Mr Fallon said it would not have been ""legally"" possible to issue it in the preceding days because of the ""purdah"" restrictions on the activities of civil servants in election periods. Paul Luxmoore, executive head teacher of the Coastal Academies Trust in Kent, told Today he was ""dismayed"" at the policy reversal.""We've reached the tipping point, where local authorities - who have been delivering school improvements to schools until now - no longer have the capacity, or the money to do that effectively. Hence the government policy to make all schools academies over the next four years was entirely predictable and entirely sensible,"" he said.""I think they've lost their courage to go ahead with it because of all sorts of other political reasons [that have] very little to do with education.""Andy Miller, head teacher at St Nicholas Church of England Primary School in Blackpool, said the forced academisation plan had been a mistake. ""I would argue that head teachers, their governing bodies and their parent community actually know what's best for individual schools - rather than somebody in Westminster saying this is good for all of you,"" he said.National Association of Head Teachers president Kim Johnson said his organisation wanted ministers to understand ""that actually there isn't a case of one size fits all"" for schools. ""We're the intelligent practitioners and we want that opportunity, at the table with government, to further those discussions."" Tory backbencher Graham Brady, who welcomed the abandonment of the plans, said that ""the more that we can have these debates and discussions before legislation is brought forward, the better"".Alasdair Smith, from campaign group Anti Academies Alliance, said: ""We've known for more than 30 years exactly what improves schools, and it's not rocket science, it's high quality teaching and learning and good leadership. ""The government has not been pursuing that agenda, they've been pursuing structural change, and they've ignored high quality teaching, and high quality leadership, and that's why the policy is now in tatters.""Academies are independently run - but state-funded - schools, overseen by a not-for-profit business, known as an academy trust. They are often part of a chain.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said scrapping the plans was ""frankly a humiliating climbdown for David Cameron and his education secretary"".However, the government said it would push forward with compelling academy conversions in two areas:The government also announced measures to protect small rural schools including extra financial support and a requirement that any closure would have to be agreed by the local authority and the regional schools commissioner."
2016-05-08,SNP celebrate - as Labour 'hang on',https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36218450,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has downplayed talk of another independence referendum after winning the party's third election victory in a row.Confirming she would form a minority government at Holyrood, she said her aim was to ""persuade, not to divide"". Despite Labour coming third in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party had ""hung on"" and done better than expected in Wales and England.Sadiq Khan leads the London Mayoral election as counting continues.With all the results declared in Scotland, the SNP is the largest party with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24.Labour remains the dominant party in Wales, winning 29 out of 60 seats, but falling just short of a majority. Plaid Cymru pipped the Tories to be the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly while UKIP won seven seats on a good night for the party.Counting continues across English councils but the BBC is forecasting that, on the basis of the results so far, Labour would have got a 31% projected share of the national vote, with the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.Elections expert John Curtice said the result - calculated on the basis the UK electorate as a whole had behaved in the same way as voters did in the English local elections - was slightly better than Labour might have expected.In the London Mayoral race, a live update of the vote tally shows Labour candidate Sadiq Khan currently ahead of his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. In Northern Ireland, the first results for the assembly election are being declared with the final result due on Saturday. Tap here to search for election results in your area.Speaking in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said that despite falling two seats short of a majority, the SNP had secured an ""emphatic"" victory and had a ""clear and unequivocal"" mandate. She said the party would govern on its own rather than in alliance with other parties. On the issue of a future vote on independence, she said the SNP will make ""our case with passion, with patience but will always respect the opinion of the people"".But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said any prospect of the issue being reopened in the next five years had been ""utterly shredded"" by the SNP's failure to win a majority. Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.But nor is there much evidence of enthusiasm for the Conservative government in England. The Tories so far have picked up a handful of seats, traditionally an achievement for a party in power at these kinds of polls.But for success, and unexpected success, the Conservatives can look to Scotland where it appears they are set to take second place, - a fundamental change in Scotland. But there, voters again expressed their faith and belief in the Scottish National Party as their government.Read more from LauraIn the English council elections, BBC analysis suggests the Tory vote fell in southern England, which may have helped Labour to retain control of councils in areas such as Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where its vote was looking vulnerable.Labour's vote share is down about 6% on average on 2012  - the last time these seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But a BBC analysis suggests its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.Its share was more sharply down in Scotland. The party gained one seat from the SNP - Edinburgh Southern - but failed to take other targets and was beaten into third place by the Conservatives - a result that would have been unthinkable in the past.Labour also lost its Rhondda Welsh Assembly seat, in its south Wales heartlands, to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In other developments:Brighter news for Labour came with it holding the seat of Sheffield Brightside in a Westminster by-election, with UKIP coming second. The party also held Ogmore in another Parliamentary by-election, in South Wales, with UKIP again in second place. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Corbyn said it had ""grown support"" in parts of England but he acknowledged the scale of the defeat in Scotland, saying there was a ""lot of building"" to do. Amid speculation about Mr Corbyn's future, his deputy Tom Watson said he needed ""more time"" to show he could revive Labour fortunes.But MP Michael Dugher said Labour was ""not on a trajectory"" to victory in 2020 while shadow scottish secretary Ian Murray suggested the public did not see Labour ""at the moment as being a credible party of future government"". For the Conservatives, the highlights of the evening were in Scotland, winning the Holyrood seat of Eastwood from Labour and Ruth Davidson's winning Edinburgh Central from the SNP.David Cameron said the party's second place in Scotland and its showing in England, where it took control of Peterborough Council and won council seats in key Westminster marginals such as Dudley and Nuneaton, represented a good result for a party in government for six years.""Local election day for sitting prime ministers is supposed to be a day of dread, waiting for the knock on the door like a condemned man waiting for a hangman,"" he said. ""But that's wasn't what it was like last night.""In a surprise result in Wales, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood unseated Labour's Leighton Andrews in the Rhondda - described by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain as ""a terrible shock for us in Welsh Labour"".Ms Wood said: ""A new dawn has already broken over the Valleys, people have voted for change.""In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, while Plaid Cymru is up by two points.The big story of the night in Wales was the performance of UKIP, which saw its vote increase by 12 points. The party's leader Nigel Farage hailed it as a significant breakthrough. In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs. The majority of the seats were last contested in 2012.Thursday's polls were the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020, with 43 million people entitled to take part.What's still to come (all timings are estimates)Friday 6 May11:30 onwards: Forty four councils in England declaring on Friday15:00: First results of London Assembly elections17:00: First preference vote share information for elections to Northern Ireland Assembly1800: Result of first preference votes for Mayor of London (final result expected early evening)Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England and Salford mayoral contest are also expected on Friday.Saturday 7 May14:00 Results from five remaining councils in England16:00 Result of Bristol Mayoral contestResult of elections to Northern Ireland Assembly expectedSunday 8 May16:00 Result of elections to Bristol Council (final council in England to declare)Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in Wales"
2016-05-08,DUP past 30 seats in NI Assembly election,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-northern-ireland-36212550,"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has passed the 30-seats mark after the first day of counting in the Northern Ireland Assembly election.Three-quarters of the 108 seats have been filled, with the DUP on 33.Eleven constituencies have been fully declared, and counting has ended for the night in seven areas.So far, Sinn Féin has 19 seats, Ulster Unionists have 10, the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) has nine and the Alliance Party has six.Passing the 30-seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.Gerry Carroll won a first ever assembly seat for the People Before Profit Alliance, topping the poll in West Belfast for the left-wing party to take one of the five seats Sinn Féin had held in the constituency.The SDLP's Alex Attwood retained his West Belfast seat by a narrow margin, overcoming DUP challenger Frank McCoubrey by just 89 votes.Mr Carroll said his success was evidence that voters had become ""fed-up with the status quo"" and were ""looking for a political alternative"".He was joined by his party colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann, who was elected in Foyle, taking a seat from the SDLP.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in his home constituency of Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat when he was eliminated after the first count, but he said his his nine years as an MLA had been a ""privilege"".He was twice elected as an Ulster Unionist but left the party in 2013 to form the ill-fated NI21, which imploded just over a year later.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said he was ""stunned"" to top the Strangford poll, but acknowledged that he had been ""ambitious"" with his prediction of the number of seats his party would win.Alliance Party leader David Ford crossed the line in South Antrim and Jim Allister, who leads the Traditional Unionist Voice, was re-elected in North Antrim.Former MP Naomi Long will return to frontline politics after her election for the Alliance Party in East Belfast, where she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP last year.The DUP's Joanne Bunting has taken the East Belfast seat vacated by former first minister Peter Robinson, who retired earlier this year.In South Belfast, the city's former lord mayor Máirtín Ó Muilleoir was elected after topping the poll and Claire Bailey gained a seat in the constituency for the Green Party, saying she wanted to ""change the conversation at Stormont"".The DUP also made a gain in the constituency, with councillor Christopher Stalford taking the seat that had been held by the UUP.Jenny Palmer, a councillor who left the DUP last year after claiming she had been bullied, took a seat off her former party when she was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.Former agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew, who left the assembly to serve as an MP, will return to Stormont after her election for Sinn Féin in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.William Irwin of the DUP came top of the poll Newry and Armagh, while former Armagh gaelic footballer Justin McNulty will be another new face in the assembly for the SDLP after securing his party's single seat in the constituency.Three Sinn Féin candidates came through in Mid Ulster, but the DUP's McCrea dynasty came to an end when Ian, the son of former MP and MLA William, lost his seat to party colleague Keith Buchanan.Former health minister Jim Wells, who has endured a series of controversies in the past two years, was re-elected in South Down.He made a formal complaint to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland after his wife and the husband of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) candidate Sinéad Bradley were denied entry to the count.The leaders of the two largest parties in Northern Ireland will be delighted by the results so far.The DUP is on course to hold the seats it took in 2011 and Sinn Féin are hopeful they will better their 2011 election when they won 29 seats.In contrast, it has been a disappointing day for the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates have been competing across Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies.In all, 703,744 people voted in the election, representing a turnout of 54.91%, which was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.In general terms, turnout in eastern constituencies has increased compared to 2011, but dropped in western constituencies.More than 2,000 staff are involved in counting the votes in eight centres across Northern Ireland.In Northern Ireland, MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation.Seven counts will resume on Saturday morning, with the final seats not due to be declared later in the day."
2016-05-08,Police probe Tory election expenses,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36231138,"Eight police forces are investigating whether Conservative MPs filed election expenses illegally after the 2015 General Election, the BBC understands.The allegations centre around failing to register the accommodation costs of party activists who were involved in the ""battle bus"" operation. The party has blamed an ""administrative error"".A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.The activists on the party's battle bus targeted marginal seats. The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.Failing to file correct expenses is a criminal offence.The eight forces actively investigating are West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, Greater Manchester Police, Devon and Cornwall Police, Gloucestershire Police, Northamptonshire Police, Staffordshire Police, and Cheshire Police.A further four forces are waiting for further information, the BBC understands.Police can investigate such claims up to a year after the election expenses were filed, and West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, and Greater Manchester Police have started the process of getting extensions to the time limit.A Conservative spokesperson said: ""As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus. ""However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return.  ""The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. ""Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning.""The Electoral Commission - which is an independent body that sets standards for running elections - is also investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act during the general election.The Commission has powers in relation to national campaign spending, although its sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance at the Electoral Commission, said: ""The police and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. ""We have requested that they consider doing this."" "

We didn't.""We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places.""He congratulated the ""hard work"" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: ""There is a lot of building to do in Scotland. ""We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again.""They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a ""weak leader"" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as ""shocking"". The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.""We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats,"" Tim Roache, its general secretary said. ""Let's give it a go. Let's give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen? Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day. Who knows.""But Mr McDonnell told critics to ""get behind the leader of the Labour Party that was democratically elected"".He added: ""I think most Labour Party members are saying 'look, you're damaging our campaign by the continuous carping'.""I've never been in a situation where, two days before a poll, a group of them are talking to the media about a leadership coup - and yet we still do well.""Former Labour minister Lord Falconer urged the party to focus ""outwards"" following a row over anti-Semitism involving the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.""There's real issues that need to be dealt with, but this idea of a divided party makes the Labour party despair and the public despair,"" he added."

2016-05-08,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-08,The Sadiq Khan story,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36140479,"Labour's Sadiq Khan has been elected as London's new mayor - but who is the man who will be in charge of the UK's capital city for the next four years?Sadiq Khan's life to date has been characterised by beating the odds - which is what he has just done to become mayor of London.When Labour politicians put themselves forward to run for mayor last year, Mr Khan was far from being the favourite. The bookies' money was on Baroness Jowell, a veteran of the Tony Blair years who had helped bring the Olympics to London. But if there is a pattern in Mr Khan's career, it's one of coming from behind. The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. Age: 45Marital status: Married with two daughtersPolitical party: LabourTime as MP: Has represented Tooting in south London since 2005Previous jobs: Human rights solicitor, chair of Liberty""Son of a bus driver"" became one of the most hackneyed phrases in Mr Khan's time on the stump - so overused in his leaflets and speeches that he was eventually forced to make fun of his own campaign, joking he had given the Daily Mirror an ""exclusive"" on his background. But his parents' story holds real significance for him. Amanullah and Sehrun Khan emigrated from Pakistan to London shortly before Sadiq was born, in 1970. He was the fifth of their eight children - seven sons and a daughter. He has often said that his early impressions of the world of work shaped his belief in the trade union movement. His father, a bus driver for 25 years, ""was in a union and got decent pay and conditions"" whereas his mum, a stay-at-home seamstress, ""wasn't, and didn't"".He lived with his parents and siblings in a cramped three-bedroomed house on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield, south-west London, sharing a bunkbed with one of his brothers until he left home in his 20s. He attended the local comprehensive, Ernest Bevin College, which he describes as ""a tough school - it wasn't always a bed of roses"". The nickname ""Bevin boys"" was at that time in that part of south London a byword for bad behaviour.It was at school that he first began to gravitate towards politics, joining the Labour Party aged 15. He credits the school's head, Naz Bokhari, who happened to be the first Muslim headteacher at a UK secondary school, with making him realise ""skin colour or background wasn't a barrier to making something with your life"".Mr Khan was raised a Muslim and has never shied away from acknowledging the importance of his faith. In his maiden speech as an MP he spoke about his father teaching him Mohammed's sayings, or hadiths - in particular the principle that ""if one sees something wrong, one has the duty to try to change it"".He was an able student who loved football, boxing and cricket - he even had a trial for Surrey County Cricket Club as a teenager. He has since spoken about the racist abuse he and his brothers faced at Wimbledon and Chelsea football matches, saying he felt ""safer"" watching at home and became a Liverpool fan simply ""because they were playing such great football at the time"".He studied maths and science at A-level with the idea of becoming a dentist. He was switched on to law by a teacher who told him ""you're always arguing"" - and by the TV programme LA Law, starring Jimmy Smits as Victor Sifuentes, a charismatic partner in a California law firm.""LA law was about lawyers in LA who do great cases, act for the underdog, drove nice cars, look great and I wanted to be Sifuentes,"" Mr Khan told Business Insider recently.He studied law at the University of North London and put his degree to good use straight away, becoming a trainee solicitor in 1994 at Christian Fisher under the human rights lawyer Louise Christian. The same year he met and married his wife Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor and coincidentally the daughter of a bus driver - with whom he went on to have two daughters, Anisah and Ammarah. He also began his 12-year stint as a councillor for Tooting, encouraged by Guyanan-born local activist Bert Luthers.Just three years later, aged 27, he was made an equity partner and the firm was renamed Christian Khan.During this time he worked on a number of high-profile cases: he won compensation for Kenneth Hsu, a hairdresser wrongly arrested and assaulted by the police; teachers and lawyers who had experienced racial discrimination; Leroy Logan, a senior black police officer accused of fraud; corrupt former Met Police commander Ali Dizaei; and helped overturn an exclusion order (later upheld on appeal) on US political activist Louis Farrakhan.The irony of a man who represented people in cases against the Met going on to become the force's chief scrutineer has not been lost on his opponents. Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith, speaking at an event alongside Home Secretary Theresa May, recently characterised Mr Khan's legal career as ""coaching people in suing our police"".He left his law firm somewhat abruptly in 2004, afterwards telling the Law Gazette: ""If you're in government, you're a legislator and you have the opportunity to make laws that can improve things for millions of people.""In 2005, Mr Khan fought and retained the marginal seat of Tooting for Labour, one of five new ethnic minority MPs elected that year.Contemporaries on either side of the political divide remember being impressed by a ""fiercely bright"" and ""persuasive"" individual who was ""impossible not to listen to"". He combines that sharpness with what is often called his ""cheeky chappy"" demeanour. He is fond of calling people ""mate"" and has even done so on the floor of the Commons.Two months after he entered the Commons, he was thrust into the limelight by the 7 July bombings. When Parliament met to discuss the attacks, he told MPs: ""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted on Thursday; proud of the way ordinary courageous Londoners carried on with their business and stopped the criminals disrupting our life.""In a 2010 Guardian interview, he recalled thinking: ""I couldn't hide - and I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but there were so few articulate voices of reason from the British Muslim community. ""There were angry men with beards, but nobody saying, 'Actually, I'm very comfortable being a Brit, being a Muslim, being a Londoner'."" The intervention marked him out as one to watch, but his path to promotion was not altogether smooth. Mr Khan wore his civil liberties credentials on his sleeve, challenging the government over ID cards and joining 48 other Labour rebels to vote against prime minister Tony Blair's plan to allow the detention of terror suspects without charge for up to 90 days. He later claimed party chiefs had penalised him by preventing him from visiting Pakistan in the wake of an earthquake there and did not want to give him an office with a sofa.But the rebellion was not altogether to his disadvantage. Tony Blair was on his way out, and Mr Khan was able to position himself on the ascendant ""soft left"" of the Labour party alongside Ed Balls and Gordon Brown. ""It was a tough school; it wasn't always a bed of roses. But you become street wise, you become savvy and you learn social skills - you learn about how to deal with people."" - on his schooldays""The way allegations of misconduct against police officers are investigated is flawed and inadequate."" - as a human rights solicitor""Although I'd won cases at the European Court of Human Rights, and I'd won cases in the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal, I still couldn't escape the fact that if you're part of the legislature and the executive, you can make legislation that improves the quality of life for literally millions of people."" - on leaving law to become an MP""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted."" - on the 7/7 attacks""Most people feel nagged by their parents from time to time, but very rarely is it about the future of bus regulation."" - on his father ""I sleep in my own bed. When I get home I put the rubbish out and get my girls up to go to school."" - on staying grounded""For the last eight years you've seen a red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hand. I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners."" - on launching his mayoral bidWhen Gordon Brown took over at Number 10, Mr Khan was given his first job in government as a whip and then as communities minister, a move that created disquiet among some other MPs in the capital who had been around for longer.A post at the Department for Transport followed in 2009 and he became the first Muslim in the Cabinet. This was at a time when there were only four Muslim MPs and he was often confused for international development minister Shahid Malik.He would go on to claim during the mayoral campaign that as transport minister he had ""pushed"" Crossrail through Parliament, but the Mayorwatch website has shown Mr Khan only took on responsibility for the project after the relevant bill had become law. At the 2010 election, Mr Khan's own majority was squeezed to an uncomfortably small margin of just 2,524 votes and Labour was out of government for the first time in 13 years.In the chaotic months of Labour soul-searching that followed, he again showed a canny ability to ally himself with what was seemingly a lost cause and turn it into success.True to his Brownite colours, he was chosen as Ed Miliband's campaign manager and helped steer the less-favoured Miliband brother towards an unexpected leadership election victory.He told the New Statesman afterwards that the night before the result, he told Miliband to ""prepare for defeat"". ""I learned this from (television series) Rumpole of the Bailey,"" he said. ""Always tell your client he's going to lose because, if he loses, he's expecting it; if he wins, you're the fantastic lawyer who got the victory."" However, he added: ""I had a feeling we'd done it.""In that contest, as in the Labour mayoral nomination, Mr Khan's support for the trade union movement helped his campaign secure crucial votes.He was rewarded with the post of shadow justice secretary - a role in which he did not get off to an auspicious start. His first major speech was badly received when he chose to highlight Labour's failings in government, and in then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke he faced an adversary with whom he admitted he struggled to find things to disagree about.His other brief as shadow political reform minister did not provide much of a chance to shine either, as the coalition needed little help killing off its own proposals for Lords reform and his personal support for changes to the voting system was tempered by his view that the referendum on this - which saw the British public reject change - came at the wrong time.When Mr Clarke was sacked and replaced with Chris Grayling, however, Mr Khan was able to take the fight to the despatch box more convincingly as a vocal opponent of reforms to legal aid and restrictions on books in prisons.When the Conservatives later reversed several of Mr Grayling's flagship policies he described it as a ""huge climbdown"" that showed Labour had been right to resist them.Labour's disastrous showing in the 2015 election and the swift resignation of Ed Miliband - the man he had helped to the leadership - could have thrown Mr Khan off-course, but he found a new focus for his campaigning energy.Just a week after the election he announced he would seek the Labour nomination for mayor. He had already been tipped as a possible contender at least a year but, with typical shrewdness, he had steadfastly refused to be drawn on the subject in public while sounding out MPs and councillors in private to see if he had enough support.Once he had confirmed his mayoral ambitions, his quest for the nomination - let alone an election win - still seemed like a long shot. Baroness Jowell, who had been MP for Dulwich and West Norwood for 23 years and held a number of senior ministerial positions under Labour, was widely seen as the natural choice.That received wisdom was upended during the Labour leadership contest, when commentators predicted the influx of new members into the party over the summer of ""Corbynmania"" could play into Mr Khan's hands. He would take some flak over his role in Jeremy Corbyn's election as party leader, as he nominated him but later voted for Andy Burnham. In the event, however, Mr Khan came out top as Labour choice of candidate not just with new members but in all three groups who could vote. It was a remarkable victory which, as the BBC's Norman Smith observed on the day, surprised him as much as it did his rivals.The campaign that ensued was bloody. A former aide to long-time Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, Ayesha Hazarika, reflected that when Zac Goldsmith - who had a reputation for being decent, attractive and independent-minded - was first picked as the Conservative candidate there was despondency in Labour ranks.Mr Khan said himself at one hustings that he thought his opponent had been a ""nice guy until [Conservative strategist] Sir Lynton Crosby got his hands on him"". Whoever came up with the approach, Mr Goldsmith's campaign focused heavily on portraying Mr Khan as an associate of ""extremists"" - which in turn allowed Labour to attack the Conservatives for pursuing ""divisive, dog-whistle"" tactics. Mr Khan took this to be an attempt to smear him by association because of his religion. The Conservatives insisted they were talking about his brand of left-wing politics - but Mr Goldsmith repeatedly said the Labour candidate had ""given platform, oxygen and cover to extremists"".It became a source of such bitter tension between the two camps that when David Cameron stuck up for Mr Goldsmith's campaign at prime minister's questions he found the word ""racist"" flung back at him from the Labour benches.While polls consistently suggested Mr Khan was ahead, Labour pessimists and Conservative optimists would remind themselves that Mr Goldsmith was likely to benefit from a Tory incumbency, from lower turnout among groups that tended to vote Labour, and from the under-reporting of Conservative support seen at the 2015 general election.But those things were not enough - or proved not to be the case at all. Voter turnout was 45%, an increase of 7% on 2012, and it was clear quite early on in the day that Mr Khan had a healthy lead over his Conservative rival.Another London Labour MP born to immigrant parents, David Lammy, told the BBC Mr Khan's election was a ""huge moment"" and predicted: ""If we ever see a black or Asian prime minister in this country I have no doubt they will owe an enormous debt to Sadiq Khan.""Now, the boy from Tooting will have to prove himself all over again. Love them or loathe them, the mayor's predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone - the only other men to have done the job - are political heavyweights. Even within his own party, Mr Khan has been accused of lacking vision. The perception of him as inexperienced also lingers on.One close Labour ally pointed out that ""unlike Ken, he has held ministerial office - but more than that, he represents the future. Unlike Boris he'll be wholly focused on getting results for London - this isn't just a stepping stone for his career"".She predicted he would be anxious to make good on the ambitious promises he made during the campaign, particularly on addressing London's housing problems.If that were not enough to be getting on with, he faces a dilemma over how to navigate between co-operating with the Conservative government and teaming up with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in condemnation of the Tories.In this respect he may hope to repeat the tactics of Boris Johnson, who managed to pull off alternately angering and assisting the government. If he is to succeed he will need to display the same knack for steering his own course as he has shown as a schoolboy, a campaigning lawyer, a backbench MP and a shadow minister.But those who voted for him will not forget his emphasis on his own disadvantaged background, his speeches about social justice and his promise to be a ""mayor for all Londoners""."
2016-05-08,Independence loss,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36227731,"It never feels good for any politician to wake up the morning after an election defeat. Today it's hard to imagine many senior Labour figures got much sleep at all last night. No doubt lying awake contemplating their humiliating defeat by the Tories who knocked them decisively into third place. But also having to ask deeper existential questions about whether there is still a place for the Labour party in the Scottish political landscape.Labour can spend the next few days and weeks asking if it was their polices that voters didn't like. Was it a mistake to offer to raise income tax for almost every taxpayer in Scotland? Was it their young and inexperienced leader who has only been in the job nine short months? Was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership a factor?But arguments over their manifesto or personalities are to miss the point. This election was clearly about the constitution. Scottish politics are still totally dominated by the independence question which was certainly not settled on 18 September 2014 and still seems to take precedence in voters' minds over any other issue. And it's an issue on which Labour cannot win.""We have to get our story straight on where we stand on independence"", is what very depressed Labour figures were telling me on Thursday night. But they had different ideas about what that story should be.Labour can never form another government in Holyrood or win back many of their Westminster seats unless they appeal to former Labour voters who have now decided they favour an independent Scotland and are currently voting SNP. But what we learned last night was that if Labour don't take a hard line on their support for the union they haemorrhage votes to the Tories. Labour tried to reach out to Yes voters by saying that if there was another referendum Labour politicians would be free to campaign on either side. Kezia Dugdale even suggested in one interview that she might consider voting for independence in the event of a Brexit but then tried to row back from that - whilst also saying that she resolutely opposed the idea of having another referendum and would vigorously campaign for a no vote if there was to be another indyref.That left space for the Tories to proclaim themselves the only true party of the Union. They accused Labour of being soft on independence and it seems to have worked. The roughly 10% of voters the Tories seem to have grabbed from Labour are largely unionists who wanted to express their opposition to independence at the ballot box once more. So where does that leave Labour? If the SNP are the party of independence and the Tories the party of the union, what is the point of the Labour Party? They will continue to argue that they care most about social justice and poverty. But as long as voters remain split over the constitution that may not win back many voters.   One small consolation for Scottish labour leader Kezia Dugdale - it seems unlikely she will face a leadership challenge even despite this terrible result. Why? Partly because Labour have finally realised changing leaders every time they lose an election hasn't helped. But mostly because no-one wants the job of Scottish labour leader right now. And who can blame them?"
2016-05-08,Political maps,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36215186,"What impact have the elections had on the political maps of London, Scotland, Wales and England?In London, Labour's Sadiq Khan defeated Conservative Zac Goldsmith to become mayor. Khan came out on top in three constituencies that had voted for former mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012. After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%.The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.Of the 14 London Assembly seats, Labour won nine, taking Merton and Wandsworth from the Conservatives, who held five boroughs.The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six, and the Lib Dems five.  Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour. But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP. The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies. The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament. That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.  Labour is likely to hang on to power in Wales, with just one constituency changing hands, as Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party. The biggest shift in Welsh politics overnight is the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	Although UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third. In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent. Voters in some parts in England have also been choosing their local councillors. A total of 124 councils are up for re-election, in part or in whole. After 115 results had been announced, Labour had lost 24 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, which is now under no overall control. The Conservatives had lost a total of 33 council seats, having been up on their previous total earlier, but have not lost control of any of the 28 councils up for re-election. The Lib Dems had gained 35 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control. UKIP had 26 more council seats - but had not been able to convert these gains into control of any council. At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	In general, turnout was significantly lower in Wales, but it was highest at 56.8% in Cardiff North where Labour won with about 45% of the vote and Brecon and Radnorshire where the Lib Dems took more than half of the vote. The biggest increase in turnout in Wales was in the Rhondda, the only constituency seat that changed hands.

2016-05-08,Corbyn's future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36223968,"They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable.But the results were messier than they predicted.So when Jo Cox - the Batley MP who nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership to broaden the party's debate - says that Labour should have performed better at these elections, she has logic and precedence on her side. The party fared less well than the last time many of these seats were contested, in 2012, and Labour still went on to lose the subsequent general election.But it's not clear that the results provide enough ammunition for those who want to take aim at the leadership. Mr Corbyn's supporters will point out the party didn't hold on just in its northern heartlands, but in areas where it expected to lose - right down on the south coast, in Southampton and Hastings.His internal critics have been pointing out privately all night that beneath the surface, some of the results aren't anything to write home about. Labour retained overall control in Nuneaton for example, but lost ground to the Conservatives.  Crucially, though, the party's deputy leader Tom Watson made it clear he wasn't sanctioning any coup attempt with Mr Corbyn, who has been in the job for only eight months. He didn't think either winning - or losing - 100 seats should prove decisive, and he will have in mind that members and supporters who elected the Labour leader last September are unlikely to have been appalled at results which saw Labour retain control of Crawley. Since the 2014 referendum, Scotland tends to be viewed through a different prism. Unlike in England, Labour has to compete against another party describing itself as social-democratic: the SNP.But elsewhere in the UK, some Labour MPs, if not the new supporters of the party, will ask if there are lessons to be learnt from campaigning unsuccessfully on a platform of higher taxes for better public services.But a better guide to Labour's current weakness might be the Conservatives' strength.A governing party tearing itself apart from the grassroots to the cabinet table over Britain's relationship with the EU certainly looks like it will suffer some setbacks, notably in London.But it is on course for ending up with an increased tally of councillors - and very possibly becoming the official opposition in Scotland after years in the political wilderness.

Heavily involved in delivery the Olympics and its legacy, he briefly worked as head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn.Seen as capable and pragmatic, he's likely to have a role in settling Team Khan into the eight-floor offices. Another name being touted is that of Andrew Adonis - a former cabinet minister and currently the head of the National Infrastructure Commission.With big projects like Crossrail 2 and HS2 coming down the track, his expertise could prove key, but it may require him to walk away from the national job.If he's looking for a deputy mayor for policing, the smart money seems to be on current Assembly member Joanne McCartney, a trained barrister and Labour member for Enfield and Haringey, who has chaired the assembly's Police and Crime Committee.Fiona Twycross, who has worked on the Fire Authority, may also be rewarded.Former Bethnal Green MP Oona King, who backed Mr Khan when he first announced he was running, may enter City Hall in a communities role.Expect roles too for policy director Nick Bowes - widely seen as the ideas person behind the new mayor's campaign - and Leah Kreitzman and Jack Stenner, who have been key members of team Khan since he became Labour's candidate.Ex-journalist Patrick Hennessy, who ran communications for Mr Khan during the election campaign, is likely to continue selling the message."

That ""suggests that the statement in the government leaflet is not significantly affected by it"".It may seem odd that the impact is so small, given that the Netherlands is the third biggest customer for UK exports, behind the USA and Germany. But remember that the Rotterdam Effect only affects exports of goods, while the 44% figure is for both goods and services.Sir Andrew did suggest that a more prominent note in the statistics about the Rotterdam Effect would be helpful. In evidence to the parliamentary committee chaired by  Bernard Jenkin, he said that would be particularly important to people interested in the level of exports to the Netherlands rather than the whole EU.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"

But its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, and Plaid Cymru is up by two points. UKIP increased its vote by 12 points and saw seven candidates elected.The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him.

Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions""."
2016-05-09,Hamilton bid to lead UKIP in assembly,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-wales-36233182,"Neil Hamilton is expected to challenge Nathan Gill to lead UKIP's new assembly group, sources have told BBC Wales.The former Tory MP has denied a suggestion by a senior UKIP source that he will try to change party rules giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage sole power to appoint the leader in Wales. Current UKIP rules allow different politicians to lead the assembly group and the party in Wales.A source close to Mr Gill said he was confident most UKIP AMs would back him.Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill were among seven new UKIP AMs elected on Thursday.Gareth Bennett, Mark Reckless, David Rowlands and Mr Gill took the oath of office at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay on Saturday.Mr Hamilton and another newly-elected AM - Caroline Jones - were present but were not sworn in.Party sources expect Mr Hamilton to make the leadership challenge on Tuesday to Mr Gill, who was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Mr Farage in 2014. Mr Hamilton and Ms Jones are expected to take the oath on Tuesday morning, after attending a meeting of UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday.At the meeting they will stand down from the NEC, which is required under UKIP's rules now that they have become elected politicians.A senior UKIP source suggested Mr Hamilton might use the meeting to attempt to change party rules stating that UKIP's national leader has the sole power to appoint the party's leader in Wales.Mr Hamilton has denied he has such a plan.Earlier on Saturday, Mr Hamilton told BBC Radio Wales that UKIP AMs would agree next week who should lead their group.He stressed that Mr Gill was not automatically in charge and said there were ""many people in UKIP"" with the right skills for the the job.  ""We're going to have a collective discussion when we all meet together and we'll come up with a decision as to which of us is likely to be the most effective leader in the assembly,"" he said.Asked if he would be the best candidate, Mr Hamilton added: ""I, of course, have a lot of parliamentary experience and so has [fellow UKIP AM and ex-Tory MP] Mark Reckless.""I've been around in politics for a very long time at quite a high level, and we have many people in UKIP who've got the kind of skills which will be advantageous to a leader.   ""But I'm not going to pre-empt the discussions that we will have, probably on Tuesday.""First Minister Carwyn Jones is spending the weekend preparing to form a new government, after Labour won 29 of the 60 seats, losing just one to Plaid.The new assembly is expected to hold its first meeting next week. Discussions are ongoing between the parties to decide who should be presiding officer and deputy presiding officer, and take charge of assembly proceedings.The Conservative assembly group will meet on Monday to discuss strategy, after a disappointing election under Welsh leader Andrew RT Davies.The party failed to win any target seats and lost three to fall into third place behind Plaid Cymru.Monmouth AM Nick Ramsay said the Conservatives' problems could not be ""brushed under the table"" and the leadership needed to be discussed.He called it a ""difficult"" campaign but backed Mr Davies.""The 11 of us that are now left need to look at where we go from here,"" he said.""[We need to] decide how we get there and then look at all issues, including the leadership, but other issues as well such as the strategy the group adopts.""A Welsh Conservative spokesman described the campaign as ""very positive"" and ""ambitious"" with ""great ideas"".""There's a fifth party in play now, which has affected everyone else,"" he said, referring to UKIP.""We've proven we can challenge in key seats next time around.""Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party would be ""constructive but playing the crucial role of a strong opposition"" to Labour. ""We will use that wisely to put forward a vision for the country which is as clear now as it was the day before the election,"" he said.Kirsty Williams, the only surviving Lib Dem AM, has resigned as leader of the party in Wales after it lost four of its five Senedd seats.Labour looks likely to form another minority Labour administration after an election in which only one constituency changed hands.And yet, the election has revealed a big change in Welsh politics - a change that has arrived in Cardiff Bay in the form of seven UKIP AMs who won seats on the regional lists.They say they want to shake the place up. But Nigel Farage also says they want to play a constructive role.I'm not sure how you achieve both.Either way, there's a question facing UKIP - who will lead them in Wales?Nathan Gill was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Nigel Farage in 2014 - a job he's compared to ""herding cats"".It sounds as though Neil Hamilton - the former Tory MP whose political career has been re-booted by this election - would be only too happy to relieve him of his duty.But his elevation is unlikely to heal rifts in the party. Even the suggestion that he could be a candidate in this election caused a row in UKIP's ranks."
2016-05-09,Doctors to decide on NHS contract talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36234731,"Junior doctor representatives at the British Medical Association (BMA) will meet later to decide whether to hold talks with the government over a disputed new NHS employment contract.Negotiations over the contract broke down in February and junior doctors have staged several strikes since then.Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they could focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours.The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says there should be no preconditions.The government says it is willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA agreed in principle to the idea of restarting talks and also to a possible deferral of any new threat of strikes for five days.BBC health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be ""clarity about the next steps by the end of the day"".  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday."" Mr Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continue discussions.Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.Last week, there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS."

The final count in Upper Bann ended on Saturday afternoon.Northern Ireland Assembly election resultsThe DUP has 38 seats, while Sinn Féin has 28, the Ulster Unionists 16, SDLP 12 and the Alliance Party eight.The Greens and People Before Profit Alliance have two seats each. The TUV leader Jim Allister remains its sole representative.In terms of the last assembly, the DUP holds the same number of seats and Sinn Féin has dropped one seat.It has been a difficult election for both the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.In the end, the Ulster Unionists ended up with the same number of seats as before, but the SDLP lost two seats, one in Foyle and the other, after a marathon counting session, was Dolores Kelly's seat in Upper Bann.DUP leader Mrs Foster said: ""I'm absolutely delighted with the mandate that my party has been given to drive forward Northern Ireland into the future."" ""Of course, people have spoken and they have spoken very clearly.""Looking at the Sinn Féin strategy in this election, Gerry Kelly said: ""I think what we will do is take it constituency by constituency and look at vote management and all of the rest of it. I think, to a great extent, that the vote management wasn't that bad.""Moments from count centres across Northern IrelandHe said his part knew that Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit would take the seat in West Belfast.""We agree with what a lot of what People Before Profit say. There are some things we disagree with. We said we would work with them in the south and we will certainly work with them in the north."" UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said his party's campaign had been neither a success, nor a failure. He said the party would return 16 seats, the same as in 2011, but signalled a ""change of personnel"".SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had been left with ""a lot of work to do"".  ""All of us need to learn lessons that Stormont is not delivering and people are not happy about that,"" he said.""We've had a rough couple of years, we've begun to change the face of the party and we're going to build from here.""BBC's Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler's view of the future assembly Alliance Party leader David Ford said his party had had a ""safe enough election compared to other parties"" and he was now concerned about shaping a programme for government that's ""inclusive and will promote the needs of all people in Northern Ireland"".Gerry Carroll won People Before Profit's first ever assembly seat in West Belfast at the expense of Sinn Féin.Anti-austerity party picks up seatsHe was followed by his colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann who took a seat from the SDLP in Foyle to secure his place at Stormont.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.The DUP's Frank McCoubrey came within 89 votes of winning a first unionist seat in West Belfast since the 2003 election, but he just lost out to Alex Attwood of the SDLP.Jim Allister retained his North Antrim seat for the Traditional Unionist Voice and Claire Bailey secured one for the Green Party in South Belfast.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt came out on top in the Strangford poll.But he said his pre-election prediction of the number of seats his party would win had been ""ambitious"".Naomi Long will return to Stormont for the Alliance Party, winning in East Belfast a year after she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP in the same constituency.Passing the 30 seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.But it lost a seat to Jenny Palmer, one of its former councillors who left the party last year after claiming she had been bullied. She was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.West Tyrone declared its first seat on Saturday - the SDLP's Daniel McCrossan - after the eighth count.Several MLAs from the previous assembly will not be returning to Stormont, with the independent John McCallister, the DUP's Ian McCrea and Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin among the most high-profile figures to lose their seats.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates stood in Thursday's election, with 108 seats in Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies up for grabs.In all, 703,744 people voted, and the turnout of 54.91% was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation, and about 2,000 count staff have been working at eight centres across Northern Ireland."
2016-05-09,Unions hail scrapping of academy plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36234989,"Teaching unions have welcomed the government's decision to ditch plans to force all state schools in England to become academies.  They said the move was recognition that ""one size"" did not fit all schools.Ministers said the government had listened to critics but the goal to turn schools into academies remained. Schools judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding will now not have to become academies, nor will small rural schools have to join a multi-academy trust.  The forced academisation proposals had been opposed by some Conservative MPs and councillors, as well as by unions and others. The government argues that academies drive up standards by giving more power to head teachers and allowing them to be more innovative. Critics have contended that academisation amounts to privatising the education system and say it is simplistic to say academies raise standards. Cabinet minister Michael Fallon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have now decided, having listened to parents and governors and our backbenchers that there is a better route to it, which is not forcing every school immediately to become an academy.""He said academisation would now focus only on schools that were ""clearly failing"".Asked whether ministers had tried to ""bury"" the announcement on a busy day for news, Mr Fallon said it would not have been ""legally"" possible to issue it in the preceding days because of the ""purdah"" restrictions on the activities of civil servants in election periods. Paul Luxmoore, executive head teacher of the Coastal Academies Trust in Kent, told Today he was ""dismayed"" at the policy reversal.""We've reached the tipping point, where local authorities - who have been delivering school improvements to schools until now - no longer have the capacity, or the money to do that effectively. Hence the government policy to make all schools academies over the next four years was entirely predictable and entirely sensible,"" he said.""I think they've lost their courage to go ahead with it because of all sorts of other political reasons [that have] very little to do with education.""Andy Miller, head teacher at St Nicholas Church of England Primary School in Blackpool, said the forced academisation plan had been a mistake. ""I would argue that head teachers, their governing bodies and their parent community actually know what's best for individual schools - rather than somebody in Westminster saying this is good for all of you,"" he said.National Association of Head Teachers president Kim Johnson said his organisation wanted ministers to understand ""that actually there isn't a case of one size fits all"" for schools. ""We're the intelligent practitioners and we want that opportunity, at the table with government, to further those discussions."" Tory backbencher Graham Brady, who welcomed the abandonment of the plans, said that ""the more that we can have these debates and discussions before legislation is brought forward, the better"".Alasdair Smith, from campaign group Anti Academies Alliance, said: ""We've known for more than 30 years exactly what improves schools, and it's not rocket science, it's high quality teaching and learning and good leadership. ""The government has not been pursuing that agenda, they've been pursuing structural change, and they've ignored high quality teaching, and high quality leadership, and that's why the policy is now in tatters.""Academies are independently run - but state-funded - schools, overseen by a not-for-profit business, known as an academy trust. They are often part of a chain.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said scrapping the plans was ""frankly a humiliating climbdown for David Cameron and his education secretary"".However, the government said it would push forward with compelling academy conversions in two areas:The government also announced measures to protect small rural schools including extra financial support and a requirement that any closure would have to be agreed by the local authority and the regional schools commissioner."
2016-05-09,SNP celebrate - as Labour 'hang on',https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36218450,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has downplayed talk of another independence referendum after winning the party's third election victory in a row.Confirming she would form a minority government at Holyrood, she said her aim was to ""persuade, not to divide"". Despite Labour coming third in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party had ""hung on"" and done better than expected in Wales and England.Sadiq Khan leads the London Mayoral election as counting continues.With all the results declared in Scotland, the SNP is the largest party with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24.Labour remains the dominant party in Wales, winning 29 out of 60 seats, but falling just short of a majority. Plaid Cymru pipped the Tories to be the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly while UKIP won seven seats on a good night for the party.Counting continues across English councils but the BBC is forecasting that, on the basis of the results so far, Labour would have got a 31% projected share of the national vote, with the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.Elections expert John Curtice said the result - calculated on the basis the UK electorate as a whole had behaved in the same way as voters did in the English local elections - was slightly better than Labour might have expected.In the London Mayoral race, a live update of the vote tally shows Labour candidate Sadiq Khan currently ahead of his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. In Northern Ireland, the first results for the assembly election are being declared with the final result due on Saturday. Tap here to search for election results in your area.Speaking in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said that despite falling two seats short of a majority, the SNP had secured an ""emphatic"" victory and had a ""clear and unequivocal"" mandate. She said the party would govern on its own rather than in alliance with other parties. On the issue of a future vote on independence, she said the SNP will make ""our case with passion, with patience but will always respect the opinion of the people"".But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said any prospect of the issue being reopened in the next five years had been ""utterly shredded"" by the SNP's failure to win a majority. Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.But nor is there much evidence of enthusiasm for the Conservative government in England. The Tories so far have picked up a handful of seats, traditionally an achievement for a party in power at these kinds of polls.But for success, and unexpected success, the Conservatives can look to Scotland where it appears they are set to take second place, - a fundamental change in Scotland. But there, voters again expressed their faith and belief in the Scottish National Party as their government.Read more from LauraIn the English council elections, BBC analysis suggests the Tory vote fell in southern England, which may have helped Labour to retain control of councils in areas such as Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where its vote was looking vulnerable.Labour's vote share is down about 6% on average on 2012  - the last time these seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But a BBC analysis suggests its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.Its share was more sharply down in Scotland. The party gained one seat from the SNP - Edinburgh Southern - but failed to take other targets and was beaten into third place by the Conservatives - a result that would have been unthinkable in the past.Labour also lost its Rhondda Welsh Assembly seat, in its south Wales heartlands, to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In other developments:Brighter news for Labour came with it holding the seat of Sheffield Brightside in a Westminster by-election, with UKIP coming second. The party also held Ogmore in another Parliamentary by-election, in South Wales, with UKIP again in second place. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Corbyn said it had ""grown support"" in parts of England but he acknowledged the scale of the defeat in Scotland, saying there was a ""lot of building"" to do. Amid speculation about Mr Corbyn's future, his deputy Tom Watson said he needed ""more time"" to show he could revive Labour fortunes.But MP Michael Dugher said Labour was ""not on a trajectory"" to victory in 2020 while shadow scottish secretary Ian Murray suggested the public did not see Labour ""at the moment as being a credible party of future government"". For the Conservatives, the highlights of the evening were in Scotland, winning the Holyrood seat of Eastwood from Labour and Ruth Davidson's winning Edinburgh Central from the SNP.David Cameron said the party's second place in Scotland and its showing in England, where it took control of Peterborough Council and won council seats in key Westminster marginals such as Dudley and Nuneaton, represented a good result for a party in government for six years.""Local election day for sitting prime ministers is supposed to be a day of dread, waiting for the knock on the door like a condemned man waiting for a hangman,"" he said. ""But that's wasn't what it was like last night.""In a surprise result in Wales, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood unseated Labour's Leighton Andrews in the Rhondda - described by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain as ""a terrible shock for us in Welsh Labour"".Ms Wood said: ""A new dawn has already broken over the Valleys, people have voted for change.""In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, while Plaid Cymru is up by two points.The big story of the night in Wales was the performance of UKIP, which saw its vote increase by 12 points. The party's leader Nigel Farage hailed it as a significant breakthrough. In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs. The majority of the seats were last contested in 2012.Thursday's polls were the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020, with 43 million people entitled to take part.What's still to come (all timings are estimates)Friday 6 May11:30 onwards: Forty four councils in England declaring on Friday15:00: First results of London Assembly elections17:00: First preference vote share information for elections to Northern Ireland Assembly1800: Result of first preference votes for Mayor of London (final result expected early evening)Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England and Salford mayoral contest are also expected on Friday.Saturday 7 May14:00 Results from five remaining councils in England16:00 Result of Bristol Mayoral contestResult of elections to Northern Ireland Assembly expectedSunday 8 May16:00 Result of elections to Bristol Council (final council in England to declare)Results of Police and Crime Commissioner elections in Wales"
2016-05-09,DUP past 30 seats in NI Assembly election,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-northern-ireland-36212550,"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has passed the 30-seats mark after the first day of counting in the Northern Ireland Assembly election.Three-quarters of the 108 seats have been filled, with the DUP on 33.Eleven constituencies have been fully declared, and counting has ended for the night in seven areas.So far, Sinn Féin has 19 seats, Ulster Unionists have 10, the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) has nine and the Alliance Party has six.Passing the 30-seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.Gerry Carroll won a first ever assembly seat for the People Before Profit Alliance, topping the poll in West Belfast for the left-wing party to take one of the five seats Sinn Féin had held in the constituency.The SDLP's Alex Attwood retained his West Belfast seat by a narrow margin, overcoming DUP challenger Frank McCoubrey by just 89 votes.Mr Carroll said his success was evidence that voters had become ""fed-up with the status quo"" and were ""looking for a political alternative"".He was joined by his party colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann, who was elected in Foyle, taking a seat from the SDLP.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in his home constituency of Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat when he was eliminated after the first count, but he said his his nine years as an MLA had been a ""privilege"".He was twice elected as an Ulster Unionist but left the party in 2013 to form the ill-fated NI21, which imploded just over a year later.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said he was ""stunned"" to top the Strangford poll, but acknowledged that he had been ""ambitious"" with his prediction of the number of seats his party would win.Alliance Party leader David Ford crossed the line in South Antrim and Jim Allister, who leads the Traditional Unionist Voice, was re-elected in North Antrim.Former MP Naomi Long will return to frontline politics after her election for the Alliance Party in East Belfast, where she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP last year.The DUP's Joanne Bunting has taken the East Belfast seat vacated by former first minister Peter Robinson, who retired earlier this year.In South Belfast, the city's former lord mayor Máirtín Ó Muilleoir was elected after topping the poll and Claire Bailey gained a seat in the constituency for the Green Party, saying she wanted to ""change the conversation at Stormont"".The DUP also made a gain in the constituency, with councillor Christopher Stalford taking the seat that had been held by the UUP.Jenny Palmer, a councillor who left the DUP last year after claiming she had been bullied, took a seat off her former party when she was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.Former agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew, who left the assembly to serve as an MP, will return to Stormont after her election for Sinn Féin in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.William Irwin of the DUP came top of the poll Newry and Armagh, while former Armagh gaelic footballer Justin McNulty will be another new face in the assembly for the SDLP after securing his party's single seat in the constituency.Three Sinn Féin candidates came through in Mid Ulster, but the DUP's McCrea dynasty came to an end when Ian, the son of former MP and MLA William, lost his seat to party colleague Keith Buchanan.Former health minister Jim Wells, who has endured a series of controversies in the past two years, was re-elected in South Down.He made a formal complaint to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland after his wife and the husband of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) candidate Sinéad Bradley were denied entry to the count.The leaders of the two largest parties in Northern Ireland will be delighted by the results so far.The DUP is on course to hold the seats it took in 2011 and Sinn Féin are hopeful they will better their 2011 election when they won 29 seats.In contrast, it has been a disappointing day for the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates have been competing across Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies.In all, 703,744 people voted in the election, representing a turnout of 54.91%, which was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.In general terms, turnout in eastern constituencies has increased compared to 2011, but dropped in western constituencies.More than 2,000 staff are involved in counting the votes in eight centres across Northern Ireland.In Northern Ireland, MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation.Seven counts will resume on Saturday morning, with the final seats not due to be declared later in the day."
2016-05-09,Police probe Tory election expenses,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36231138,"Eight police forces are investigating whether Conservative MPs filed election expenses illegally after the 2015 General Election, the BBC understands.The allegations centre around failing to register the accommodation costs of party activists who were involved in the ""battle bus"" operation. The party has blamed an ""administrative error"".A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.The activists on the party's battle bus targeted marginal seats. The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.Failing to file correct expenses is a criminal offence.The eight forces actively investigating are West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, Greater Manchester Police, Devon and Cornwall Police, Gloucestershire Police, Northamptonshire Police, Staffordshire Police, and Cheshire Police.A further four forces are waiting for further information, the BBC understands.Police can investigate such claims up to a year after the election expenses were filed, and West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, and Greater Manchester Police have started the process of getting extensions to the time limit.A Conservative spokesperson said: ""As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus. ""However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return.  ""The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. ""Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning.""The Electoral Commission - which is an independent body that sets standards for running elections - is also investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act during the general election.The Commission has powers in relation to national campaign spending, although its sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance at the Electoral Commission, said: ""The police and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. ""We have requested that they consider doing this."" "
2016-05-09,"Labour's 'hung on', Jeremy Corbyn says",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36228094,"Jeremy Corbyn said his party had ""hung on"" and defied predictions of local election losses in England.The Labour leader hailed an ""excellent"" result in Wales and pledged to ""walk hand in hand"" with Scottish colleagues after they slipped to third behind the Conservatives.Labour retained control of several key councils in England and remained the largest party in Wales.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told ""begrudgers"" to ""put up or shut up"".Pollsters had predicted losses for Labour in the local elections, with the party defending gains it made in 2012 under Ed Miliband.Speaking alongside Gill Furniss, who won Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough in one of two Labour Parliamentary by-election holds, Mr Corbyn said: ""All across England last night we were getting predictions that we were going to lose councils. We didn't.""We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places.""He congratulated the ""hard work"" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: ""There is a lot of building to do in Scotland. ""We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again.""They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a ""weak leader"" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as ""shocking"". The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.""We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats,"" Tim Roache, its general secretary said.

2016-05-09,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-09,The Sadiq Khan story,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36140479,"Labour's Sadiq Khan has been elected as London's new mayor - but who is the man who will be in charge of the UK's capital city for the next four years?Sadiq Khan's life to date has been characterised by beating the odds - which is what he has just done to become mayor of London.When Labour politicians put themselves forward to run for mayor last year, Mr Khan was far from being the favourite. The bookies' money was on Baroness Jowell, a veteran of the Tony Blair years who had helped bring the Olympics to London. But if there is a pattern in Mr Khan's career, it's one of coming from behind. The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. Age: 45Marital status: Married with two daughtersPolitical party: LabourTime as MP: Has represented Tooting in south London since 2005Previous jobs: Human rights solicitor, chair of Liberty""Son of a bus driver"" became one of the most hackneyed phrases in Mr Khan's time on the stump - so overused in his leaflets and speeches that he was eventually forced to make fun of his own campaign, joking he had given the Daily Mirror an ""exclusive"" on his background. But his parents' story holds real significance for him. Amanullah and Sehrun Khan emigrated from Pakistan to London shortly before Sadiq was born, in 1970. He was the fifth of their eight children - seven sons and a daughter. He has often said that his early impressions of the world of work shaped his belief in the trade union movement. His father, a bus driver for 25 years, ""was in a union and got decent pay and conditions"" whereas his mum, a stay-at-home seamstress, ""wasn't, and didn't"".He lived with his parents and siblings in a cramped three-bedroomed house on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield, south-west London, sharing a bunkbed with one of his brothers until he left home in his 20s. He attended the local comprehensive, Ernest Bevin College, which he describes as ""a tough school - it wasn't always a bed of roses"". The nickname ""Bevin boys"" was at that time in that part of south London a byword for bad behaviour.It was at school that he first began to gravitate towards politics, joining the Labour Party aged 15. He credits the school's head, Naz Bokhari, who happened to be the first Muslim headteacher at a UK secondary school, with making him realise ""skin colour or background wasn't a barrier to making something with your life"".Mr Khan was raised a Muslim and has never shied away from acknowledging the importance of his faith. In his maiden speech as an MP he spoke about his father teaching him Mohammed's sayings, or hadiths - in particular the principle that ""if one sees something wrong, one has the duty to try to change it"".He was an able student who loved football, boxing and cricket - he even had a trial for Surrey County Cricket Club as a teenager. He has since spoken about the racist abuse he and his brothers faced at Wimbledon and Chelsea football matches, saying he felt ""safer"" watching at home and became a Liverpool fan simply ""because they were playing such great football at the time"".He studied maths and science at A-level with the idea of becoming a dentist. He was switched on to law by a teacher who told him ""you're always arguing"" - and by the TV programme LA Law, starring Jimmy Smits as Victor Sifuentes, a charismatic partner in a California law firm.""LA law was about lawyers in LA who do great cases, act for the underdog, drove nice cars, look great and I wanted to be Sifuentes,"" Mr Khan told Business Insider recently.He studied law at the University of North London and put his degree to good use straight away, becoming a trainee solicitor in 1994 at Christian Fisher under the human rights lawyer Louise Christian. The same year he met and married his wife Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor and coincidentally the daughter of a bus driver - with whom he went on to have two daughters, Anisah and Ammarah. He also began his 12-year stint as a councillor for Tooting, encouraged by Guyanan-born local activist Bert Luthers.Just three years later, aged 27, he was made an equity partner and the firm was renamed Christian Khan.During this time he worked on a number of high-profile cases: he won compensation for Kenneth Hsu, a hairdresser wrongly arrested and assaulted by the police; teachers and lawyers who had experienced racial discrimination; Leroy Logan, a senior black police officer accused of fraud; corrupt former Met Police commander Ali Dizaei; and helped overturn an exclusion order (later upheld on appeal) on US political activist Louis Farrakhan.The irony of a man who represented people in cases against the Met going on to become the force's chief scrutineer has not been lost on his opponents. Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith, speaking at an event alongside Home Secretary Theresa May, recently characterised Mr Khan's legal career as ""coaching people in suing our police"".He left his law firm somewhat abruptly in 2004, afterwards telling the Law Gazette: ""If you're in government, you're a legislator and you have the opportunity to make laws that can improve things for millions of people.""In 2005, Mr Khan fought and retained the marginal seat of Tooting for Labour, one of five new ethnic minority MPs elected that year.Contemporaries on either side of the political divide remember being impressed by a ""fiercely bright"" and ""persuasive"" individual who was ""impossible not to listen to"". He combines that sharpness with what is often called his ""cheeky chappy"" demeanour. He is fond of calling people ""mate"" and has even done so on the floor of the Commons.Two months after he entered the Commons, he was thrust into the limelight by the 7 July bombings. When Parliament met to discuss the attacks, he told MPs: ""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted on Thursday; proud of the way ordinary courageous Londoners carried on with their business and stopped the criminals disrupting our life.""In a 2010 Guardian interview, he recalled thinking: ""I couldn't hide - and I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but there were so few articulate voices of reason from the British Muslim community. ""There were angry men with beards, but nobody saying, 'Actually, I'm very comfortable being a Brit, being a Muslim, being a Londoner'."" The intervention marked him out as one to watch, but his path to promotion was not altogether smooth. Mr Khan wore his civil liberties credentials on his sleeve, challenging the government over ID cards and joining 48 other Labour rebels to vote against prime minister Tony Blair's plan to allow the detention of terror suspects without charge for up to 90 days. He later claimed party chiefs had penalised him by preventing him from visiting Pakistan in the wake of an earthquake there and did not want to give him an office with a sofa.But the rebellion was not altogether to his disadvantage. Tony Blair was on his way out, and Mr Khan was able to position himself on the ascendant ""soft left"" of the Labour party alongside Ed Balls and Gordon Brown. ""It was a tough school; it wasn't always a bed of roses. But you become street wise, you become savvy and you learn social skills - you learn about how to deal with people."" - on his schooldays""The way allegations of misconduct against police officers are investigated is flawed and inadequate."" - as a human rights solicitor""Although I'd won cases at the European Court of Human Rights, and I'd won cases in the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal, I still couldn't escape the fact that if you're part of the legislature and the executive, you can make legislation that improves the quality of life for literally millions of people."" - on leaving law to become an MP""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted."" - on the 7/7 attacks""Most people feel nagged by their parents from time to time, but very rarely is it about the future of bus regulation."" - on his father ""I sleep in my own bed. When I get home I put the rubbish out and get my girls up to go to school."" - on staying grounded""For the last eight years you've seen a red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hand. I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners."" - on launching his mayoral bidWhen Gordon Brown took over at Number 10, Mr Khan was given his first job in government as a whip and then as communities minister, a move that created disquiet among some other MPs in the capital who had been around for longer.A post at the Department for Transport followed in 2009 and he became the first Muslim in the Cabinet. This was at a time when there were only four Muslim MPs and he was often confused for international development minister Shahid Malik.He would go on to claim during the mayoral campaign that as transport minister he had ""pushed"" Crossrail through Parliament, but the Mayorwatch website has shown Mr Khan only took on responsibility for the project after the relevant bill had become law. At the 2010 election, Mr Khan's own majority was squeezed to an uncomfortably small margin of just 2,524 votes and Labour was out of government for the first time in 13 years.In the chaotic months of Labour soul-searching that followed, he again showed a canny ability to ally himself with what was seemingly a lost cause and turn it into success.True to his Brownite colours, he was chosen as Ed Miliband's campaign manager and helped steer the less-favoured Miliband brother towards an unexpected leadership election victory.He told the New Statesman afterwards that the night before the result, he told Miliband to ""prepare for defeat"". ""I learned this from (television series) Rumpole of the Bailey,"" he said. ""Always tell your client he's going to lose because, if he loses, he's expecting it; if he wins, you're the fantastic lawyer who got the victory."" However, he added: ""I had a feeling we'd done it.""In that contest, as in the Labour mayoral nomination, Mr Khan's support for the trade union movement helped his campaign secure crucial votes.He was rewarded with the post of shadow justice secretary - a role in which he did not get off to an auspicious start. His first major speech was badly received when he chose to highlight Labour's failings in government, and in then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke he faced an adversary with whom he admitted he struggled to find things to disagree about.His other brief as shadow political reform minister did not provide much of a chance to shine either, as the coalition needed little help killing off its own proposals for Lords reform and his personal support for changes to the voting system was tempered by his view that the referendum on this - which saw the British public reject change - came at the wrong time.When Mr Clarke was sacked and replaced with Chris Grayling, however, Mr Khan was able to take the fight to the despatch box more convincingly as a vocal opponent of reforms to legal aid and restrictions on books in prisons.When the Conservatives later reversed several of Mr Grayling's flagship policies he described it as a ""huge climbdown"" that showed Labour had been right to resist them.Labour's disastrous showing in the 2015 election and the swift resignation of Ed Miliband - the man he had helped to the leadership - could have thrown Mr Khan off-course, but he found a new focus for his campaigning energy.Just a week after the election he announced he would seek the Labour nomination for mayor. He had already been tipped as a possible contender at least a year but, with typical shrewdness, he had steadfastly refused to be drawn on the subject in public while sounding out MPs and councillors in private to see if he had enough support.Once he had confirmed his mayoral ambitions, his quest for the nomination - let alone an election win - still seemed like a long shot. Baroness Jowell, who had been MP for Dulwich and West Norwood for 23 years and held a number of senior ministerial positions under Labour, was widely seen as the natural choice.That received wisdom was upended during the Labour leadership contest, when commentators predicted the influx of new members into the party over the summer of ""Corbynmania"" could play into Mr Khan's hands. He would take some flak over his role in Jeremy Corbyn's election as party leader, as he nominated him but later voted for Andy Burnham. In the event, however, Mr Khan came out top as Labour choice of candidate not just with new members but in all three groups who could vote. It was a remarkable victory which, as the BBC's Norman Smith observed on the day, surprised him as much as it did his rivals.The campaign that ensued was bloody. A former aide to long-time Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, Ayesha Hazarika, reflected that when Zac Goldsmith - who had a reputation for being decent, attractive and independent-minded - was first picked as the Conservative candidate there was despondency in Labour ranks.Mr Khan said himself at one hustings that he thought his opponent had been a ""nice guy until [Conservative strategist] Sir Lynton Crosby got his hands on him"". Whoever came up with the approach, Mr Goldsmith's campaign focused heavily on portraying Mr Khan as an associate of ""extremists"" - which in turn allowed Labour to attack the Conservatives for pursuing ""divisive, dog-whistle"" tactics. Mr Khan took this to be an attempt to smear him by association because of his religion. The Conservatives insisted they were talking about his brand of left-wing politics - but Mr Goldsmith repeatedly said the Labour candidate had ""given platform, oxygen and cover to extremists"".It became a source of such bitter tension between the two camps that when David Cameron stuck up for Mr Goldsmith's campaign at prime minister's questions he found the word ""racist"" flung back at him from the Labour benches.While polls consistently suggested Mr Khan was ahead, Labour pessimists and Conservative optimists would remind themselves that Mr Goldsmith was likely to benefit from a Tory incumbency, from lower turnout among groups that tended to vote Labour, and from the under-reporting of Conservative support seen at the 2015 general election.But those things were not enough - or proved not to be the case at all. Voter turnout was 45%, an increase of 7% on 2012, and it was clear quite early on in the day that Mr Khan had a healthy lead over his Conservative rival.Another London Labour MP born to immigrant parents, David Lammy, told the BBC Mr Khan's election was a ""huge moment"" and predicted: ""If we ever see a black or Asian prime minister in this country I have no doubt they will owe an enormous debt to Sadiq Khan.""Now, the boy from Tooting will have to prove himself all over again. Love them or loathe them, the mayor's predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone - the only other men to have done the job - are political heavyweights. Even within his own party, Mr Khan has been accused of lacking vision. The perception of him as inexperienced also lingers on.One close Labour ally pointed out that ""unlike Ken, he has held ministerial office - but more than that, he represents the future. Unlike Boris he'll be wholly focused on getting results for London - this isn't just a stepping stone for his career"".She predicted he would be anxious to make good on the ambitious promises he made during the campaign, particularly on addressing London's housing problems.If that were not enough to be getting on with, he faces a dilemma over how to navigate between co-operating with the Conservative government and teaming up with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in condemnation of the Tories.In this respect he may hope to repeat the tactics of Boris Johnson, who managed to pull off alternately angering and assisting the government. If he is to succeed he will need to display the same knack for steering his own course as he has shown as a schoolboy, a campaigning lawyer, a backbench MP and a shadow minister.But those who voted for him will not forget his emphasis on his own disadvantaged background, his speeches about social justice and his promise to be a ""mayor for all Londoners""."
2016-05-09,Independence loss,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36227731,"It never feels good for any politician to wake up the morning after an election defeat. Today it's hard to imagine many senior Labour figures got much sleep at all last night. No doubt lying awake contemplating their humiliating defeat by the Tories who knocked them decisively into third place. But also having to ask deeper existential questions about whether there is still a place for the Labour party in the Scottish political landscape.Labour can spend the next few days and weeks asking if it was their polices that voters didn't like. Was it a mistake to offer to raise income tax for almost every taxpayer in Scotland? Was it their young and inexperienced leader who has only been in the job nine short months? Was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership a factor?But arguments over their manifesto or personalities are to miss the point. This election was clearly about the constitution. Scottish politics are still totally dominated by the independence question which was certainly not settled on 18 September 2014 and still seems to take precedence in voters' minds over any other issue. And it's an issue on which Labour cannot win.""We have to get our story straight on where we stand on independence"", is what very depressed Labour figures were telling me on Thursday night. But they had different ideas about what that story should be.Labour can never form another government in Holyrood or win back many of their Westminster seats unless they appeal to former Labour voters who have now decided they favour an independent Scotland and are currently voting SNP. But what we learned last night was that if Labour don't take a hard line on their support for the union they haemorrhage votes to the Tories. Labour tried to reach out to Yes voters by saying that if there was another referendum Labour politicians would be free to campaign on either side. Kezia Dugdale even suggested in one interview that she might consider voting for independence in the event of a Brexit but then tried to row back from that - whilst also saying that she resolutely opposed the idea of having another referendum and would vigorously campaign for a no vote if there was to be another indyref.That left space for the Tories to proclaim themselves the only true party of the Union. They accused Labour of being soft on independence and it seems to have worked. The roughly 10% of voters the Tories seem to have grabbed from Labour are largely unionists who wanted to express their opposition to independence at the ballot box once more. So where does that leave Labour? If the SNP are the party of independence and the Tories the party of the union, what is the point of the Labour Party? They will continue to argue that they care most about social justice and poverty. But as long as voters remain split over the constitution that may not win back many voters.   One small consolation for Scottish labour leader Kezia Dugdale - it seems unlikely she will face a leadership challenge even despite this terrible result. Why? Partly because Labour have finally realised changing leaders every time they lose an election hasn't helped. But mostly because no-one wants the job of Scottish labour leader right now. And who can blame them?"
2016-05-09,Political maps,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36215186,"What impact have the elections had on the political maps of London, Scotland, Wales and England?In London, Labour's Sadiq Khan defeated Conservative Zac Goldsmith to become mayor. Khan came out on top in three constituencies that had voted for former mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012. After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%.The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.Of the 14 London Assembly seats, Labour won nine, taking Merton and Wandsworth from the Conservatives, who held five boroughs.The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six, and the Lib Dems five.  Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour. But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP. The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies. The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament. That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.  Labour is likely to hang on to power in Wales, with just one constituency changing hands, as Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party. The biggest shift in Welsh politics overnight is the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	Although UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third. In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent. Voters in some parts in England have also been choosing their local councillors. A total of 124 councils are up for re-election, in part or in whole. After 115 results had been announced, Labour had lost 24 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, which is now under no overall control. The Conservatives had lost a total of 33 council seats, having been up on their previous total earlier, but have not lost control of any of the 28 councils up for re-election. The Lib Dems had gained 35 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control. UKIP had 26 more council seats - but had not been able to convert these gains into control of any council. At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.

        	In general, turnout was significantly lower in Wales, but it was highest at 56.8% in Cardiff North where Labour won with about 45% of the vote and Brecon and Radnorshire where the Lib Dems took more than half of the vote. The biggest increase in turnout in Wales was in the Rhondda, the only constituency seat that changed hands.

2016-05-09,Corbyn's future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36223968,"They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable.But the results were messier than they predicted.So when Jo Cox - the Batley MP who nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership to broaden the party's debate - says that Labour should have performed better at these elections, she has logic and precedence on her side. The party fared less well than the last time many of these seats were contested, in 2012, and Labour still went on to lose the subsequent general election.But it's not clear that the results provide enough ammunition for those who want to take aim at the leadership. Mr Corbyn's supporters will point out the party didn't hold on just in its northern heartlands, but in areas where it expected to lose - right down on the south coast, in Southampton and Hastings.His internal critics have been pointing out privately all night that beneath the surface, some of the results aren't anything to write home about. Labour retained overall control in Nuneaton for example, but lost ground to the Conservatives.  Crucially, though, the party's deputy leader Tom Watson made it clear he wasn't sanctioning any coup attempt with Mr Corbyn, who has been in the job for only eight months. He didn't think either winning - or losing - 100 seats should prove decisive, and he will have in mind that members and supporters who elected the Labour leader last September are unlikely to have been appalled at results which saw Labour retain control of Crawley. Since the 2014 referendum, Scotland tends to be viewed through a different prism. Unlike in England, Labour has to compete against another party describing itself as social-democratic: the SNP.But elsewhere in the UK, some Labour MPs, if not the new supporters of the party, will ask if there are lessons to be learnt from campaigning unsuccessfully on a platform of higher taxes for better public services.But a better guide to Labour's current weakness might be the Conservatives' strength.A governing party tearing itself apart from the grassroots to the cabinet table over Britain's relationship with the EU certainly looks like it will suffer some setbacks, notably in London.But it is on course for ending up with an increased tally of councillors - and very possibly becoming the official opposition in Scotland after years in the political wilderness.

2016-05-09,Team Khan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-london-36226252,"If many Londoners knew little about Sadiq Khan until this contest, it is likely they will know even less about the team that will help him govern at City Hall if he wins.Every mayor has the right to appoint two political advisers and up to 10 other staff, giving them a chance to surround themselves with trusted lieutenants and a chance to hit the ground running.So who might form Sadiq Khan's team to help him carry through on his campaign promises?It's likely the man who ran his campaign, David Bellamy, will continue as Khan's right-hand man as his chief of staff.And helping to deliver on the big issue of the election - housing - it's likely Mr Khan will stick with James Murray, an Islington councillor who advised the campaign on housing and stood in at debates for Mr Khan.There may also be a return to City Hall for Neale Coleman, an advisor to both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. Heavily involved in delivery the Olympics and its legacy, he briefly worked as head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn.Seen as capable and pragmatic, he's likely to have a role in settling Team Khan into the eight-floor offices. Another name being touted is that of Andrew Adonis - a former cabinet minister and currently the head of the National Infrastructure Commission.With big projects like Crossrail 2 and HS2 coming down the track, his expertise could prove key, but it may require him to walk away from the national job.If he's looking for a deputy mayor for policing, the smart money seems to be on current Assembly member Joanne McCartney, a trained barrister and Labour member for Enfield and Haringey, who has chaired the assembly's Police and Crime Committee.Fiona Twycross, who has worked on the Fire Authority, may also be rewarded.Former Bethnal Green MP Oona King, who backed Mr Khan when he first announced he was running, may enter City Hall in a communities role.Expect roles too for policy director Nick Bowes - widely seen as the ideas person behind the new mayor's campaign - and Leah Kreitzman and Jack Stenner, who have been key members of team Khan since he became Labour's candidate.Ex-journalist Patrick Hennessy, who ran communications for Mr Khan during the election campaign, is likely to continue selling the message."

That ""suggests that the statement in the government leaflet is not significantly affected by it"".It may seem odd that the impact is so small, given that the Netherlands is the third biggest customer for UK exports, behind the USA and Germany. But remember that the Rotterdam Effect only affects exports of goods, while the 44% figure is for both goods and services.Sir Andrew did suggest that a more prominent note in the statistics about the Rotterdam Effect would be helpful. In evidence to the parliamentary committee chaired by  Bernard Jenkin, he said that would be particularly important to people interested in the level of exports to the Netherlands rather than the whole EU.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"

""We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security, as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.""BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Khan's comments would be seen as a message not just to Jeremy Corbyn but also to the Labour leader's critics.As he took office as London mayor in a ceremony in Southwark Cathedral, Mr Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants, promised to ""make our city better"" and be ""a mayor for all Londoners"".He also pledged to lead ""the most transparent, engaged and accessible administration London has ever seen"".The former Labour minister's victory in London ends eight years of Conservative control of City Hall.Mr Corbyn welcomed Mr Rees' victory, saying in a tweet: ""Another Labour mayor who will stand up for their city!""But the Labour leader was absent from Mr Khan's swearing-in ceremony earlier on Saturday, travelling instead to Bristol to congratulate that city's new mayor Marvin Rees. ""I am meeting Sadiq over the weekend, I have been in touch with him. We are getting on fine. I have sent him a message of congratulations,"" the Labour leader said.In other results from Thursday's election, Nicola Sturgeon's SNP party celebrated its third successive victory in the Holyrood election - though the result left the SNP two seats short of a majority in the parliament.In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionists remain the biggest party in the Assembly, with Arlene Foster continuing as first minister.In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs.Labour's vote share was down about 6% on average on 2012 - the last time the seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, and Plaid Cymru is up by two points. UKIP increased its vote by 12 points and saw seven candidates elected.The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. The Sadiq Khan story"

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.""Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions""."
2016-05-10,Hamilton bid to lead UKIP in assembly,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-wales-36233182,"Neil Hamilton is expected to challenge Nathan Gill to lead UKIP's new assembly group, sources have told BBC Wales.The former Tory MP has denied a suggestion by a senior UKIP source that he will try to change party rules giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage sole power to appoint the leader in Wales. Current UKIP rules allow different politicians to lead the assembly group and the party in Wales.A source close to Mr Gill said he was confident most UKIP AMs would back him.Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill were among seven new UKIP AMs elected on Thursday.Gareth Bennett, Mark Reckless, David Rowlands and Mr Gill took the oath of office at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay on Saturday.Mr Hamilton and another newly-elected AM - Caroline Jones - were present but were not sworn in.Party sources expect Mr Hamilton to make the leadership challenge on Tuesday to Mr Gill, who was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Mr Farage in 2014. Mr Hamilton and Ms Jones are expected to take the oath on Tuesday morning, after attending a meeting of UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday.At the meeting they will stand down from the NEC, which is required under UKIP's rules now that they have become elected politicians.A senior UKIP source suggested Mr Hamilton might use the meeting to attempt to change party rules stating that UKIP's national leader has the sole power to appoint the party's leader in Wales.Mr Hamilton has denied he has such a plan.Earlier on Saturday, Mr Hamilton told BBC Radio Wales that UKIP AMs would agree next week who should lead their group.He stressed that Mr Gill was not automatically in charge and said there were ""many people in UKIP"" with the right skills for the the job.  ""We're going to have a collective discussion when we all meet together and we'll come up with a decision as to which of us is likely to be the most effective leader in the assembly,"" he said.Asked if he would be the best candidate, Mr Hamilton added: ""I, of course, have a lot of parliamentary experience and so has [fellow UKIP AM and ex-Tory MP] Mark Reckless.""I've been around in politics for a very long time at quite a high level, and we have many people in UKIP who've got the kind of skills which will be advantageous to a leader.   ""But I'm not going to pre-empt the discussions that we will have, probably on Tuesday.""First Minister Carwyn Jones is spending the weekend preparing to form a new government, after Labour won 29 of the 60 seats, losing just one to Plaid.The new assembly is expected to hold its first meeting next week. Discussions are ongoing between the parties to decide who should be presiding officer and deputy presiding officer, and take charge of assembly proceedings.The Conservative assembly group will meet on Monday to discuss strategy, after a disappointing election under Welsh leader Andrew RT Davies.The party failed to win any target seats and lost three to fall into third place behind Plaid Cymru.Monmouth AM Nick Ramsay said the Conservatives' problems could not be ""brushed under the table"" and the leadership needed to be discussed.He called it a ""difficult"" campaign but backed Mr Davies.""The 11 of us that are now left need to look at where we go from here,"" he said.""[We need to] decide how we get there and then look at all issues, including the leadership, but other issues as well such as the strategy the group adopts.""A Welsh Conservative spokesman described the campaign as ""very positive"" and ""ambitious"" with ""great ideas"".""There's a fifth party in play now, which has affected everyone else,"" he said, referring to UKIP.""We've proven we can challenge in key seats next time around.""Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party would be ""constructive but playing the crucial role of a strong opposition"" to Labour. ""We will use that wisely to put forward a vision for the country which is as clear now as it was the day before the election,"" he said.Kirsty Williams, the only surviving Lib Dem AM, has resigned as leader of the party in Wales after it lost four of its five Senedd seats.Labour looks likely to form another minority Labour administration after an election in which only one constituency changed hands.And yet, the election has revealed a big change in Welsh politics - a change that has arrived in Cardiff Bay in the form of seven UKIP AMs who won seats on the regional lists.They say they want to shake the place up. But Nigel Farage also says they want to play a constructive role.I'm not sure how you achieve both.Either way, there's a question facing UKIP - who will lead them in Wales?Nathan Gill was appointed UKIP Wales leader by Nigel Farage in 2014 - a job he's compared to ""herding cats"".It sounds as though Neil Hamilton - the former Tory MP whose political career has been re-booted by this election - would be only too happy to relieve him of his duty.But his elevation is unlikely to heal rifts in the party. Even the suggestion that he could be a candidate in this election caused a row in UKIP's ranks."
2016-05-10,Doctors to decide on NHS contract talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36234731,"Junior doctor representatives at the British Medical Association (BMA) will meet later to decide whether to hold talks with the government over a disputed new NHS employment contract.Negotiations over the contract broke down in February and junior doctors have staged several strikes since then.Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they could focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours.The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says there should be no preconditions.The government says it is willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA agreed in principle to the idea of restarting talks and also to a possible deferral of any new threat of strikes for five days.BBC health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be ""clarity about the next steps by the end of the day"".  On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday."" Mr Hunt had accused the BMA of refusing to negotiate over Saturday pay and said he would press on with introducing the contract.The BMA said there were wider unresolved issues over working hours and it was unfair to impose a contract rather than continue discussions.Between January and early April there were four strikes by junior doctors in England affecting routine but not urgent care.Last week, there were two one-day strikes affecting all forms of care, including emergencies - the first such action in the history of the NHS."

The final count in Upper Bann ended on Saturday afternoon.Northern Ireland Assembly election resultsThe DUP has 38 seats, while Sinn Féin has 28, the Ulster Unionists 16, SDLP 12 and the Alliance Party eight.The Greens and People Before Profit Alliance have two seats each. The TUV leader Jim Allister remains its sole representative.In terms of the last assembly, the DUP holds the same number of seats and Sinn Féin has dropped one seat.It has been a difficult election for both the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.In the end, the Ulster Unionists ended up with the same number of seats as before, but the SDLP lost two seats, one in Foyle and the other, after a marathon counting session, was Dolores Kelly's seat in Upper Bann.DUP leader Mrs Foster said: ""I'm absolutely delighted with the mandate that my party has been given to drive forward Northern Ireland into the future."" ""Of course, people have spoken and they have spoken very clearly.""Looking at the Sinn Féin strategy in this election, Gerry Kelly said: ""I think what we will do is take it constituency by constituency and look at vote management and all of the rest of it. I think, to a great extent, that the vote management wasn't that bad.""Moments from count centres across Northern IrelandHe said his part knew that Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit would take the seat in West Belfast.""We agree with what a lot of what People Before Profit say. There are some things we disagree with. We said we would work with them in the south and we will certainly work with them in the north."" UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said his party's campaign had been neither a success, nor a failure. He said the party would return 16 seats, the same as in 2011, but signalled a ""change of personnel"".SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party had been left with ""a lot of work to do"".  ""All of us need to learn lessons that Stormont is not delivering and people are not happy about that,"" he said.""We've had a rough couple of years, we've begun to change the face of the party and we're going to build from here.""BBC's Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler's view of the future assembly Alliance Party leader David Ford said his party had had a ""safe enough election compared to other parties"" and he was now concerned about shaping a programme for government that's ""inclusive and will promote the needs of all people in Northern Ireland"".Gerry Carroll won People Before Profit's first ever assembly seat in West Belfast at the expense of Sinn Féin.Anti-austerity party picks up seatsHe was followed by his colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann who took a seat from the SDLP in Foyle to secure his place at Stormont.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.The DUP's Frank McCoubrey came within 89 votes of winning a first unionist seat in West Belfast since the 2003 election, but he just lost out to Alex Attwood of the SDLP.Jim Allister retained his North Antrim seat for the Traditional Unionist Voice and Claire Bailey secured one for the Green Party in South Belfast.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt came out on top in the Strangford poll.But he said his pre-election prediction of the number of seats his party would win had been ""ambitious"".Naomi Long will return to Stormont for the Alliance Party, winning in East Belfast a year after she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP in the same constituency.Passing the 30 seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.But it lost a seat to Jenny Palmer, one of its former councillors who left the party last year after claiming she had been bullied. She was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.West Tyrone declared its first seat on Saturday - the SDLP's Daniel McCrossan - after the eighth count.Several MLAs from the previous assembly will not be returning to Stormont, with the independent John McCallister, the DUP's Ian McCrea and Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin among the most high-profile figures to lose their seats.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates stood in Thursday's election, with 108 seats in Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies up for grabs.In all, 703,744 people voted, and the turnout of 54.91% was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation, and about 2,000 count staff have been working at eight centres across Northern Ireland."
2016-05-10,Unions hail scrapping of academy plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36234989,"Teaching unions have welcomed the government's decision to ditch plans to force all state schools in England to become academies.  They said the move was recognition that ""one size"" did not fit all schools.Ministers said the government had listened to critics but the goal to turn schools into academies remained. Schools judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding will now not have to become academies, nor will small rural schools have to join a multi-academy trust.  The forced academisation proposals had been opposed by some Conservative MPs and councillors, as well as by unions and others. The government argues that academies drive up standards by giving more power to head teachers and allowing them to be more innovative. Critics have contended that academisation amounts to privatising the education system and say it is simplistic to say academies raise standards. Cabinet minister Michael Fallon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have now decided, having listened to parents and governors and our backbenchers that there is a better route to it, which is not forcing every school immediately to become an academy.""He said academisation would now focus only on schools that were ""clearly failing"".Asked whether ministers had tried to ""bury"" the announcement on a busy day for news, Mr Fallon said it would not have been ""legally"" possible to issue it in the preceding days because of the ""purdah"" restrictions on the activities of civil servants in election periods. Paul Luxmoore, executive head teacher of the Coastal Academies Trust in Kent, told Today he was ""dismayed"" at the policy reversal.""We've reached the tipping point, where local authorities - who have been delivering school improvements to schools until now - no longer have the capacity, or the money to do that effectively. Hence the government policy to make all schools academies over the next four years was entirely predictable and entirely sensible,"" he said.""I think they've lost their courage to go ahead with it because of all sorts of other political reasons [that have] very little to do with education.""Andy Miller, head teacher at St Nicholas Church of England Primary School in Blackpool, said the forced academisation plan had been a mistake. ""I would argue that head teachers, their governing bodies and their parent community actually know what's best for individual schools - rather than somebody in Westminster saying this is good for all of you,"" he said.National Association of Head Teachers president Kim Johnson said his organisation wanted ministers to understand ""that actually there isn't a case of one size fits all"" for schools. ""We're the intelligent practitioners and we want that opportunity, at the table with government, to further those discussions."" Tory backbencher Graham Brady, who welcomed the abandonment of the plans, said that ""the more that we can have these debates and discussions before legislation is brought forward, the better"".Alasdair Smith, from campaign group Anti Academies Alliance, said: ""We've known for more than 30 years exactly what improves schools, and it's not rocket science, it's high quality teaching and learning and good leadership. ""The government has not been pursuing that agenda, they've been pursuing structural change, and they've ignored high quality teaching, and high quality leadership, and that's why the policy is now in tatters.""Academies are independently run - but state-funded - schools, overseen by a not-for-profit business, known as an academy trust. They are often part of a chain.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said scrapping the plans was ""frankly a humiliating climbdown for David Cameron and his education secretary"".However, the government said it would push forward with compelling academy conversions in two areas:The government also announced measures to protect small rural schools including extra financial support and a requirement that any closure would have to be agreed by the local authority and the regional schools commissioner."
2016-05-10,SNP celebrate - as Labour 'hang on',https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36218450,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has downplayed talk of another independence referendum after winning the party's third election victory in a row.Confirming she would form a minority government at Holyrood, she said her aim was to ""persuade, not to divide"". Despite Labour coming third in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn insisted the party had ""hung on"" and done better than expected in Wales and England.Sadiq Khan leads the London Mayoral election as counting continues.With all the results declared in Scotland, the SNP is the largest party with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24.Labour remains the dominant party in Wales, winning 29 out of 60 seats, but falling just short of a majority. Plaid Cymru pipped the Tories to be the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly while UKIP won seven seats on a good night for the party.Counting continues across English councils but the BBC is forecasting that, on the basis of the results so far, Labour would have got a 31% projected share of the national vote, with the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.Elections expert John Curtice said the result - calculated on the basis the UK electorate as a whole had behaved in the same way as voters did in the English local elections - was slightly better than Labour might have expected.In the London Mayoral race, a live update of the vote tally shows Labour candidate Sadiq Khan currently ahead of his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. In Northern Ireland, the first results for the assembly election are being declared with the final result due on Saturday. Tap here to search for election results in your area.Speaking in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said that despite falling two seats short of a majority, the SNP had secured an ""emphatic"" victory and had a ""clear and unequivocal"" mandate. She said the party would govern on its own rather than in alliance with other parties. On the issue of a future vote on independence, she said the SNP will make ""our case with passion, with patience but will always respect the opinion of the people"".But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said any prospect of the issue being reopened in the next five years had been ""utterly shredded"" by the SNP's failure to win a majority. Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.But nor is there much evidence of enthusiasm for the Conservative government in England. The Tories so far have picked up a handful of seats, traditionally an achievement for a party in power at these kinds of polls.But for success, and unexpected success, the Conservatives can look to Scotland where it appears they are set to take second place, - a fundamental change in Scotland. But there, voters again expressed their faith and belief in the Scottish National Party as their government.Read more from LauraIn the English council elections, BBC analysis suggests the Tory vote fell in southern England, which may have helped Labour to retain control of councils in areas such as Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where its vote was looking vulnerable.Labour's vote share is down about 6% on average on 2012  - the last time these seats in England were contested - with 24 fewer councillors. But a BBC analysis suggests its share is up 4% on the general election in key wards, with the Conservatives down by a similar amount.Its share was more sharply down in Scotland. The party gained one seat from the SNP - Edinburgh Southern - but failed to take other targets and was beaten into third place by the Conservatives - a result that would have been unthinkable in the past.Labour also lost its Rhondda Welsh Assembly seat, in its south Wales heartlands, to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In other developments:Brighter news for Labour came with it holding the seat of Sheffield Brightside in a Westminster by-election, with UKIP coming second. The party also held Ogmore in another Parliamentary by-election, in South Wales, with UKIP again in second place. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Corbyn said it had ""grown support"" in parts of England but he acknowledged the scale of the defeat in Scotland, saying there was a ""lot of building"" to do. Amid speculation about Mr Corbyn's future, his deputy Tom Watson said he needed ""more time"" to show he could revive Labour fortunes.But MP Michael Dugher said Labour was ""not on a trajectory"" to victory in 2020 while shadow scottish secretary Ian Murray suggested the public did not see Labour ""at the moment as being a credible party of future government"". For the Conservatives, the highlights of the evening were in Scotland, winning the Holyrood seat of Eastwood from Labour and Ruth Davidson's winning Edinburgh Central from the SNP.David Cameron said the party's second place in Scotland and its showing in England, where it took control of Peterborough Council and won council seats in key Westminster marginals such as Dudley and Nuneaton, represented a good result for a party in government for six years.""Local election day for sitting prime ministers is supposed to be a day of dread, waiting for the knock on the door like a condemned man waiting for a hangman,"" he said. ""But that's wasn't what it was like last night.""In a surprise result in Wales, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood unseated Labour's Leighton Andrews in the Rhondda - described by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain as ""a terrible shock for us in Welsh Labour"".Ms Wood said: ""A new dawn has already broken over the Valleys, people have voted for change.""In Wales, Labour's vote is down by eight points overall, the Conservative vote is down by three points, while Plaid Cymru is up by two points.The big story of the night in Wales was the performance of UKIP, which saw its vote increase by 12 points. The party's leader Nigel Farage hailed it as a significant breakthrough. In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - were up for grabs.

has passed the 30-seats mark after the first day of counting in the Northern Ireland Assembly election.Three-quarters of the 108 seats have been filled, with the DUP on 33.Eleven constituencies have been fully declared, and counting has ended for the night in seven areas.So far, Sinn Féin has 19 seats, Ulster Unionists have 10, the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) has nine and the Alliance Party has six.Passing the 30-seats mark is significant for the DUP as it allows the party to deploy a petition of concern in the assembly, which effectively acts as a veto against proposals that its MLAs oppose.Gerry Carroll won a first ever assembly seat for the People Before Profit Alliance, topping the poll in West Belfast for the left-wing party to take one of the five seats Sinn Féin had held in the constituency.The SDLP's Alex Attwood retained his West Belfast seat by a narrow margin, overcoming DUP challenger Frank McCoubrey by just 89 votes.Mr Carroll said his success was evidence that voters had become ""fed-up with the status quo"" and were ""looking for a political alternative"".He was joined by his party colleague and veteran civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann, who was elected in Foyle, taking a seat from the SDLP.Martin McGuinness topped the poll for Sinn Féin in his home constituency of Foyle, and was elected along with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat when he was eliminated after the first count, but he said his his nine years as an MLA had been a ""privilege"".He was twice elected as an Ulster Unionist but left the party in 2013 to form the ill-fated NI21, which imploded just over a year later.Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said he was ""stunned"" to top the Strangford poll, but acknowledged that he had been ""ambitious"" with his prediction of the number of seats his party would win.Alliance Party leader David Ford crossed the line in South Antrim and Jim Allister, who leads the Traditional Unionist Voice, was re-elected in North Antrim.Former MP Naomi Long will return to frontline politics after her election for the Alliance Party in East Belfast, where she lost her Westminster seat to the DUP last year.The DUP's Joanne Bunting has taken the East Belfast seat vacated by former first minister Peter Robinson, who retired earlier this year.In South Belfast, the city's former lord mayor Máirtín Ó Muilleoir was elected after topping the poll and Claire Bailey gained a seat in the constituency for the Green Party, saying she wanted to ""change the conversation at Stormont"".The DUP also made a gain in the constituency, with councillor Christopher Stalford taking the seat that had been held by the UUP.Jenny Palmer, a councillor who left the DUP last year after claiming she had been bullied, took a seat off her former party when she was elected for the Ulster Unionists in Lagan Valley.Former agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew, who left the assembly to serve as an MP, will return to Stormont after her election for Sinn Féin in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.William Irwin of the DUP came top of the poll Newry and Armagh, while former Armagh gaelic footballer Justin McNulty will be another new face in the assembly for the SDLP after securing his party's single seat in the constituency.Three Sinn Féin candidates came through in Mid Ulster, but the DUP's McCrea dynasty came to an end when Ian, the son of former MP and MLA William, lost his seat to party colleague Keith Buchanan.Former health minister Jim Wells, who has endured a series of controversies in the past two years, was re-elected in South Down.He made a formal complaint to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland after his wife and the husband of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) candidate Sinéad Bradley were denied entry to the count.The leaders of the two largest parties in Northern Ireland will be delighted by the results so far.The DUP is on course to hold the seats it took in 2011 and Sinn Féin are hopeful they will better their 2011 election when they won 29 seats.In contrast, it has been a disappointing day for the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood.Two hundred and seventy-six candidates have been competing across Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies.In all, 703,744 people voted in the election, representing a turnout of 54.91%, which was down slightly from the figure of 55.64% in the 2011 assembly election.In general terms, turnout in eastern constituencies has increased compared to 2011, but dropped in western constituencies.More than 2,000 staff are involved in counting the votes in eight centres across Northern Ireland.In Northern Ireland, MLAs are elected using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, a form of proportional representation.Seven counts will resume on Saturday morning, with the final seats not due to be declared later in the day."
2016-05-10,Police probe Tory election expenses,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36231138,"Eight police forces are investigating whether Conservative MPs filed election expenses illegally after the 2015 General Election, the BBC understands.The allegations centre around failing to register the accommodation costs of party activists who were involved in the ""battle bus"" operation. The party has blamed an ""administrative error"".A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.The activists on the party's battle bus targeted marginal seats. The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.Failing to file correct expenses is a criminal offence.The eight forces actively investigating are West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, Greater Manchester Police, Devon and Cornwall Police, Gloucestershire Police, Northamptonshire Police, Staffordshire Police, and Cheshire Police.A further four forces are waiting for further information, the BBC understands.Police can investigate such claims up to a year after the election expenses were filed, and West Yorkshire Police, Derbyshire Police, and Greater Manchester Police have started the process of getting extensions to the time limit.A Conservative spokesperson said: ""As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus. ""However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return.  ""The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. ""Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning.""The Electoral Commission - which is an independent body that sets standards for running elections - is also investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act during the general election.The Commission has powers in relation to national campaign spending, although its sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance at the Electoral Commission, said: ""The police and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. ""We have requested that they consider doing this."" "

We didn't.""We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places.""He congratulated the ""hard work"" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: ""There is a lot of building to do in Scotland. ""We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again.""They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a ""weak leader"" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as ""shocking"". The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.""We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats,"" Tim Roache, its general secretary said. ""Let's give it a go. Let's give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen? Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day. Who knows.""But Mr McDonnell told critics to ""get behind the leader of the Labour Party that was democratically elected"".He added: ""I think most Labour Party members are saying 'look, you're damaging our campaign by the continuous carping'.""I've never been in a situation where, two days before a poll, a group of them are talking to the media about a leadership coup - and yet we still do well.""Former Labour minister Lord Falconer urged the party to focus ""outwards"" following a row over anti-Semitism involving the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.""There's real issues that need to be dealt with, but this idea of a divided party makes the Labour party despair and the public despair,"" he added."

2016-05-10,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Ahead of the referendum David Cameron secured an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depends on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU is headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including prime minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ,most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who is running the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. The group's biggest funder so far is supermarket magnate Lord Sainsbury.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  Read a Who's Who guide. The SNP is running its own remain campaign in Scotland as it does not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain. It has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs,  including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen are also involved. It has a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave so far. Read a Who's Who guide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party will be running its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Michael, from Royal Leamington Spa, is still sitting on the fence (he is not alone if the polls are to be believed). He wants to know when the official Leave and Remain campaigns get under way. Both sides in the debate are already making their arguments, which are unlikely to change much between now and polling day. But the official campaign period is from 15 April to 23 June. The Electoral Commission will designate official campaigns to represent either side of the argument, which will be entitled to TV broadcasts and help with campaigning costs. The Commission must decide by 14 April.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.What is the single market? Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part.John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US."
2016-05-10,The Sadiq Khan story,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36140479,"Labour's Sadiq Khan has been elected as London's new mayor - but who is the man who will be in charge of the UK's capital city for the next four years?Sadiq Khan's life to date has been characterised by beating the odds - which is what he has just done to become mayor of London.When Labour politicians put themselves forward to run for mayor last year, Mr Khan was far from being the favourite. The bookies' money was on Baroness Jowell, a veteran of the Tony Blair years who had helped bring the Olympics to London. But if there is a pattern in Mr Khan's career, it's one of coming from behind. The new mayor did not have a privileged start in life. He was one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants, a bus driver and a seamstress, on a south London housing estate. From an early age, he showed a firm resolve to defy the odds in order to win success for himself and the causes important to him.That resolve has won him the biggest personal mandate in the UK, a job with wide-ranging powers over London and with enormous emotional significance for him. Some question whether he has the experience or record of good judgement necessary for the role. He insists he is there to represent all Londoners and to tackle inequality in the capital, and now he has the chance to prove it. Age: 45Marital status: Married with two daughtersPolitical party: LabourTime as MP: Has represented Tooting in south London since 2005Previous jobs: Human rights solicitor, chair of Liberty""Son of a bus driver"" became one of the most hackneyed phrases in Mr Khan's time on the stump - so overused in his leaflets and speeches that he was eventually forced to make fun of his own campaign, joking he had given the Daily Mirror an ""exclusive"" on his background. But his parents' story holds real significance for him. Amanullah and Sehrun Khan emigrated from Pakistan to London shortly before Sadiq was born, in 1970. He was the fifth of their eight children - seven sons and a daughter. He has often said that his early impressions of the world of work shaped his belief in the trade union movement. His father, a bus driver for 25 years, ""was in a union and got decent pay and conditions"" whereas his mum, a stay-at-home seamstress, ""wasn't, and didn't"".He lived with his parents and siblings in a cramped three-bedroomed house on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield, south-west London, sharing a bunkbed with one of his brothers until he left home in his 20s. He attended the local comprehensive, Ernest Bevin College, which he describes as ""a tough school - it wasn't always a bed of roses"". The nickname ""Bevin boys"" was at that time in that part of south London a byword for bad behaviour.It was at school that he first began to gravitate towards politics, joining the Labour Party aged 15. He credits the school's head, Naz Bokhari, who happened to be the first Muslim headteacher at a UK secondary school, with making him realise ""skin colour or background wasn't a barrier to making something with your life"".Mr Khan was raised a Muslim and has never shied away from acknowledging the importance of his faith. In his maiden speech as an MP he spoke about his father teaching him Mohammed's sayings, or hadiths - in particular the principle that ""if one sees something wrong, one has the duty to try to change it"".He was an able student who loved football, boxing and cricket - he even had a trial for Surrey County Cricket Club as a teenager. He has since spoken about the racist abuse he and his brothers faced at Wimbledon and Chelsea football matches, saying he felt ""safer"" watching at home and became a Liverpool fan simply ""because they were playing such great football at the time"".He studied maths and science at A-level with the idea of becoming a dentist. He was switched on to law by a teacher who told him ""you're always arguing"" - and by the TV programme LA Law, starring Jimmy Smits as Victor Sifuentes, a charismatic partner in a California law firm.""LA law was about lawyers in LA who do great cases, act for the underdog, drove nice cars, look great and I wanted to be Sifuentes,"" Mr Khan told Business Insider recently.He studied law at the University of North London and put his degree to good use straight away, becoming a trainee solicitor in 1994 at Christian Fisher under the human rights lawyer Louise Christian. The same year he met and married his wife Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor and coincidentally the daughter of a bus driver - with whom he went on to have two daughters, Anisah and Ammarah. He also began his 12-year stint as a councillor for Tooting, encouraged by Guyanan-born local activist Bert Luthers.Just three years later, aged 27, he was made an equity partner and the firm was renamed Christian Khan.During this time he worked on a number of high-profile cases: he won compensation for Kenneth Hsu, a hairdresser wrongly arrested and assaulted by the police; teachers and lawyers who had experienced racial discrimination; Leroy Logan, a senior black police officer accused of fraud; corrupt former Met Police commander Ali Dizaei; and helped overturn an exclusion order (later upheld on appeal) on US political activist Louis Farrakhan.The irony of a man who represented people in cases against the Met going on to become the force's chief scrutineer has not been lost on his opponents. Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith, speaking at an event alongside Home Secretary Theresa May, recently characterised Mr Khan's legal career as ""coaching people in suing our police"".He left his law firm somewhat abruptly in 2004, afterwards telling the Law Gazette: ""If you're in government, you're a legislator and you have the opportunity to make laws that can improve things for millions of people.""In 2005, Mr Khan fought and retained the marginal seat of Tooting for Labour, one of five new ethnic minority MPs elected that year.Contemporaries on either side of the political divide remember being impressed by a ""fiercely bright"" and ""persuasive"" individual who was ""impossible not to listen to"". He combines that sharpness with what is often called his ""cheeky chappy"" demeanour. He is fond of calling people ""mate"" and has even done so on the floor of the Commons.Two months after he entered the Commons, he was thrust into the limelight by the 7 July bombings. When Parliament met to discuss the attacks, he told MPs: ""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted on Thursday; proud of the way ordinary courageous Londoners carried on with their business and stopped the criminals disrupting our life.""In a 2010 Guardian interview, he recalled thinking: ""I couldn't hide - and I don't mean this in an arrogant way, but there were so few articulate voices of reason from the British Muslim community. ""There were angry men with beards, but nobody saying, 'Actually, I'm very comfortable being a Brit, being a Muslim, being a Londoner'."" The intervention marked him out as one to watch, but his path to promotion was not altogether smooth. Mr Khan wore his civil liberties credentials on his sleeve, challenging the government over ID cards and joining 48 other Labour rebels to vote against prime minister Tony Blair's plan to allow the detention of terror suspects without charge for up to 90 days. He later claimed party chiefs had penalised him by preventing him from visiting Pakistan in the wake of an earthquake there and did not want to give him an office with a sofa.But the rebellion was not altogether to his disadvantage. Tony Blair was on his way out, and Mr Khan was able to position himself on the ascendant ""soft left"" of the Labour party alongside Ed Balls and Gordon Brown. ""It was a tough school; it wasn't always a bed of roses. But you become street wise, you become savvy and you learn social skills - you learn about how to deal with people."" - on his schooldays""The way allegations of misconduct against police officers are investigated is flawed and inadequate."" - as a human rights solicitor""Although I'd won cases at the European Court of Human Rights, and I'd won cases in the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal, I still couldn't escape the fact that if you're part of the legislature and the executive, you can make legislation that improves the quality of life for literally millions of people."" - on leaving law to become an MP""Today Londoners and the rest of the UK have even more reason to be proud of Londoners - proud of the way heroic Londoners of all faiths, races and backgrounds, victims, survivors and passers-by, acted."" - on the 7/7 attacks""Most people feel nagged by their parents from time to time, but very rarely is it about the future of bus regulation."" - on his father ""I sleep in my own bed. When I get home I put the rubbish out and get my girls up to go to school."" - on staying grounded""For the last eight years you've seen a red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hand. I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners."" - on launching his mayoral bidWhen Gordon Brown took over at Number 10, Mr Khan was given his first job in government as a whip and then as communities minister, a move that created disquiet among some other MPs in the capital who had been around for longer.A post at the Department for Transport followed in 2009 and he became the first Muslim in the Cabinet. This was at a time when there were only four Muslim MPs and he was often confused for international development minister Shahid Malik.He would go on to claim during the mayoral campaign that as transport minister he had ""pushed"" Crossrail through Parliament, but the Mayorwatch website has shown Mr Khan only took on responsibility for the project after the relevant bill had become law. At the 2010 election, Mr Khan's own majority was squeezed to an uncomfortably small margin of just 2,524 votes and Labour was out of government for the first time in 13 years.In the chaotic months of Labour soul-searching that followed, he again showed a canny ability to ally himself with what was seemingly a lost cause and turn it into success.True to his Brownite colours, he was chosen as Ed Miliband's campaign manager and helped steer the less-favoured Miliband brother towards an unexpected leadership election victory.He told the New Statesman afterwards that the night before the result, he told Miliband to ""prepare for defeat"". ""I learned this from (television series) Rumpole of the Bailey,"" he said. ""Always tell your client he's going to lose because, if he loses, he's expecting it; if he wins, you're the fantastic lawyer who got the victory."" However, he added: ""I had a feeling we'd done it.""In that contest, as in the Labour mayoral nomination, Mr Khan's support for the trade union movement helped his campaign secure crucial votes.He was rewarded with the post of shadow justice secretary - a role in which he did not get off to an auspicious start. His first major speech was badly received when he chose to highlight Labour's failings in government, and in then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke he faced an adversary with whom he admitted he struggled to find things to disagree about.His other brief as shadow political reform minister did not provide much of a chance to shine either, as the coalition needed little help killing off its own proposals for Lords reform and his personal support for changes to the voting system was tempered by his view that the referendum on this - which saw the British public reject change - came at the wrong time.When Mr Clarke was sacked and replaced with Chris Grayling, however, Mr Khan was able to take the fight to the despatch box more convincingly as a vocal opponent of reforms to legal aid and restrictions on books in prisons.When the Conservatives later reversed several of Mr Grayling's flagship policies he described it as a ""huge climbdown"" that showed Labour had been right to resist them.Labour's disastrous showing in the 2015 election and the swift resignation of Ed Miliband - the man he had helped to the leadership - could have thrown Mr Khan off-course, but he found a new focus for his campaigning energy.Just a week after the election he announced he would seek the Labour nomination for mayor. He had already been tipped as a possible contender at least a year but, with typical shrewdness, he had steadfastly refused to be drawn on the subject in public while sounding out MPs and councillors in private to see if he had enough support.Once he had confirmed his mayoral ambitions, his quest for the nomination - let alone an election win - still seemed like a long shot. Baroness Jowell, who had been MP for Dulwich and West Norwood for 23 years and held a number of senior ministerial positions under Labour, was widely seen as the natural choice.That received wisdom was upended during the Labour leadership contest, when commentators predicted the influx of new members into the party over the summer of ""Corbynmania"" could play into Mr Khan's hands. He would take some flak over his role in Jeremy Corbyn's election as party leader, as he nominated him but later voted for Andy Burnham. In the event, however, Mr Khan came out top as Labour choice of candidate not just with new members but in all three groups who could vote. It was a remarkable victory which, as the BBC's Norman Smith observed on the day, surprised him as much as it did his rivals.The campaign that ensued was bloody. A former aide to long-time Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, Ayesha Hazarika, reflected that when Zac Goldsmith - who had a reputation for being decent, attractive and independent-minded - was first picked as the Conservative candidate there was despondency in Labour ranks.Mr Khan said himself at one hustings that he thought his opponent had been a ""nice guy until [Conservative strategist] Sir Lynton Crosby got his hands on him"". Whoever came up with the approach, Mr Goldsmith's campaign focused heavily on portraying Mr Khan as an associate of ""extremists"" - which in turn allowed Labour to attack the Conservatives for pursuing ""divisive, dog-whistle"" tactics. Mr Khan took this to be an attempt to smear him by association because of his religion. The Conservatives insisted they were talking about his brand of left-wing politics - but Mr Goldsmith repeatedly said the Labour candidate had ""given platform, oxygen and cover to extremists"".It became a source of such bitter tension between the two camps that when David Cameron stuck up for Mr Goldsmith's campaign at prime minister's questions he found the word ""racist"" flung back at him from the Labour benches.While polls consistently suggested Mr Khan was ahead, Labour pessimists and Conservative optimists would remind themselves that Mr Goldsmith was likely to benefit from a Tory incumbency, from lower turnout among groups that tended to vote Labour, and from the under-reporting of Conservative support seen at the 2015 general election.But those things were not enough - or proved not to be the case at all. Voter turnout was 45%, an increase of 7% on 2012, and it was clear quite early on in the day that Mr Khan had a healthy lead over his Conservative rival.Another London Labour MP born to immigrant parents, David Lammy, told the BBC Mr Khan's election was a ""huge moment"" and predicted: ""If we ever see a black or Asian prime minister in this country I have no doubt they will owe an enormous debt to Sadiq Khan.""Now, the boy from Tooting will have to prove himself all over again. Love them or loathe them, the mayor's predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone - the only other men to have done the job - are political heavyweights. Even within his own party, Mr Khan has been accused of lacking vision. The perception of him as inexperienced also lingers on.One close Labour ally pointed out that ""unlike Ken, he has held ministerial office - but more than that, he represents the future. Unlike Boris he'll be wholly focused on getting results for London - this isn't just a stepping stone for his career"".She predicted he would be anxious to make good on the ambitious promises he made during the campaign, particularly on addressing London's housing problems.If that were not enough to be getting on with, he faces a dilemma over how to navigate between co-operating with the Conservative government and teaming up with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in condemnation of the Tories.In this respect he may hope to repeat the tactics of Boris Johnson, who managed to pull off alternately angering and assisting the government. If he is to succeed he will need to display the same knack for steering his own course as he has shown as a schoolboy, a campaigning lawyer, a backbench MP and a shadow minister.But those who voted for him will not forget his emphasis on his own disadvantaged background, his speeches about social justice and his promise to be a ""mayor for all Londoners""."
2016-05-10,Independence loss,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36227731,"It never feels good for any politician to wake up the morning after an election defeat. Today it's hard to imagine many senior Labour figures got much sleep at all last night. No doubt lying awake contemplating their humiliating defeat by the Tories who knocked them decisively into third place. But also having to ask deeper existential questions about whether there is still a place for the Labour party in the Scottish political landscape.Labour can spend the next few days and weeks asking if it was their polices that voters didn't like. Was it a mistake to offer to raise income tax for almost every taxpayer in Scotland? Was it their young and inexperienced leader who has only been in the job nine short months? Was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership a factor?But arguments over their manifesto or personalities are to miss the point. This election was clearly about the constitution. Scottish politics are still totally dominated by the independence question which was certainly not settled on 18 September 2014 and still seems to take precedence in voters' minds over any other issue. And it's an issue on which Labour cannot win.""We have to get our story straight on where we stand on independence"", is what very depressed Labour figures were telling me on Thursday night. But they had different ideas about what that story should be.Labour can never form another government in Holyrood or win back many of their Westminster seats unless they appeal to former Labour voters who have now decided they favour an independent Scotland and are currently voting SNP. But what we learned last night was that if Labour don't take a hard line on their support for the union they haemorrhage votes to the Tories. Labour tried to reach out to Yes voters by saying that if there was another referendum Labour politicians would be free to campaign on either side. Kezia Dugdale even suggested in one interview that she might consider voting for independence in the event of a Brexit but then tried to row back from that - whilst also saying that she resolutely opposed the idea of having another referendum and would vigorously campaign for a no vote if there was to be another indyref.That left space for the Tories to proclaim themselves the only true party of the Union. They accused Labour of being soft on independence and it seems to have worked. The roughly 10% of voters the Tories seem to have grabbed from Labour are largely unionists who wanted to express their opposition to independence at the ballot box once more. So where does that leave Labour? If the SNP are the party of independence and the Tories the party of the union, what is the point of the Labour Party? They will continue to argue that they care most about social justice and poverty. But as long as voters remain split over the constitution that may not win back many voters.   One small consolation for Scottish labour leader Kezia Dugdale - it seems unlikely she will face a leadership challenge even despite this terrible result. Why? Partly because Labour have finally realised changing leaders every time they lose an election hasn't helped. But mostly because no-one wants the job of Scottish labour leader right now. And who can blame them?"
2016-05-10,Political maps,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36215186,"What impact have the elections had on the political maps of London, Scotland, Wales and England?In London, Labour's Sadiq Khan defeated Conservative Zac Goldsmith to become mayor. Khan came out on top in three constituencies that had voted for former mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012. After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%.The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.Of the 14 London Assembly seats, Labour won nine, taking Merton and Wandsworth from the Conservatives, who held five boroughs.The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six, and the Lib Dems five.  Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour. But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP. The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies. The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament. That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.  Labour is likely to hang on to power in Wales, with just one constituency changing hands, as Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party. The biggest shift in Welsh politics overnight is the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats. 
            	Your browser does not support this interactive content
        	Although UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third. In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent. Voters in some parts in England have also been choosing their local councillors. A total of 124 councils are up for re-election, in part or in whole. After 115 results had been announced, Labour had lost 24 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, which is now under no overall control. The Conservatives had lost a total of 33 council seats, having been up on their previous total earlier, but have not lost control of any of the 28 councils up for re-election. The Lib Dems had gained 35 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control. UKIP had 26 more council seats - but had not been able to convert these gains into control of any council. At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.

        	In general, turnout was significantly lower in Wales, but it was highest at 56.8% in Cardiff North where Labour won with about 45% of the vote and Brecon and Radnorshire where the Lib Dems took more than half of the vote. The biggest increase in turnout in Wales was in the Rhondda, the only constituency seat that changed hands.

2016-05-10,Corbyn's future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-36223968,"They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable.But the results were messier than they predicted.So when Jo Cox - the Batley MP who nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership to broaden the party's debate - says that Labour should have performed better at these elections, she has logic and precedence on her side. The party fared less well than the last time many of these seats were contested, in 2012, and Labour still went on to lose the subsequent general election.But it's not clear that the results provide enough ammunition for those who want to take aim at the leadership. Mr Corbyn's supporters will point out the party didn't hold on just in its northern heartlands, but in areas where it expected to lose - right down on the south coast, in Southampton and Hastings.His internal critics have been pointing out privately all night that beneath the surface, some of the results aren't anything to write home about. Labour retained overall control in Nuneaton for example, but lost ground to the Conservatives.  Crucially, though, the party's deputy leader Tom Watson made it clear he wasn't sanctioning any coup attempt with Mr Corbyn, who has been in the job for only eight months. He didn't think either winning - or losing - 100 seats should prove decisive, and he will have in mind that members and supporters who elected the Labour leader last September are unlikely to have been appalled at results which saw Labour retain control of Crawley. Since the 2014 referendum, Scotland tends to be viewed through a different prism. Unlike in England, Labour has to compete against another party describing itself as social-democratic: the SNP.But elsewhere in the UK, some Labour MPs, if not the new supporters of the party, will ask if there are lessons to be learnt from campaigning unsuccessfully on a platform of higher taxes for better public services.But a better guide to Labour's current weakness might be the Conservatives' strength.A governing party tearing itself apart from the grassroots to the cabinet table over Britain's relationship with the EU certainly looks like it will suffer some setbacks, notably in London.But it is on course for ending up with an increased tally of councillors - and very possibly becoming the official opposition in Scotland after years in the political wilderness.

2016-05-10,Team Khan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160508033057/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-london-36226252,"If many Londoners knew little about Sadiq Khan until this contest, it is likely they will know even less about the team that will help him govern at City Hall if he wins.Every mayor has the right to appoint two political advisers and up to 10 other staff, giving them a chance to surround themselves with trusted lieutenants and a chance to hit the ground running.So who might form Sadiq Khan's team to help him carry through on his campaign promises?It's likely the man who ran his campaign, David Bellamy, will continue as Khan's right-hand man as his chief of staff.And helping to deliver on the big issue of the election - housing - it's likely Mr Khan will stick with James Murray, an Islington councillor who advised the campaign on housing and stood in at debates for Mr Khan.There may also be a return to City Hall for Neale Coleman, an advisor to both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. Heavily involved in delivery the Olympics and its legacy, he briefly worked as head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn.Seen as capable and pragmatic, he's likely to have a role in settling Team Khan into the eight-floor offices. Another name being touted is that of Andrew Adonis - a former cabinet minister and currently the head of the National Infrastructure Commission.With big projects like Crossrail 2 and HS2 coming down the track, his expertise could prove key, but it may require him to walk away from the national job.If he's looking for a deputy mayor for policing, the smart money seems to be on current Assembly member Joanne McCartney, a trained barrister and Labour member for Enfield and Haringey, who has chaired the assembly's Police and Crime Committee.Fiona Twycross, who has worked on the Fire Authority, may also be rewarded.Former Bethnal Green MP Oona King, who backed Mr Khan when he first announced he was running, may enter City Hall in a communities role.Expect roles too for policy director Nick Bowes - widely seen as the ideas person behind the new mayor's campaign - and Leah Kreitzman and Jack Stenner, who have been key members of team Khan since he became Labour's candidate.Ex-journalist Patrick Hennessy, who ran communications for Mr Khan during the election campaign, is likely to continue selling the message."

That ""suggests that the statement in the government leaflet is not significantly affected by it"".It may seem odd that the impact is so small, given that the Netherlands is the third biggest customer for UK exports, behind the USA and Germany. But remember that the Rotterdam Effect only affects exports of goods, while the 44% figure is for both goods and services.Sir Andrew did suggest that a more prominent note in the statistics about the Rotterdam Effect would be helpful. In evidence to the parliamentary committee chaired by  Bernard Jenkin, he said that would be particularly important to people interested in the level of exports to the Netherlands rather than the whole EU.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"

That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added.

The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project. How do we fight it best, within or without?""On balance, I think we fight it better within and we make alliances with other European left movements. But it's a dangerous, dangerous moment."" "

""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."
2016-05-11,Labour EU rivals debate women's rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36280541,"Campaigners fighting for women's votes in the EU referendum have clashed over whether it protects their rights.Harriet Harman, Labour former deputy leader, said EU membership meant there was a ""floor that is guaranteed"" on equal pay and maternity leave.But Labour MP Gisela Stuart, of Vote Leave, said the UK had gone further on those rights than the EU once they had been established. Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

Don't let somebody else make it for you.""He said it would be ""young people who will make the difference"" and urged them to embrace the idea of people working together across Europe to tackle climate change, inequality and to ""hold global corporations to account""This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Later, in a speech at Oxford University, former Conservative PM John Major will suggest some of his party colleagues who are campaigning for the UK to leave the EU risk ""morphing into UKIP"" by turning ""to their default position - immigration"". ""This is their trump card. I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think.... I suspect he would be fired if he didn't take the government's side."""

2016-05-11,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-11,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-11,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"

Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-11,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-11,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject.

It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-11,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-12,Cameron pledges to help children in care,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36295213,"The government is to pass new laws to encourage adoption, as part of plans to improve the chances of children in social care, David Cameron has said.Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care.New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when it overrides family ties, he added.Labour said government cuts had already harmed students and working families.The government will outline the plans in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday.The speech - which will mark the official state opening of Parliament - will reveal the laws the government hopes to get approved over the coming year.It is expected to include measures aimed at encouraging top UK universities to do more to improve social mobility and more help with energy costs for poorer households.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron was ""keen to demonstrate that his current focus on the EU referendum was not at the expense of the domestic political agenda"".In January, Mr Cameron promised an ""all-out assault on poverty"" with a series of social reforms to include better mental health services and mentoring schemes.Writing ahead of the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said the government will legislate to encourage permanent adoption - even if it means children are not placed with relatives.He said he was ""unashamedly pro-adoption"" and criticised courts and social workers for favouring ""less stable placements"" with distant relatives rather than with adoption families.""We will legislate to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child - even when that means overriding family ties"", he said.""For too long, whether through misguided notions of what is right or sensitivities about not wanting to cause offence, we have let the most vulnerable in our country down. That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

2016-05-12,Lords reform 'puts its future at risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36294740,"The future of the House of Lords would be called into question if ministers press ahead with plans to curtail its powers, the Lord Speaker has said.Baroness D'Souza said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account"".A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers. But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added. Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST."
2016-05-12,EU referendum campaigns hit the streets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037,"The EU referendum campaign is moving up a gear this weekend as campaigners from both sides of the debate take to the streets to try to win over voters.PM David Cameron warned that leaving the EU would have a ""devastating impact"" on infrastructure projects.Billions in funding would be lost, he said in a speech in his constituency.Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, in Bristol, said the UK should leave because the EU has changed ""out of all recognition from what we signed up for"".Grassroots Out, which is also calling for the UK to leave the EU, is holding a series of nationwide events on Saturday, while the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said it was putting on about 1,000 events across the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged his supporters at a rally in London to vote Remain, saying it was ""not the European Union that's the problem - it's the Conservative government"". The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project. How do we fight it best, within or without?""On balance, I think we fight it better within and we make alliances with other European left movements. But it's a dangerous, dangerous moment."" "
2016-05-12,All voters to get EU referendum guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286993,"An impartial voting guide for the EU referendum will drop through the letterboxes of 28 million households across the UK from 16 May.The eight-page booklet gives advice on who can vote, how to register and a page on each of the lead campaigns.It is part of a £6.4m awareness campaign organised by the Electoral Commission, which includes a TV advert. People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.'Consider a proxy'The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.It comes a month after the government spent £9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site. Electoral Commission advertising will run until polling day and appear across TV, radio, video on demand services, billboards, digital and social media.Bilingual versions of the booklet - which cost £2.4m to produce and deliver - will be delivered to households in Wales.Nearly 140,000 people registered to vote in the final through weeks before the Scottish referendum in September 2014.

The by-election will be held on 16 June.Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a ""passionate local, a community activist and health advocate"".She adds: ""As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election. Winning 1,310,143 votes in the London mayoral election, he received the largest personal mandate of any politician in UK history."
2016-05-12,Call for Tory election letters probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36284335,"Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded police take action.He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.One concluded: ""The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay.""The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: ""It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency. ""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."
2016-05-12,Labour EU rivals debate women's rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36280541,"Campaigners fighting for women's votes in the EU referendum have clashed over whether it protects their rights.Harriet Harman, Labour former deputy leader, said EU membership meant there was a ""floor that is guaranteed"" on equal pay and maternity leave.But Labour MP Gisela Stuart, of Vote Leave, said the UK had gone further on those rights than the EU once they had been established. Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

""This is their trump card. I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think....

2016-05-12,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-12,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-12,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"
2016-05-12,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286456,"The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-12,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-12,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject. It is the plat du jour.Except in Washington, Brexit is the snack they want to see removed from the menu."
2016-05-12,Overheard,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36260942,"David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-12,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.Lords chief whip - Lord Bassam of BrightonFormer leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.Shadow minister without portfolio - Jonathan Ashworth Labour shadow cabinet in fullThe Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband.

2016-05-13,Cameron pledges to help children in care,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36295213,"The government is to pass new laws to encourage adoption, as part of plans to improve the chances of children in social care, David Cameron has said.Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care.New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when it overrides family ties, he added.Labour said government cuts had already harmed students and working families.The government will outline the plans in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday.The speech - which will mark the official state opening of Parliament - will reveal the laws the government hopes to get approved over the coming year.It is expected to include measures aimed at encouraging top UK universities to do more to improve social mobility and more help with energy costs for poorer households.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron was ""keen to demonstrate that his current focus on the EU referendum was not at the expense of the domestic political agenda"".In January, Mr Cameron promised an ""all-out assault on poverty"" with a series of social reforms to include better mental health services and mentoring schemes.Writing ahead of the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said the government will legislate to encourage permanent adoption - even if it means children are not placed with relatives.He said he was ""unashamedly pro-adoption"" and criticised courts and social workers for favouring ""less stable placements"" with distant relatives rather than with adoption families.""We will legislate to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child - even when that means overriding family ties"", he said.""For too long, whether through misguided notions of what is right or sensitivities about not wanting to cause offence, we have let the most vulnerable in our country down. That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

2016-05-13,Lords reform 'puts its future at risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36294740,"The future of the House of Lords would be called into question if ministers press ahead with plans to curtail its powers, the Lord Speaker has said.Baroness D'Souza said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account"".A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers. But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added. Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST."
2016-05-13,EU referendum campaigns hit the streets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037,"The EU referendum campaign is moving up a gear this weekend as campaigners from both sides of the debate take to the streets to try to win over voters.PM David Cameron warned that leaving the EU would have a ""devastating impact"" on infrastructure projects.Billions in funding would be lost, he said in a speech in his constituency.Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, in Bristol, said the UK should leave because the EU has changed ""out of all recognition from what we signed up for"".Grassroots Out, which is also calling for the UK to leave the EU, is holding a series of nationwide events on Saturday, while the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said it was putting on about 1,000 events across the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged his supporters at a rally in London to vote Remain, saying it was ""not the European Union that's the problem - it's the Conservative government"". The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project. How do we fight it best, within or without?""On balance, I think we fight it better within and we make alliances with other European left movements. But it's a dangerous, dangerous moment."" "

People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.'Consider a proxy'The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.It comes a month after the government spent £9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site. Electoral Commission advertising will run until polling day and appear across TV, radio, video on demand services, billboards, digital and social media.Bilingual versions of the booklet - which cost £2.4m to produce and deliver - will be delivered to households in Wales.Nearly 140,000 people registered to vote in the final through weeks before the Scottish referendum in September 2014.

The by-election will be held on 16 June.Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a ""passionate local, a community activist and health advocate"".She adds: ""As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election. Winning 1,310,143 votes in the London mayoral election, he received the largest personal mandate of any politician in UK history."
2016-05-13,Call for Tory election letters probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36284335,"Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded police take action.He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.One concluded: ""The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay.""The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: ""It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency. ""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."
2016-05-13,Labour EU rivals debate women's rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36280541,"Campaigners fighting for women's votes in the EU referendum have clashed over whether it protects their rights.Harriet Harman, Labour former deputy leader, said EU membership meant there was a ""floor that is guaranteed"" on equal pay and maternity leave.But Labour MP Gisela Stuart, of Vote Leave, said the UK had gone further on those rights than the EU once they had been established. Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowThe Labour leader urged young voters to make sure they registered to vote in the referendum on 23 June: ""Take destiny in your own hands, register to vote and make your decision. Don't let somebody else make it for you.""He said it would be ""young people who will make the difference"" and urged them to embrace the idea of people working together across Europe to tackle climate change, inequality and to ""hold global corporations to account""This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Later, in a speech at Oxford University, former Conservative PM John Major will suggest some of his party colleagues who are campaigning for the UK to leave the EU risk ""morphing into UKIP"" by turning ""to their default position - immigration"". ""This is their trump card. I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think.... I suspect he would be fired if he didn't take the government's side."""

2016-05-13,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-13,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-13,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"
2016-05-13,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286456,"The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-13,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-13,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject. It is the plat du jour.Except in Washington, Brexit is the snack they want to see removed from the menu."
2016-05-13,Overheard,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36260942,"David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-13,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

2016-05-14,Cameron pledges to help children in care,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36295213,"The government is to pass new laws to encourage adoption, as part of plans to improve the chances of children in social care, David Cameron has said.Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care.New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when it overrides family ties, he added.Labour said government cuts had already harmed students and working families.The government will outline the plans in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday.The speech - which will mark the official state opening of Parliament - will reveal the laws the government hopes to get approved over the coming year.It is expected to include measures aimed at encouraging top UK universities to do more to improve social mobility and more help with energy costs for poorer households.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron was ""keen to demonstrate that his current focus on the EU referendum was not at the expense of the domestic political agenda"".In January, Mr Cameron promised an ""all-out assault on poverty"" with a series of social reforms to include better mental health services and mentoring schemes.Writing ahead of the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said the government will legislate to encourage permanent adoption - even if it means children are not placed with relatives.He said he was ""unashamedly pro-adoption"" and criticised courts and social workers for favouring ""less stable placements"" with distant relatives rather than with adoption families.""We will legislate to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child - even when that means overriding family ties"", he said.""For too long, whether through misguided notions of what is right or sensitivities about not wanting to cause offence, we have let the most vulnerable in our country down. That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

2016-05-14,Lords reform 'puts its future at risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36294740,"The future of the House of Lords would be called into question if ministers press ahead with plans to curtail its powers, the Lord Speaker has said.Baroness D'Souza said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account"".A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers. But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added. Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST."
2016-05-14,EU referendum campaigns hit the streets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037,"The EU referendum campaign is moving up a gear this weekend as campaigners from both sides of the debate take to the streets to try to win over voters.PM David Cameron warned that leaving the EU would have a ""devastating impact"" on infrastructure projects.Billions in funding would be lost, he said in a speech in his constituency.Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, in Bristol, said the UK should leave because the EU has changed ""out of all recognition from what we signed up for"".Grassroots Out, which is also calling for the UK to leave the EU, is holding a series of nationwide events on Saturday, while the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said it was putting on about 1,000 events across the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged his supporters at a rally in London to vote Remain, saying it was ""not the European Union that's the problem - it's the Conservative government"". The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project. How do we fight it best, within or without?""On balance, I think we fight it better within and we make alliances with other European left movements. But it's a dangerous, dangerous moment."" "

People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.'Consider a proxy'The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.It comes a month after the government spent £9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site. Electoral Commission advertising will run until polling day and appear across TV, radio, video on demand services, billboards, digital and social media.Bilingual versions of the booklet - which cost £2.4m to produce and deliver - will be delivered to households in Wales.Nearly 140,000 people registered to vote in the final through weeks before the Scottish referendum in September 2014.

The by-election will be held on 16 June.Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a ""passionate local, a community activist and health advocate"".She adds: ""As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election.

2016-05-14,Call for Tory election letters probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36284335,"Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded police take action.He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.One concluded: ""The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay.""The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: ""It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency. ""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."
2016-05-14,Labour EU rivals debate women's rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36280541,"Campaigners fighting for women's votes in the EU referendum have clashed over whether it protects their rights.Harriet Harman, Labour former deputy leader, said EU membership meant there was a ""floor that is guaranteed"" on equal pay and maternity leave.But Labour MP Gisela Stuart, of Vote Leave, said the UK had gone further on those rights than the EU once they had been established. Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think....

2016-05-14,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-14,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-14,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"
2016-05-14,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286456,"The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-14,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-14,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject. It is the plat du jour.Except in Washington, Brexit is the snack they want to see removed from the menu."
2016-05-14,Overheard,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36260942,"David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-14,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-15,Cameron pledges to help children in care,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36295213,"The government is to pass new laws to encourage adoption, as part of plans to improve the chances of children in social care, David Cameron has said.Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care.New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when it overrides family ties, he added.Labour said government cuts had already harmed students and working families.The government will outline the plans in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday.The speech - which will mark the official state opening of Parliament - will reveal the laws the government hopes to get approved over the coming year.It is expected to include measures aimed at encouraging top UK universities to do more to improve social mobility and more help with energy costs for poorer households.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron was ""keen to demonstrate that his current focus on the EU referendum was not at the expense of the domestic political agenda"".In January, Mr Cameron promised an ""all-out assault on poverty"" with a series of social reforms to include better mental health services and mentoring schemes.Writing ahead of the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said the government will legislate to encourage permanent adoption - even if it means children are not placed with relatives.He said he was ""unashamedly pro-adoption"" and criticised courts and social workers for favouring ""less stable placements"" with distant relatives rather than with adoption families.""We will legislate to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child - even when that means overriding family ties"", he said.""For too long, whether through misguided notions of what is right or sensitivities about not wanting to cause offence, we have let the most vulnerable in our country down. That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

2016-05-15,Lords reform 'puts its future at risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36294740,"The future of the House of Lords would be called into question if ministers press ahead with plans to curtail its powers, the Lord Speaker has said.Baroness D'Souza said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account"".A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers. But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added. Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST."
2016-05-15,EU referendum campaigns hit the streets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037,"The EU referendum campaign is moving up a gear this weekend as campaigners from both sides of the debate take to the streets to try to win over voters.PM David Cameron warned that leaving the EU would have a ""devastating impact"" on infrastructure projects.Billions in funding would be lost, he said in a speech in his constituency.Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, in Bristol, said the UK should leave because the EU has changed ""out of all recognition from what we signed up for"".Grassroots Out, which is also calling for the UK to leave the EU, is holding a series of nationwide events on Saturday, while the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said it was putting on about 1,000 events across the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged his supporters at a rally in London to vote Remain, saying it was ""not the European Union that's the problem - it's the Conservative government"". The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project.

People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.'Consider a proxy'The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.It comes a month after the government spent £9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site. Electoral Commission advertising will run until polling day and appear across TV, radio, video on demand services, billboards, digital and social media.Bilingual versions of the booklet - which cost £2.4m to produce and deliver - will be delivered to households in Wales.Nearly 140,000 people registered to vote in the final through weeks before the Scottish referendum in September 2014. Over 11,000 applied to register after the deadline - and missed out as a result.EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest"

The by-election will be held on 16 June.Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a ""passionate local, a community activist and health advocate"".She adds: ""As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election. Winning 1,310,143 votes in the London mayoral election, he received the largest personal mandate of any politician in UK history."
2016-05-15,Call for Tory election letters probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36284335,"Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded police take action.He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.One concluded: ""The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay.""The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: ""It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency. ""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."
2016-05-15,Labour EU rivals debate women's rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36280541,"Campaigners fighting for women's votes in the EU referendum have clashed over whether it protects their rights.Harriet Harman, Labour former deputy leader, said EU membership meant there was a ""floor that is guaranteed"" on equal pay and maternity leave.But Labour MP Gisela Stuart, of Vote Leave, said the UK had gone further on those rights than the EU once they had been established. Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think....

2016-05-15,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-15,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-15,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"
2016-05-15,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286456,"The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-15,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-15,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject. It is the plat du jour.Except in Washington, Brexit is the snack they want to see removed from the menu."
2016-05-15,Overheard,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36260942,"David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-15,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.Lords chief whip - Lord Bassam of BrightonFormer leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.Shadow minister without portfolio - Jonathan Ashworth Labour shadow cabinet in fullThe Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband.

That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

2016-05-16,Lords reform 'puts its future at risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36294740,"The future of the House of Lords would be called into question if ministers press ahead with plans to curtail its powers, the Lord Speaker has said.Baroness D'Souza said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account"".A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers. But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added. Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST."
2016-05-16,EU referendum campaigns hit the streets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037,"The EU referendum campaign is moving up a gear this weekend as campaigners from both sides of the debate take to the streets to try to win over voters.PM David Cameron warned that leaving the EU would have a ""devastating impact"" on infrastructure projects.Billions in funding would be lost, he said in a speech in his constituency.Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, in Bristol, said the UK should leave because the EU has changed ""out of all recognition from what we signed up for"".Grassroots Out, which is also calling for the UK to leave the EU, is holding a series of nationwide events on Saturday, while the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said it was putting on about 1,000 events across the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged his supporters at a rally in London to vote Remain, saying it was ""not the European Union that's the problem - it's the Conservative government"". The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project. How do we fight it best, within or without?""On balance, I think we fight it better within and we make alliances with other European left movements. But it's a dangerous, dangerous moment."" "

People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.'Consider a proxy'The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.It comes a month after the government spent £9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site. Electoral Commission advertising will run until polling day and appear across TV, radio, video on demand services, billboards, digital and social media.Bilingual versions of the booklet - which cost £2.4m to produce and deliver - will be delivered to households in Wales.Nearly 140,000 people registered to vote in the final through weeks before the Scottish referendum in September 2014.

The by-election will be held on 16 June.Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a ""passionate local, a community activist and health advocate"".She adds: ""As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election. Winning 1,310,143 votes in the London mayoral election, he received the largest personal mandate of any politician in UK history."
2016-05-16,Call for Tory election letters probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36284335,"Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded police take action.He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.One concluded: ""The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay.""The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: ""It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency. ""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."

Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think.... I suspect he would be fired if he didn't take the government's side."""

2016-05-16,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-16,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-16,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"
2016-05-16,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286456,"The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-16,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-16,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject. It is the plat du jour.Except in Washington, Brexit is the snack they want to see removed from the menu."
2016-05-16,Overheard,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36260942,"David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-16,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

2016-05-17,Cameron pledges to help children in care,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36295213,"The government is to pass new laws to encourage adoption, as part of plans to improve the chances of children in social care, David Cameron has said.Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care.New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when it overrides family ties, he added.Labour said government cuts had already harmed students and working families.The government will outline the plans in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday.The speech - which will mark the official state opening of Parliament - will reveal the laws the government hopes to get approved over the coming year.It is expected to include measures aimed at encouraging top UK universities to do more to improve social mobility and more help with energy costs for poorer households.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron was ""keen to demonstrate that his current focus on the EU referendum was not at the expense of the domestic political agenda"".In January, Mr Cameron promised an ""all-out assault on poverty"" with a series of social reforms to include better mental health services and mentoring schemes.Writing ahead of the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said the government will legislate to encourage permanent adoption - even if it means children are not placed with relatives.He said he was ""unashamedly pro-adoption"" and criticised courts and social workers for favouring ""less stable placements"" with distant relatives rather than with adoption families.""We will legislate to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child - even when that means overriding family ties"", he said.""For too long, whether through misguided notions of what is right or sensitivities about not wanting to cause offence, we have let the most vulnerable in our country down. That needs to change,"" he wrote.Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added.A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said.Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"".Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant.""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare.""Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor.The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain.""The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added."

He added: ""I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.""Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.""Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this.""He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.He spelt out that this meant ""everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect"".Progress backed heavily defeated Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in last year's Labour leadership contest. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a ""right-wing conservative"" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: ""They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.""I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really.""

2016-05-17,Lords reform 'puts its future at risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36294740,"The future of the House of Lords would be called into question if ministers press ahead with plans to curtail its powers, the Lord Speaker has said.Baroness D'Souza said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account"".A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers. But Baroness D'Souza said limiting it would ""question what it is there for"".During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week. In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review, conducted by Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to ""think again"".They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for.""She said the Lords ""should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear"".""There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed.""She added that she would also be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807. Baroness D'Souza said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added. Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST."
2016-05-17,EU referendum campaigns hit the streets,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36289037,"The EU referendum campaign is moving up a gear this weekend as campaigners from both sides of the debate take to the streets to try to win over voters.PM David Cameron warned that leaving the EU would have a ""devastating impact"" on infrastructure projects.Billions in funding would be lost, he said in a speech in his constituency.Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, in Bristol, said the UK should leave because the EU has changed ""out of all recognition from what we signed up for"".Grassroots Out, which is also calling for the UK to leave the EU, is holding a series of nationwide events on Saturday, while the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said it was putting on about 1,000 events across the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn encouraged his supporters at a rally in London to vote Remain, saying it was ""not the European Union that's the problem - it's the Conservative government"". The referendum takes place on 23 June, when voters in the UK will be asked whether they want the country to stay in or to leave the European Union. With less than six weeks to go until the vote, and with the polls putting Remain and Leave at roughly 50-50, both sides have all to play for. Campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron said: ""Vital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB [European Investment Bank]. ""Not only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding - but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it's unlikely we'd be able to find that money from alternative sources.""Mr Cameron said projects that had benefited from such funding included new trains for the East Coast Main Line, the M8 motorway extension between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the expansion of research and teaching facilities at Oxford University.The prime minister also unveiled a poster, which depicted an envelope on a doormat with wording saying an EU exit would cost the equivalent of ""£4,300 for every household"".The designated out campaign, Vote Leave, has accused Mr Cameron of ""failing to be honest"" with voters, saying the cost of staying in is ""£4,600"" per household, as membership costs ""£50m"" a day.""David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.In his speech, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""aborted"" negotiations with the EU showed it was ""going in completely the wrong direction"".""All our attempts at reform are hopeless unless we vote to leave,"" he added. ""To those who say we can't do it, we can't survive on our own, I say 'yes we can' because we are the fifth biggest economy in the world.""This chance will not come again. This is the moment when we all have one equal vote, when everyone in this country can speak truth to power. And that truth is that we are better, braver, stronger and greater than those on the Remain side are currently saying that we are."" At a rally in London, Mr Corbyn - regarded as his party's most Eurosceptic leader in a generation - attacked the Conservative government as he sought to rally support for a Remain vote on 23 June.The Labour leader - who has been encouraged by some in the party to take a more prominent role in the campaign - said: ""There is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.""That is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people's lives here in Britain - the Tories are doing the opposite.""The cross-party Grassroots Out group - which lost to Vote Leave in its bid for the official campaign designation - held a series of events including a rally in Chester addressed by former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP migration spokesman Steven Woolfe.Mr Paterson said a vote to leave on 23 June would be the ""safer choice"".  ""If we vote to remain, we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU super state, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green MP Caroline Lucas were among the politicians taking part in the pro-Remain events.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron ""seems to have more in common with them than with people in his own party"".Our correspondent said internal Tory divisions over the EU were ""becoming increasingly bitter"" and party unity would be ""a challenge, win or lose"" after the referendum.Meanwhile, left-wing filmmaker Ken Loach has become the latest figure from the arts to express a view on the referendum, saying: ""The EU, as it stands, is a neo-liberal project. How do we fight it best, within or without?""On balance, I think we fight it better within and we make alliances with other European left movements. But it's a dangerous, dangerous moment."" "

People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.'Consider a proxy'The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.It comes a month after the government spent £9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site. Electoral Commission advertising will run until polling day and appear across TV, radio, video on demand services, billboards, digital and social media.Bilingual versions of the booklet - which cost £2.4m to produce and deliver - will be delivered to households in Wales.Nearly 140,000 people registered to vote in the final through weeks before the Scottish referendum in September 2014.

The by-election will be held on 16 June.Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a ""passionate local, a community activist and health advocate"".She adds: ""As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election.

2016-05-17,Call for Tory election letters probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36284335,"Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded police take action.He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.One concluded: ""The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay.""The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: ""It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency. ""That has to be a local cost, not a national expense.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate. ""The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party. ""Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate.""Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.He said: ""The law says if you're convicted of  the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP.""But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return. The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning ""battle bus"". The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an ""administrative error"", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred ""with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election"".The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are ""generally reportable"" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific ""facts and context""."

I hope that - when the heat of the referendum is behind us - the proponents of such mischief making will be embarrassed and ashamed at how they have misused this issue,"" he said.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Sir John said he did not want to ""silence"" debate on immigration, as it was a ""legitimate"" issue - but he warned that ""care honesty and balance"" was needed to avoid ""raising fears or fuelling prejudice"".Pro-exit justice minister Mr Raab said people cared about the ""pressure"" immigration puts on wages and public service, adding: ""I think we're trying to handle a very serious issue responsibly.""He pointed to data published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed a ""massive under-estimate"" in the amount of EU immigration into the UK, and said: ""If Sir John Major or anyone else campaigning to stay in the EU wants to make the case that that's just the price we've got to pay then he can make that argument.""But let's have the debate on the substance, not name-calling.""Meanwhile, Conservative MP Peter Lilley, a former minister under Sir John, also said Vote Leave had got the tone right on immigration and suggested Sir John was ""inventing a straw man"".""He was saying there is misuse of the issue - and that certainly would be wrong - but he didn't give any examples of this misuse,"" Mr Lilley added.Conservative David Davis said it was ""grossly unfair"" to dismiss concerns about immigration as ""UKIP"".""Sir John is right to warn that debates on immigration must not slip into xenophobia. But there are also great dangers from ignoring the very real concerns of the voters, and dismissing them as divisive and prejudiced,"" he said."

Reports suggest women are more likely to be undecided on which way to vote. Reality Check: Does the EU guarantee women's rights?Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""I don't blame them for that, there's a lot of people shouting at each other and not doing facts.How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.""I think we owe it to women in this country to say: 'Look, this is how we see the EU's affected your life'.""Ms Harman said there was a ""phoney perception"" that hard-won rights for part time workers and on issues like maternity leave and pay would remain in place regardless of whether the UK was in the European Union or not.""If I thought that all men in politics on all sides agreed with these rights then I would say: Yeah, we don't need those European guarantees anymore. But actually so often with women it's been two steps forward, one step back,"" she told Women's Hour. ""I've seen actually not only Conservative governments push back against rights from Europe but also Labour governments too saying: Sorry we just can't afford to do this at this time and oh no, the European Court is making us.""""We've still got to be fighting our corner. I very strongly disagree with those women and men who say we are all equal now .. Would that were the case. Fat chance.""Later, in a speech in London, she added: ""Why should we trust the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan-Smith or Nigel Farage with our rights as women? Even if they say they'd guarantee not to go below the rights for women that the EU guarantees - I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. It's your rights which are at stake here - so nor should you.""But her Labour colleague Gisela Stuart, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign said there were no guarantees that the European Parliament, now dominated by right-wing governments, would not back-pedal on women's rights in future.""They too can issue directives which can actually cut things,"" she told the BBC.""There was a time under Jacques Delors when the European Commission was dominated by socialist governments and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom didn't give us the rights we wanted and the European Commission did.""Since then, when you look at it,  what has happened is that at every stage basic rights which the EU started, in the UK, they are higher. Statutory maternity pay is higher in the UK than the EU. The leave is longer here. So what you've got is a very good argument for voting Labour.""She added that 50% of young people in Greece left unemployed were being ""sacrificed in the interests of the Euro"": ""This notion that the European Union is this great paragon of social justice, think again.""And her fellow Vote Leave campaigner Suzanne Evans told the Guardian it was ""utterly laughable"" to suggest that ""we need a bunch of former communist men in the EU Commission to fight for women's rights""."

She echoed similar comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"".The IMF said in a report on the UK economy that a leave vote could have a ""negative and substantial effect"". It has previously said that such an outcome could lead to ""severe regional and global damage"".The Fund said a Brexit vote would result in a ""protracted period of heightened uncertainty"" and could result in a sharp rise in interest rates, cause volatility on financial markets and damage London's status as a global financial centre.Ms Lagarde said the IMF had a duty to assess the risks of Brexit. It has a mandate to oversee the international monetary and financial system.The Fund is expected to publish detailed estimates of the economic impact of a vote to leave the EU in the week before the 23 June referendum, the timing of which has been criticised by leave campaigners.It was not just a domestic issue but an international one as well, Ms Lagarde told a briefing at the Treasury attended by the Chancellor, George Osborne. EU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum campaign latest""I don't think that in the last six months I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked 'what will be the economic consequences of Brexit?"" she said.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Asked if the Treasury had had any input into the IMF's conclusions, Ms Lagarde responded: ""Heck no! If you are suggesting that, you don't know the IMF."" Priti Patel MP, who is backing the leave campaign, said the IMF was ""wrong then and they are wrong now. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people.""Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, said: ""This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful.  Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. ""There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.""Britain Stronger in Europe chairman Lord Rose said: ""This is yet another economic expert that agrees Britain is stronger in Europe, adding to the comments of the Bank of England.""Former Treasury minister Lord Myners, who backs staying in the EU, added: ""Every major independent economic institution, from the Bank of England to the IMF, has made it clear that leaving the EU would damage the UK economy. This is yet more evidence that leaving is a risk we cannot afford to take.""The Fund said it expected UK growth to fall below 2% for the full year in 2016 before returning to an average of 2.25% over the medium term.However, the IMF said that this ""broadly positive"" forecast was subject to notable risks, the biggest of which was the EU referendum, but also the low level of household savings, high levels of household debt, a wide current account deficit and concerns that productivity growth will not rise significantly.Concerns about a possible Brexit may have affected UK markets in recent months, according to the Fund.It pointed to a 40% decline in the number of commercial real estate transactions in the first three months of the year.Deciding whether to remain in the EU was a choice for voters to make, the IMF said, adding that ""their decisions will reflect both economic and non-economic factors""."

In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way.

""This is their trump card. I urge them to take care, this is dangerous territory that - if handled carelessly - can open up long-term divisions in our society,"" he will say.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told LBC Radio that the ""Remain"" campaign knew that ""the strongest hand that the Leave camp have got is that by leaving the EU, we get back control of our borders and we would be able to put in place an Australian-style points system.""But he said the official Vote Leave campaign, of which UKIP is not a part, ""don't think I should exist"" and were ""more concerned about Conservative Party politics"" than winning the referendum. Asked about Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's comments on Thursday that a vote to leave could hit the UK economy, Mr Farage dismissed ""all these forecasts of doom and gloom"" adding: ""Mr Carney is paid out of the public purse and is doing the government's bidding isn't he?""He added: ""The whole apparatus of government at every level is being mobilised to tell us what we should think....

2016-05-17,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-17,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36276175,"Claim: The European Union is so corrupt that the European Court of Auditors has not signed off its accounts for 20 years.Reality Check verdict: The Court of Auditors has signed the EU accounts every year since 2007, while pointing out that EU countries, once they receive the EU funds, misuse about 4.4% of the total budget.At Prime Minister's Questions, Shipley MP Philip Davies supported David Cameron's comments about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt and asked: ""Can he tell us where he has the European Union in his league table of corruption given they haven't had their accounts signed off for 20 years.""The EU's accounts are scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which checks whether they correctly reflect the spending of the EU budget.The latest report, published in 2015 for accounts in 2014, explicitly said that the auditors were ""signing off the accounts"" as they have done every year since 2007. The Court did point out that some of the funds - 4.4% of the total in 2014 - were not used in accordance with the EU rules. But it stressed that this ""is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste"", but money that: ""should not have been paid out because it was not used in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations"". The auditors said typical cases involved roads or airports that attracted insufficient traffic. It is important to stress that around 80% of the EU budget is managed by member states themselves, and not by EU institutions. The EU transfers funds to the national treasuries and then the countries themselves decide which projects to spend the money on. The auditors have called on EU countries to take more care in their spending.In 2014, the court found that €666m (£524m) from the EU fund that is given to countries to finance projects in underdeveloped areas, was ""poor value for money"".  Poland, for example, built three airports, in Lodz, Rzeszow and Lublin, which have received more than €100m of EU funding, but which have not attracted enough customers to keep them in business. In 2012, a mountain lift was constructed in the Sicilian village of Sutera, to improve access to a mountain monastery to attract tourism. The project reportedly received around €2m of EU regional development money. However, due to high operating costs, the lift has never been in use.There are UK-based examples too. In 2008, the Canolfan Cywain rural heritage centre opened in Gwynedd, Wales, after it received £900,000 from the EU structural development fund. It ran into financial difficulties in September 2011 and closed a year later.On 28 April 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called on the UK government to improve how it spends EU funds. The committee found that UK departments contribute ""additional complexity"" to the implementation of EU programmes, especially agricultural and rural development ones, which also drives up errors. The errors have cost the UK government ""at least £650m"" in penalties, to the European Commission, over the past decade.If the auditors do suspect corruption, they pass the cases to OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office. According to the latest figures provided by the Commission, fraud affects 0.2% of the EU's annual spending. The estimated cost of fraudulent irregularities was €248m in 2013. For comparison, the UK National Audit Office says fraud across UK government was equivalent to only 0.02% of total expenditure: it ranged from £27.5m to £72.9m, depending on the source, from a total expenditure of £306bn. OLAF says it completed 3,500 investigations, which led to the recovery of more than €1.1bn for the EU budget and a total of 900 years of prison sentences since 1999. A separate NAO report estimated that the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error rate was 1.9% and HMRC's was 4.4% on its spending on benefits and tax credits in 2013-14. The report does not say how much was due to fraud and how much was due to error. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-17,Women voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36278874,"How are voters in Labour's heartlands approaching the EU referendum? And why do more women than men say they are still undecided on how they will vote? For the latest stage of Newsnight's Referendum Road series, we went to Preston, a city that's aiming to be the third largest in north-west England and a model for the Northern Powerhouse.About 15% of Preston's population is of Asian background, and they were traditionally a vital part of the workforce at Beech's chocolate factory, established in 1920.  But they've been replaced by newer migrants, mainly Poles who've come to Britain under the EU's freedom of movement agreement and now sit beside the conveyor belt packing chocolates next to local British workers, many of whom have worked in the factory for decades.""I was 16 when I started,"" Denise Wareing told me. ""I could smell the chocolate. I thought 'I wouldn't mind working there'."" The past looms large here, not least because Beech's chocolates are still produced in the original factory, with much of the same machinery.  Many of their competitors have moved their plants to eastern Europe where labour is cheaper. But the past figures in another way too. Many of the workers hark back to a time when they believe Britain was a better place. Fairly or unfairly, they blame the EU for the change.In a recent poll, almost a quarter of semi-skilled and unskilled workers said they still did not know how they would vote in June. There's been little shift in the numbers who say they already know how they will vote, either to leave or stay, so the undecideds are a key group in the referendum.Some analysts predict that when pushed to a decision, more undecided voters say they will choose to remain than to leave. In the factory, many of the women I spoke to told me they were undecided - but when pressed, the majority said they thought they wanted to vote out. Life would be sweeter outside the EU, they believe.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?It is an unscientific poll of course, but their reasons are illuminating. For them, more than anything, this is about controlling Britain's borders and protecting an over-stretched NHS, which they blame on the flow of migrant workers to the UK. It is worth noting Preston hasn't experienced the major migrant inflow that some parts of the country have.""The NHS is stretched to the maximum… more people are coming in and it will be stretched even further, and I think the borders need to be controlled a bit more,"" said Gill Collum at Beech's. Tina Caulton talked of eight non-British people who arrived in the dentist as she awaited an appointment. She said she was paying for her treatment, while none of them were. ""They're getting it for free.""None wanted to appear racist and they sit happily beside their Polish colleagues. As Tracy Parkin put it: ""I like the Polish, the people, they are very nice people."" But many of the workers want to stop the flow. Denise Wareing, preparing Turkish delight to be enrobed in chocolate, worries if Turkey joins the EU, even more people will want to come to the UK. ""Enough's enough,"" she said. ""We have to draw a line somewhere.""Barbara Collins has just retired after 50 years of chocolate-making. She understands the benefits of a diverse workforce.  ""We rely on people from different nationalities. We couldn't get the orders out without them. But I'm concerned about how many we are letting in.""The pro-Remain camp flags up the benefits of being part of the EU. It is argued that 350,000 jobs in north-west England are linked to trade with the EU, 25,000 jobs have been created or protected by EU investment projects here in the last five years, and the region received £996m in European structural funds between 2007 and 2013.But there's a disconnect between those statistics and perceived reality. The factory workers would have been traditional Labour voters in the past - their parents and grandparents voted for the party almost without question.  But historical ties to parties have become more muted.  The official Labour Party stance is to campaign for a remain vote. That's falling on deaf ears in this factory.  Many of the mainly female workforce told me they've stopped voting because they don't trust the politicians.  And when you don't trust the political class, you're not going to listen to them when they tell you that the economy will tank if Britain leaves the EU. Or that Britain's security will be under threat.This isn't a picture of general opinion in Preston, but a snapshot of a voter group who feel disenfranchised and left behind in the globalised world.  And it's difficult to imagine any arguments in favour of the EU ever being a sweet choice for them.Cornwall: In or Out?How immigration changed Boston, LincolnshireThe big questions on the EU referendumIn search of the European DreamMy Decision: How do key cultural figures plan to vote?"

Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave.Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost.Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure ""that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work"". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work.Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination.If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked.However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-17,One winner,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36143175,"The EU referendum is not just a fight to the death between two competing visions of Britain's future place in the world. It is also a battle between two tried-and-tested methods of winning a referendum.Vote Leave can trace its roots back to a largely forgotten referendum that took place in the North East of England in 2004. The then deputy prime minister John Prescott had long dreamed of a new tier of local government - regional assemblies - which he believed would shift the balance of power in the UK away from Westminster. But he got a rude awakening when the first region chosen for the experiment overwhelmingly rejected the idea in an all postal ballot.Prescott's dream, which had been backed by the local Labour-dominated political establishment, big business and much of the local media, and had begun the campaign with a big lead in the polls, had been sunk by an inflatable elephant.  The White Elephant was the mascot of North East Says No - a tightly-focused, agile campaign run by a group of young Eurosceptics, including Dominic Cummings, now the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign.It was one of the first political campaigns in the UK to tap into the ""anti-politics"" mood that was beginning to sweep the country. ""The messaging was all about being the cheeky upstarts. We were the insurgents, it was the anti-politics approach. It was the first time that approach had been taken,"" says Graham Robb, who was the campaign's chief spokesman, now the Remain-backing chairman of the North East branch of the Institute of Directors. North East Says No even had their own Nigel Farage, in ""metric martyr"" Neil Herron, a man-of-the-people market trader who had grabbed headlines with his campaign to protect imperial weights and measures. Mr Herron launched his own campaign against the regional assembly but lost out to North East Says No in the battle for the official Electoral Commission designation. He carried on regardless, but found himself being sidelined by the team with the White Elephant.""His campaign withered,"" says Mr Robb. ""He was mainly based in Sunderland so we let him get on with it.""Nigel Farage, whose favoured campaign lost out on the official designation to Vote Leave, probably knows how he feels, although the UKIP leader is still managing to make his voice heard... well beyond Sunderland.Many of the lessons learned in the North East were applied to the 2011 campaign to keep Britain's first-past-the-post voting system. The successful No2AV campaign was run by Matthew Elliott, the former boss of the Taxpayers Alliance, who is now Vote Leave's chief executive. The EU referendum campaign is very different - Cummings and Elliott are campaigning for a change to the status quo this time. But they are still playing the anti-establishment card for all it is worth, as they dismiss warnings from international bodies, groups of scientists and business people and world leaders about the dangers of Brexit. ""The establishment operates on the basis of herding around conventional wisdom,"" Mr Cummings told the Treasury select committee.  ""It is why the establishment has got every big foreign policy decision wrong since trying to deal with Bismarck in the 1860s.""But surely the campaign's two star spokesmen Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are members of this hated establishment?""They are champions of anti‑establishment, anti‑conventional wisdom and thinking, and Michael Gove has been like that for many a year,"" argued Cummings.Running an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign was not really an option for Britain Stronger In Europe. The prime minister and the leaders of every other traditional major party in the UK are all on board, after all.Instead, the campaign, which is being run by Labour activist Will Straw, son of former home secretary Jack, is taking its cues from Better Together, the 2014 campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.David Cameron's former head of strategy Andrew, now Lord, Cooper, whose focus group and polling insights were used to craft Better Together's core message is at the heart of the campaign.The key group in Scotland, Cooper found, were ""uncommitted security seekers"" - people who had no particular loyalty to the UK but who were worried about losing their jobs if Scotland went it alone.This led to a heavy focus on the risks of leaving - leading to the Better Together camp being dubbed ""Project Fear"" by the SNP. A name that stuck and is being applied with glee by Vote Leave to their opponents in the Remain camp.The Remain camp are not worried about ""Project Fear"" jibes because they are convinced such an approach works.Businessman Roland Rudd, who has been focus grouping and polling with Lord Cooper, told the Politicos website: ""I think you'll find that people's jobs are the most important thing in life. The fact that so many jobs are linked to the EU does come up in the focus groups. ""So the issue would be stronger by being in, rather than being cut off and risking the loss of trade and exports and free trade agreements.""Despite their different approaches, both sides are competing for the same voters - those who have yet to make up their minds - and they are facing the same set of challenges.They have both had to stitch together cross party coalitions and juggle the fragile egos of politicians who are more used to knocking lumps out of each other rather than working for a common cause.And they are both engaged in a daily battle to achieve the Holy Grail of all political campaigns - ""cut through"". Something that will stick in the mind of the average voter come polling day. Perhaps an eye-catching statistic about how leaving or remaining will directly affect them. Which can lead to some dubious claims on both sides.Unlike general elections, referendums are a winner-takes-all deal. You can't have another go five years later if you don't like the result. There is no prospect of a coalition if the result is close. Winning is everything and just like in war, the first casualty is often the truth. ""In a conventional election, people know what parties are liable to do and what powers are available to them,"" says Daily Herald political correspondent Tom Gordon, who covered the Scottish referendum. ""Referendums are a completely new scenario. Fiction can fill the void. There are fewer reference points. They can lay it on thick.""It is perfectly possible to run a bad referendum campaign and still win. Or to run a brilliant campaign and lose. One thing everyone agrees on is that if the public are not buying the product you are selling, no end of stunts and clever tricks will convince voters to change their mind. But you can guarantee that whichever side does win will claim it has discovered the winning formula for success in any future referendum."
2016-05-17,The US view,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36260543,"Before plunging into the question of why America cares so much about whether Britain remains a member of the European Union, let's make a quick distinction. America doesn't. The political establishment does. I suspect if you stop the average American on the street and ask what they think about Brexit, the assumption would be that you were talking about some delicious new biscuit.Brexit, the snack you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite. Or a Brexit a day helps you work, rest and play. Or something like that…Outside of the posh papers like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times there has been next to no discussion of next month's referendum in the UK. And I am willing to be corrected, but I think there has been precisely zero discussion of this issue on the US TV networks - with the notable exception of when Barack Obama was in London and weighed in at his news conference with David Cameron. And even then, for the US audience Britain's membership of the EU was of far less consequence than the lunch the president and the first lady had with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh the day after her 90th birthday - and, of course, the picture of the trip: the president and the prince in his dressing gown before bedtime.So having made that distinction, let's ask this question: does the Washington establishment really care that much? The simple answer is yes. First, let's deal with a canard. When I was in London with the president on his recent trip, it was suggested to me that the ""establishment"" in the US weren't really that interested one way or the other in the whole Brexit debate, but were intervening at Cameron's behest. He needed some help; they lent an old ally a hand. But this is arrant nonsense. You don't get a whole pile of former treasury secretaries to sign a letter to The Times of London if they don't believe what they're saying. The same goes for former US secretaries of state, defence secretaries, heads of the CIA and national security advisers. While it is certainly true that looking at the polls Cameron clearly does need a hand, and they have lent an old ally a hand, don't muddle cause and effect. This might be the effect of their intervention, but the reason for sticking their giant stars and stripes oar in is that there is profound disquiet in Washington about what the effects of a Brexit could be. And the concerns are NOT just about what harm this might do little old Britain (although that is a part of it); it's about the wider geopolitical ramifications that might flow from it.Dealing with Britain first, the US has always believed that the UK has been a vital part of the Transatlantic partnership. At times when relations have been fraught between Europe and the US, you will hear US policymakers talk about how the UK has acted as a bridge - able to relay messages to Brussels that Washington is anxious to convey, and vice versa. The ""special relationship"" means that there is unprecedented intelligence sharing and defence cooperation. There is something like 800 British service personnel in America at the moment, serving in all the branches of the US military. On trade, the Americans think that Britain will be seriously disadvantaged if it finds itself alone in the world having to negotiate a trade treaty with the US. As the president said - controversially - when he was in London, Britain would be at the back of the queue for any future deal.And then there is the wider concern. There is serious concern that Britain leaving the EU could destabilise the rest of the European Union. Would other European nations start to demand their own referendums on remaining part of the EU? Could the whole European project unravel? What would be the effects on the global economy at a time when nations are still emerging from the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis? What would be the effect on collective security? Why is Russia so keen on Brexit? In a world full of uncertainties and known unknowns, and unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld might say - interestingly one person who was NOT a signatory to this letter), Europe has been a source of stability, and a huge trading partner to the US. The TTIP trade deal is the prize that European and US policymakers are after. Not new sources of instability. Madeline Albright, who WAS a signatory to the letter is absolutely clear: It is in America's and the world's interests that Britain remains inside the European Union. And it is worth noting that there is barely a US politician who has held public office who IS an advocate of Brexit. So, yes, the American foreign-policy establishment is watching with serious concern and interest. Part of that can be judged by the letters to The London Times, and part of it can be judged by the number of invitations I am receiving to debates in Washington on this subject. It is the plat du jour.Except in Washington, Brexit is the snack they want to see removed from the menu."
2016-05-17,Overheard,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36260942,"David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people ""hate each other"", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was ""a total joke"". David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently ""purred"" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had ""never heard someone so happy"" at the result, and said she ""purred down the line"". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""extremely sorry"".With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a ""bigoted women"". Mr Brown later said he was ""mortified"" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: ""Yo, Blair. How are you doing?"" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as ""bastards"" he would like to ""crucify""."

2016-05-17,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160515032922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.Lords chief whip - Lord Bassam of BrightonFormer leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.Shadow minister without portfolio - Jonathan Ashworth Labour shadow cabinet in fullThe Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband. He backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership election over his Leicester neighbour Liz Kendall, telling the Leicester Mercury he had agonised over the decision.Shadow housing and planning minister - John HealeyMr Healey is shadowing a portfolio he held under Gordon Brown. The Wentworth and Dearne held a range of post during the Labour government, including financial secretary to the Treasury and local government minister.Shadow attorney general - Karl TurnerThe MP for Hull East took over the role of Labour's chief legal adviser after the resignation of Catherine McKinnell. Mr Turner represents the seat once held by deputy prime minister John Prescott. He was previously shadow solicitor general"

2016-05-18,Corbyn outlines 'new economics' vision,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36351149,"Labour will seek to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly, Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he set out his party's plans for the economy.Addressing activists, he called for a ""mixed economy of public and social enterprise... a private sector with a long-term private business commitment"".He said a Labour government would break from the ""failed economic orthodoxy"".Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesOsborne warns Brexit will hit house pricesAt Labour's ""state of the economy"" conference in west London, Mr Corbyn set out his desire to reform capitalism and said his party needed to ""deliver the new economy that this country needs"".""An economy that starts by tackling the grotesque levels of inequality within our society,"" went on Mr Corbyn. ""An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment.""Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  ""Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. ""A new economics.""He said: ""Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared.""By Chris Mason, BBC News political correspondentHaving survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch. Mr Corbyn called it ""a new economics"". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the ""fundamental business of reforming capitalism"".So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.No one can doubt their ambition: ""I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform,"" the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS. But to do that, they have to win the next general election.Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough so they can fight that election? And if they do, can Messrs Corbyn and McDonnell sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money. ""We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances,"" he said. Councils would be given the power to limit ""skyrocketing"" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people ""at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market"".The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.The ""local rent regulation"" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to ""pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords"", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was ""creating a bigger and better private rented sector"". ""These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent,"" she said."

2016-05-18,Osborne 'Pinocchio' on Brexit forecast,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36351310,"Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has compared George Osborne to ""Pinocchio"" over his claim that a vote to leave the EU would cause an economic shock to UK house prices.The chancellor earlier said that in the event of a vote for Brexit, by 2018, houses could be worth up to 18% less than if the UK voted to remain.But Mr Duncan Smith said the claim reminded him of ""the nose growing rather long"". Treasury analysis is due next week. Its report will suggest that two years after a Brexit vote, UK house prices could be between 10% and 18% lower than after a remain vote.""If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like,"" Mr Osborne said.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowG7 finance ministers also think a UK exit would cause a ""shock"" to the world economy.After two-day talks in Japan they said it would complicate the world economy alongside geopolitical conflict, terrorism and the refugee crisis.The International Monetary Fund last Friday also said Brexit could cause a ""sharp drop"" in house prices.But former Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, cast doubt on the chancellor's forecast, saying: ""When I heard that I did think of Pinocchio and the nose growing rather long here.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.He said Mr Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2010 because Treasury reports could not be trusted as ""they were always fiddled with by chancellors of the exchequer"". He also said that the Treasury had failed to predict either the recession or a November fall in tax receipts. ""Now what we have had is a whole series of Treasury reports telling us the world is going to end, we are going to end up with lower house prices, the economy is going to be bad,"" he said. ""Even the Treasury has to admit under their most pessimistic forecast, the British economy would continue to grow after we left the European Union. And, this report also says house prices would continue to grow. ""My point is very simple, they do not know.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonWith four and a bit weeks to go until referendum day, voters find themselves swimming in a murky ocean of questionable statistics. And when I say questionable, I'm being polite.August bodies and grand figures on both sides are making bold claims. And they are both guessing. So what's happening here? Each side is playing what it sees as its greatest hit. The let's stay in brigade talk about the economy. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.The let's get out brigade talk about immigration. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.There will be plenty more claims where these came from before you pick up that stubby little pencil in a draughty polling station.Mr Osborne earlier told the BBC an ""economic shock"" would follow a vote for Britain to leave the EU. ""In the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer,"" he said. ""That affects the value of people's homes. And at the same time, first-time buyers are hit because mortgage rates go up, and mortgages become more difficult to get. So it's a lose-lose situation.""Campaigners for Vote Leave have previously said that lower house prices would help first-time buyers and those in the rental market.Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable tweeted: ""Osborne on house prices. Surely big price fall good for affordability and economic balance. Stick to jobs and basic economics George.""On Thursday, estate agents claimed a Brexit would take about £2,200 off average house prices by 2018.Ratings agency Moody's also said curbing immigration would ease competition for housing, and slow down house price and rental inflation.Also on Saturday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged mothers to vote for the UK to stay in the EU for the sake of their children.He told a conference of left-of-centre think tank the Fabian Society: ""To mothers who are worried about the prospects for their children in the future and want to know where the jobs will come from, to people who feel that globalisation is a runaway train and it's out of control and uncontrollable, we've got to show that we can manage that in the public interest.""

2016-05-18,Staying in EU adds 5m to population - Gove,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36341206,"Staying in the EU could increase the UK's population by up to 5.23m by 2030, Vote Leave has claimed, putting the NHS under ""unsustainable"" pressure.Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the estimates were ""robust"" and voting to leave the EU would strengthen the NHS.He argued the National Living Wage was an extra ""pull factor"" for migrants. Remain campaigners say the 5m figure is ""absurd"" as it is based on five states joining the EU by 2020, which they say ""is not remotely on the cards"".Politics Live: Updates from the EU referendum campaignPrime Minister David Cameron has said it will be ""decades"" before Turkey joins the EU and there is no firm date for the accession of Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia.A document from Vote Leave says the EU's commitment to the free movement of people and the UK's new National Living Wage mean net migration from the EU to the UK will be between 170,000 and 430,000 a year - adding between 2.58m and 5.23m people to the UK population by 2030.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.The group calculates the NHS could have to contend with a new group of patients the size of ""four Birminghams"", and A&E demand could increase by up to 57%. Voting to leave could mean ""millions of pounds saved in ending EU contributions"" could be given to ""strengthen"" the NHS instead, Mr Gove said. ""Boris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear that the NHS will only face additional pressures. ""Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU into UK every year.""But the EU was committed to allowing five new countries to join, he said, whose citizens would ""inevitably"" be attracted to the UK: ""The idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable.""The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Read moreThe Office for National Statistics predicts that net migration to the UK - from countries across the world, not just the EU - will add up to just under three million by 2029.Vote Leave says the ONS has ""consistently underestimated the true level of migration"" in the past and there are ""strong reasons to doubt this forecast"".Mr Gove stood by the Vote Leave figures, describing them as ""robust and methodologically fair"" and denied abandoning the economic argument - which Vote Leave had been focused on at the start of the campaign - to concentrate on immigration. But the Remain campaign said it was ""absurd"" to base figures on five new EU states by 2020 and the UK could veto any new country joining, and apply restrictions on free movement for new EU states.They pointed to comments made by Vote Leave's Boris Johnson to LBC radio in March, when he said Turkey would not join the EU ""in the foreseeable future"" and the idea of 75 million Turks having visa-free travel was ""simply not on the cards"".Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is campaigning the UK to remain in the EU, said: ""I think these figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they're not designed to inform - they're designed to confuse.""And former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said: ""Wrecking the economy by leaving Europe would make our NHS weaker - and patients would pay the price.""These figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU's Single Market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people's wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a £36 billion black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service.""""Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.""Meanwhile European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Le Monde that Britain would have to accept being treated like an outsider if it votes to leave the EU. ""Deserters won't be welcomed with open arms,"" he said.""That is not a threat, but our relations will no longer be as they are today"".But UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker's ""whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels"" adding: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat.""And Vote Leave's Labour chair Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low."""
2016-05-18,Trump: I've been asked to Downing Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36344771,"US presidential hopeful Donald Trump says he has been asked to visit Downing Street - and expects to ""do just fine"" with Prime Minister David Cameron.But No 10 said while it was traditional to meet US candidates visiting the UK, no invitations had been issued.A spokeswoman said there were ""no confirmed dates"" for visits as party nominees had not yet been chosen.The PM previously called Mr Trump's proposal for a ban on Muslims entering the US ""stupid, divisive and wrong"". Last year Mr Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidential election, said many Muslims nursed a ""hatred"" towards America and a ban should be in force ""until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"". By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editorWhile it is true that hopefuls like Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio met the prime-minister when they were passing through London - that was before they had declared they were candidates for the Republican nomination. A senior source said the PM would be happy to see Mr Trump once he becomes the official nominee - that will happen after the Republican Convention in July. Four years ago the then Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, visited Downing Street - and caused consternation when he criticised Britain's preparedness for hosting the London 2012 Olympics.

2016-05-18,Two Britons lose EU vote legal bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36341839,"Two Britons living abroad have lost their Court of Appeal battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.The challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan, 54.Under law, UK citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote. The pair took the case to the Court of Appeal after losing their application for a judicial review last month. Mr Shindler and Ms MacLennan had argued the in-out vote on EU membership, on 23 June, directly affected them and brought the test case on behalf of others in their situation.In April, they asked High Court judges to declare that section two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established ""the 15-year rule"", unlawfully acted as a penalty for their having exercised their rights to free movement.But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.They then took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a one-day hearing took place earlier this month. Three appeal judges - Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King - upheld the High Court decision on Friday, declaring the rule did not unlawfully interfere with the right of expats to freedom of movement within the European Union.EU campaign latestEU vote: All you need to knowUK stars back remaining in EUStudents risk missing voteLord Dyson said: ""The claimants say that their exclusion from the franchise is an unjustified restriction on their EU right - EU law right - of free movement and contrary to their constitutional, common law right to vote. ""The appeals against the dismissal of their claims is dismissed. The court holds first that the 2015 Act does not fall within the scope of EU law at all, so that the claim fails at the first hurdle.""He added that ""the common law right to vote does not take precedence over an Act of Parliament"" and refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The expats still have the right to ask Supreme Court judges to consider the case, however. Their lawyers said a hearing had been listed for Tuesday, at which permission to appeal - as well as the substance of the appeal itself - would be considered.Those eligible can register to vote here.The non-Britons who get an EU voteMs McLennan, who is originally from Inverness but has lived in Brussels since 1987, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The refusal to allow me and others in my situation to vote is an infringement of my EU rights.""She added that the result of the vote ""would have a huge impact"" on both her personal and professional life, and that she often returned to the UK to visit her parents and children, and for work. ""I feel very strongly that I ought to have a fundamental democratic right to vote in my country of citizenship,"" said Ms McLennan.Mr Shindler, appointed an MBE for Anglo-Italian relations in 2014, has been told he has ""diminished or diluted"" links to the UK after living abroad for so long. He has lived in Italy for 35 years. The UK passport holder, originally from London, said: ""The fact that we don't live there doesn't alter that fact, we were born British and we will remain that way. ""If we go and live somewhere else, it doesn't make us anything else. They work out here. People don't know who these expats are you know, think they're all on holiday.""He also said the government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed.Law firm Leigh Day, which represents the pair, argued that up to two million British citizens were being unlawfully denied the right to vote on membership of the EU."
2016-05-18,Care 'could suffer' as NHS busts budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36341235,"Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out. Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"".""We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care.""The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service. There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS ""could not be bleaker"".""The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.""There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.""Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black holeFinancial problems 'endemic in the NHS'Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Nearly nine in 10 hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterTaken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was ""cooking up accounting alchemy"" by ""turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury"". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎""We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff,"" he added.The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published."
2016-05-18,Scores of UK stars back remaining in EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36338220,"Jude Law, Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch are among stars who have signed a letter saying Brexit would ""damage"" the creative industry.Almost 300 actors, musicians, writers and artists are backing calls for the UK to stay in the EU.They say ""vital EU funding"" and work across borders has been key to projects from galleries to blockbusters.But House of Cards author Lord Dobbs said British success in the industry was ""not because of the EU"".Among others backing the letter are actors Bill Nighy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sir John Hurt, Sir Patrick Stewart and Thandie Newton, architect Richard Rogers, artist Tracey Emin, author John le Carre, comedian Jo Brand, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, director Richard Curtis and writer Philip Pullman.The letter, organised by the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, says: ""Britain is not just stronger in Europe, it is more imaginative and more creative, and our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away.""It adds: ""Leaving Europe would be a leap into the unknown for millions of people across the UK who work in the creative industries, and for the millions more at home and abroad who benefit from the growth and vibrancy of Britain's cultural sector.""""We believe that being part of the EU bolsters Britain's leading role on the world stage. Let's not become an outsider shouting from the wings.""The Stronger In campaign says that more than 2.2 million people are employed in the UK's creative industries and digital sector. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.It argues that the creative and digital industries export billions of pounds of services to the EU and are among the fastest-growing sectors of the UK economy.Prime Minister David Cameron met some of the stars campaigning for Remain at a visit to the famous Abbey Road studios in London, with former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell.Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign, said leaving the EU would mean higher tariffs on exports and digital and creative industries were ""better off with the UK in EU"" with access to the single market.But speaking in a personal capacity, the Conservative peer and author Lord Dobbs, said: ""Our creative industries are booming because of the talent that is in Britain's DNA. ""We are world leaders in so many creative areas. From theatre to literature, video games, feature films, fashion, music and so much else, British artists lead the way and are celebrated around the globe. ""It's a success that has been created by the dedication, hard work and extraordinary creative abilities of our artists, it's not because of the EU."" He added: ""Culture owes nothing to committees. ""Ancient Greece was the birthplace of our civilisation yet today, because of the EU's appalling policies, streets that were once filled with the world's greatest philosophers and playwrights are choked with desperate beggars and mountains of rotting rubbish. ""These are the realities of the EU. It's failing. The dream is dead. We need to move on.""Conservative Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he did not think people should be ""swayed by celebrities"".Meanwhile Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has entered the debate, warning that Canada's own trade deal with the EU had taken more than ten years to negotiate and was yet to enter force.""There's nothing easy or automatic about that,"" he said.""Britain is always going to have clout, it's just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU. I believe we're always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn't seem to be a productive path for countries.""The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has defended Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's intervention in the debate last week, when he warned that a vote to leave could cause a recession.Mr Trichet told BBC's This Week's World there was an ""obligation"" for the central bank to ""say candidly what they see"".Those behind the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union said Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the risks of Brexit. Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC he ""wouldn't expect"" a major financial institution to back the Leave campaign ""because they all wanted to protect the status quo"".And Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, has described ""this daily avalanche of institutional propaganda"" as ""ludicrous and pitiful"".

2016-05-18,MP brands voter 'a horrible racist',https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-36334488,"A Labour MP campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU has apologised after being recorded calling a voter a ""horrible racist"".Shadow Europe minister Pat Glass made the comments after an interview with BBC Radio Derby in Sawley, Derbyshire.She said: ""The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.Updates on this story and more from DerbyshireThe man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them. ""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"". ""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this."" Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""But she accused Leave campaigners of offering ""false promises"" that if the UK left the EU there would be a ""substantial"" change on migration policy."
2016-05-18,Cameron heads off EU trade deal revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36332415,"Downing Street has headed off a revolt over the Queen's Speech by saying it will accept a move to exclude the NHS from a controversial EU-US trade deal. Tory rebels were threatening to join Labour and the SNP to back an amendment ""regretting"" the lack of a bill to protect the NHS from the TTIP deal.But Downing Street has denied them the chance by saying they will back it.One of the MPs tabling the amendment, Labour's Paula Sherriff, described it as a ""humiliating climbdown"" by the PM.""They will now be the first government in history to officially 'regret' their own programme within days of announcing it, just months after doing the same on their Budget,"" she said.Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Steve Baker MP said: ""The government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.""But a spokesman for Number 10 said: ""As we've said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this amendment is selected, we'll accept it.""Also on Thursday, David Cameron told LBC radio  he did not want the EU referendum to become a ""Tory psycho-drama"" involving him and senior ""Leave"" Conservatives Boris Johnson and Michael Gove but claimed former London mayor Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a leaver"". He also described himself as a Eurosceptic but said he believed it was better that the UK remain in the EU.Mr Johnson, in response, said he had been a ""Eurosceptic for decades"" and said: ""I urge my friends in government to recognise that in all logic, and as self-declared Eurosceptics, they should really be campaigning with us on this side of the argument.""The TTIP amendment - signed by 25 Tory MPs - expressed regret that the government has not brought forward a bill to protect the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, currently being negotiated between the EU and the US. Although it would have been a purely symbolic vote, no government has suffered a defeat on a Queen's Speech, which sets out its legislative programme for the year ahead, since 1924.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long opposed TTIP, had said he would back the Conservative rebels.It is understood the SNP and other minority parties were also likely to support the amendment.Sources in the Vote Leave campaign predicted the government had faced defeat unless it backed down.Conservative former minister Peter Lilley, who supported the amendment, said that although he supports free trade, TTIP would introduce ""special courts which are not necessary for free trade, will give American multinationals the right to sue our government (but not vice versa) and could put our NHS at risk"".TTIP is primarily a deal to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade between the US and EU countries, making it potentially easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other's markets.Industries it would affect include pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing and food and drink.The government says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars.In the UK, attention has focused on the potential impact on the NHS, with critics saying TTIP would allow private firms running NHS services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector.What is the future for UK-US trade?Labour MP Frank Field, who backed the amendment, said: ""We can't have kangaroo courts, operating only to America's advantage, deciding how we should trade in respect of the NHS.""SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: ""The SNP have been at the forefront of the campaign to protect the NHS and other public services from the potential consequences of TTIP, and so we welcome any opportunity to ensure that the Tory government keep the promises they have already made.""But former Labour minister Rachel Reeves, writing on the Labour List website, said: ""Those who want Britain to leave the EU need to stop preying on British peoples' love for the NHS by cynically pretending that TTIP poses a threat. It does not. ""They are demeaning their own campaign by arguing a case they know to be untrue.""But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who like Ms Reeves is backing the Remain campaign, said she would vote for the amendment.She said: ""If we left the EU, then we could be left with the government negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. What then? ""With the Tories still in charge, we could then expect the roll out of multiple TTIPs on steroids as Britain negotiated trade deals with countries across the world."""
2016-05-18,Lib Dem cabinet post welcomed by Farron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36335307,"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has welcomed Kirsty Williams's plan to be education secretary in an otherwise all Labour Welsh Government.  Mr Farron said she would ""retain her independence"" and aim to make education in Wales ""markedly better"" then in the rest of the UK. Ms Williams's appointment is subject to a vote of Welsh Lib Dem members at a special conference on Saturday.She has said she is not taking party support on the matter for granted.The AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, who boosted her majority over the Conservatives at the assembly election to more than 8,000, was named by First Minister Carwyn Jones on Thursday as part of an eight-member cabinet.Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme on Friday, Mr Farron said Ms Williams's cabinet role would be ""great news for education in Wales"". ""Kirsty has that great strength of somebody with great experience of education, the mother of three children who are in Welsh state schools, and somebody who's very committed to making a difference."" Mr Farron said he was ""very impressed"" with the ""hard achievements"" the Liberal Democrats would get out of the agreement with Labour.""But my aim is, and Kirsty's aim will be, that education in Wales will be markedly better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of Kirsty and the Liberal Democrats' involvement in this administration."" Asked if she was confident of getting her party's support, the former Welsh Lib Dem leader said: ""I never take anything for granted in politics.""The great thing about being a member of the Welsh Liberal Democrats [is that] it's not up to individuals to make these choices. ""Every single member of our party will have an opportunity to have their say and have a vote on this decision.""Ms Williams denied her appointment would effectively mean her party ceased to exist in the assembly.""It exists with a cabinet minister, hopefully subject to the party agreement, being able to implement Welsh Liberal Democrat policies and influencing the agenda,"" she said.""That's a lot stronger than being a single assembly member on a backbench.""Ms Williams said she would never leave her party, and did not think Labour, Plaid and the Welsh Liberal Democrats should merge or have a formal relationship.""There are different traditions and political strands that are represented by each of the parties.""What is important is that we look to work where we can together and recognise that the way in which politics happens in Wales is changing.""It isn't about one single party driving home their manifesto without due reference to other voices.""The deal between Ms Williams and Labour agrees a list of nine common priorities which include pledges from the Welsh Lib Dem election manifesto, such as:It also calls for the upcoming recommendations of the Diamond Review into student finance to be considered ""with a view to early implementation where appropriate"" but with no ""negative effect"" on the higher education budget.The Lib Dem tuition fee policy at the election was to end tuition fee support grants that students currently get. The party proposed to replace it with a student living support grant funded by the other grant's withdrawal - but this is not written into the agreement.Ms Williams was the only opposition AM to back Mr Jones in the first deadlocked vote for first minister - despite Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP supporting Plaid leader Leanne Wood.Mr Jones was later reinstated after he came to an agreement with Plaid Cymru - although no members of that party were appointed to his cabinet.Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said it is unlikely all the policies in the agreement between Ms Williams and Welsh Labour will get support of parties outside the government.He said on Twitter: ""Important to note these policies will need opposition support to be implemented. Unlikely that all will succeed.""The senior Plaid figure also questioned the Lib Dems' pledge in the agreement to reduce infant class sizes to 25.He said that ""most evidence suggests you need to reduce to 15 to have any real effect. Reducing to 25 is costly but ineffective"".Meanwhile UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said Ms Williams should resign her seat and seek a fresh mandate in a by-election.He said: ""When UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless left their old parties, they did the honourable thing and went back to their electors at a by-election to seek a new mandate to represent them.""Kirsty is now duty bound to support Labour 100% over this five-year assembly term. ""I call on her to take the same honourable course and seek a fresh mandate from her constituents because, in all but name, she has now become a Labour AM."" "
2016-05-18,Students risk missing referendum vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36303347,"UK university students believe the EU referendum is key to their future, but almost two-thirds do not know when it is, suggests research. And a third of more than 2,000 students questioned feared being unable to get to their polling station on the day. The referendum, on 23 June, is outside term time, so many students will need to re-register at their home address, says the National Union of Students. NUS vice-president Richard Brooks urged students ""to think ahead"". ""The EU referendum is a once-in-a-generation vote,"" said Mr Brooks. ""The decision made on the 23 June will impact young people and students the most, as they are the ones that will live with the consequences for the longest.""If students don't want their future decided for them, it is essential that as many as possible get out and vote.""Mr Brooks urged students to think about where they would be on referendum day and to make sure they register or re-register at the right address. ""If they are unsure about where they will be, students can register at both their term-time and home address, providing they only vote once,"" he said.""If they are going to be on holiday or are heading to Glastonbury, they should apply for a postal vote.""People had until 17:00 on 7 June to register if they wanted to vote in the referendum, he added. It is also possible to apply for a postal or proxy vote by 17:00 on 8 June. The interviews, carried out this month on a representative sample of students from across the UK by YouthSight for Universities UK, found: Universities UK and the Association of Colleges are holding voter registration drives at institutions across the UK. Students will be advised to register, re-register or apply for proxy or postal votes, according to their circumstances. UUK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said it was of ""real concern"" that so many students were unaware of the referendum date and that they might have to re-register to vote at another address. ""From this week, universities will be scaling up their efforts to encourage students to register to vote, and to make sure they do so in the right location,"" she said.""With nearly two million UK students eligible to vote in the referendum, it is vital that they have all the necessary information to make sure they can take part in this hugely important decision."""

A Downing Street spokesman said ""we don't accept"" Mr Baker's claims. In other EU referendum campaign developments:The government is campaigning for a vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum and Prime Minister David Cameron, whose party is divided on the issue, has previously called for a ""respectful"" debate. But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate ""breathtakingly disheartening"".Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in ""Downing Street hostage videos"".Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended ""into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people"".He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as ""economically illiterate"" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his ""preposterous, obscene"" remarks.""I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,"" said Mr Baker.Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as ""from the past"" following his intervention.Mr Baker claimed there had been ""intolerable media smears"" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: ""It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.""He added: ""If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign ""can't make an honest and positive case"" because they ""know it's a losing argument"".""So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,"" he said. He added: ""What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't accept Steve Baker's article.""All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.""The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: ""Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.""In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based ""employees worse off"".Writing in The Times, he warned financial jobs could leave London for Paris or Frankfurt and said ""a vote to leave is a risk""."

2016-05-18,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"The referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union, or remain a member, is on 23 June. So far, opinion polls suggest the campaign has had little impact on voters. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes assesses what the polls may be telling us.Read the full methodologyThere's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months. The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters. That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention. Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote. ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-18,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-18,Resident rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36316467,"It might seem peculiar that a young Australian here in Britain on a two-year working holiday is allowed to have a say on whether the UK should leave the European Union. But Michael Ingle, a 27-year-old physiotherapist living in Surrey, defends his right to participate in the 23 June referendum.He says that as a taxpayer, and a citizen of the Commonwealth, what happens to Britain is important to him and will have ramifications for the wider world well beyond the cliffs of Dover.""It's not just about Britain for me, which is why I've taken an interest in it,"" Mr Ingle, from Sydney, says.""It's about the West and the stability of this continent.""As a hangover from the days of empire, when so-called ""British subjects"" were included in the parliamentary franchise, Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK without British nationality retain the right to vote in elections.Estimates based on the 2011 census put the number of Commonwealth citizens eligible to vote in the forthcoming referendum at between 894,000 and more than 960,000.They join Irish citizens as the only non-Brits allowed to vote in what David Cameron has called a ""once in a generation"" decision. This has drawn the ire of groups including Migration Watch UK.Its chair, Lord Green of Deddington, says that ""important decisions about Britain should be taken by those who are British citizens and only by them"".A petition to parliament signed by more than 40,000 people, meanwhile, has claimed that allowing non-Brits to vote would bias the result towards the Remain side, especially given that the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta are also in the EU.But regardless of whether one agrees with the voting rules, such claims treat Commonwealth voters as a homogenous bloc of sorts, destined to vote in the same way.This obscures the fact that Commonwealth citizens living in Britain come from a diverse range of 53 countries in all the world's time zones.Voters of even the same age and nationality can have vastly different views on the subject at hand.Take Farhan Samsudin and Zila Fawzi, two young Malaysian women living in London.Farhan, who works in banking, says she will vote Remain on 23 June, despite what she says is the failure of either campaign to provide information on how the ""Commonwealth constituency"" might be affected by the result.She thinks the UK should strengthen its economic ties with Asian economies like Malaysia and sees membership of the EU as an obstacle in trade negotiations.Yet, with no clear plans presented to her on how a post-EU Britain would approach the world, she says she'll vote to stay.Zila, on the other hand, who is on a British government-funded scholarship, supports an EU exit.Her vote will be pinned on hopes that immigration policy will change in a way that benefits Commonwealth citizens if the UK no longer has to abide by free movement within the EU.""Once they are out of the EU it would be easier, especially for us Malaysians, to come and work here,"" she says.A postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, Zila is frustrated by the fact that any EU citizen is allowed to work in the UK, while highly educated Commonwealth citizens like her are turned away.On this point, Farhan chimes in.""The British government sponsors brilliant minds like her but they don't give any leeway for her to work here,"" she says, shaking her head. ""It's a real waste.""Avenues for Commonwealth citizens to migrate to the UK have become increasingly slim since the abolishment of working holiday visas (now limited to just a handful of countries under the Youth Mobility Scheme) and the post-study work visa, which allowed students to stay on for two years after the end of their course.Foreign students from outside the EU, many of whom are from the Commonwealth, now have just four months to find a job if they want to stay.The recent introduction of a £35,000 income threshold for non-EU skilled workers to settle in the UK in a bid to reduce net migration has led to further frustration and the spectre of mass deportations.Yet, while it would seem as though pro-Brexit campaigners could capitalise on the prickly issue of immigration in order to draw Commonwealth voters to their side, the issue is not so clear-cut.Given that some of the constituencies that the Leave campaign are courting harbour anti-immigrant sentiment, making a pitch to Commonwealth voters to back an EU exit based on immigration potential could see it take a hit elsewhere, says Ralph Buckle, director of the Commonwealth Exchange think tank.""Everyone has this number of what they think the right level of immigration is. It depends whether that number is high enough to include an increase [from] the Commonwealth.""The government's target of getting net migration under 100,000 annually also hovers ominously over any suggestion that more places could go to Commonwealth citizens if Brexit eventuated.The official Vote Leave campaign has said Britain could have a ""fairer"" migration policy that would ""make it easier for some to come, such as scientists and job-creators"" if the UK left the EU.In February Vote Leave published a letter to David Cameron from community and business leaders with Commonwealth links criticising immigration policy.""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom,"" they said.But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, speaking for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said that leaving the EU in order to end free movement would hurt everyone in Britain economically, including Commonwealth citizens.""Commonwealth citizens living in the UK benefit from jobs, lower prices and financial security we get from being part of the world's largest single market.""Commonwealth countries around the world, from Australia to Jamaica, are urging us to stay in the EU,"" he said.In a newspaper article last August, Lord Howell, chairman of Commonwealth Exchange and a former Conservative minister, said the polarity of the EU question was ""maddeningly oversimplified"" for internationally-minded Commonwealth citizens.He said the Leave campaign could not fall back on a ""little England mantra"", while the Remain camp would have to move away from ""seeing the continent as the UK's only future"".Mark Sultana, a 48-year-old long-time UK resident who organises events for fellow Canadians living in London, sees both sides of the picture.While he bemoans ""all the wastage and all the subsidies"" of the EU, he fears financial instability and losing the right to retire on the continent.""The whole thing is so complicated,"" he says.""I think ultimately even though I'm so anti all these things, so many things that the EU stands for… from the point of view of economic stability, the fact you're in it and that the world should be [becoming] a smaller place not a bigger place… [I would vote with] a grudging and qualified yes.""Mark also points out that the immigration argument means different things for different Commonwealth citizens.Canadians who live in the UK by virtue of European ancestry like himself, for example, might be fearful of losing that right in the case of a Brexit.""For that generation of that ilk, who came here, the European Union is very important. If you have Brexit there's a whole lot of people who would have trouble coming here.""For Brad Argent, meanwhile, having to deal with UK visa hassles despite being married to an English woman makes him feel like ""a second-class citizen"".The 50-year-old Australian, who works for an internet business, needs to wait for five years to get residency.""Whereas if I'm from Europe I can just come over on the train and set up house,"" he says outside Australia's High Commission on the Strand in London, where he has come to renew his passport.But Brad won't carry his these grievances to the ballot box, least of all because he does not want his British children to lose the right to work in the continent.""I think a vote to leave just out of spite because I'm a member of the Commonwealth, whilst that might feel good for about five minutes, I think the longer term implications I would start to regret,"" he says.With Commonwealth migrants unlikely to vote as a uniform bloc due to their divergent interests and circumstances, it appears either camp could still make a pitch to this 'constituency', which has largely been ignored in the debate thus far.After all, a million votes are at stake."
2016-05-18,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36345081,"The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Justice Secretary Michael Gove has unveiled Vote Leave's research on the effect free movement will have on the National Health Service.The document makes broad predictions, but even so, some of the assumptions it makes are questionable.The lower end of the forecast, that EU migration will rise by 2.58 million by 2030, is based on taking the most recent ONS net migration figure and multiplying it by 15.But the ONS actually produces a forecast for total net migration by 2029 (so not just from the EU), which it expects to have added 3 million to the population by then.Now there are uncertainties surrounding all forecasts, but it makes the bottom end of Vote Leave's forecast look somewhat high by comparison.To get to the higher ends of the forecast, the research assumes that all five current candidate countries wanting to join the EU (Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and FYR Macedonia) do so in 2020. This is very unlikely to happen. You can read more about why Turkey in particular is not going to join the EU by 2020 here. They also assume no transitional controls to limit migration from the new members. Existing states are allowed to impose seven years of restrictions to freedom of movement from new members, as the UK did with Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.Add to that the impact of the new National Living Wage and you get to Vote Leave's ""high"" forecast of 5.23 million. The quote from Michael Gove above is supposed to illustrate the ""medium"" forecast, which excludes the effect of the National Living Wage to get to a figure of 4.25 million. The population of Birmingham is about 1.1 million.It is hard to completely discount any forecast. Even so, the line about four Birminghams is hard to justify based on these such assumptions.From the figures on the growing population, the research gets to a figure on the extra demand from A&E departments, concluding that it would lead to an increase in demand of between 28% and 57%.It has reached these figures by looking at increases in A&E attendance since 2002 and noting a strong correlation with cumulative net migration over that time. In other words, attendances to A&E went up quickly at a time when there was continuous net migration to the UK.This relationship is then used to predict how future migration would affect demand for A&E.The problem is that while demand for A&E has gone up at the same time as there has been migration, the research has not demonstrated that one has caused the other.While it is clearly true that higher numbers of migrants would mean more A&E visits, it could be that A&E attendances have gone up for other reasons as well, so the relationship is not reliable.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-18,House of Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36330992,"It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that ""my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons"", she was signalling a retreat. Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers. A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits. Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention -  an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation. Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions. Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.Government to review Lords powers after tax credits defeatLimiting Lords powers 'calls its future into question'It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords. ""We're defeating the government more often than is good for us,"" a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?807Peers247 Conservative 211 Labour 175 Crossbench 109 Liberal Democrat Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation. My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight. 650Members of Parliament330 Conservative 229 Labour 54 SNP 8 Liberal Democrat ""There's no point in us existing,"" he told me, ""if we don't vote for the things we believe in.""That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened. In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems;  in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247. Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election. ""The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords,"" he says.Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place. ""It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is,"" says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a ""spurious"" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time. He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake. The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.""We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event,"" he said.David Cameron's real problem isn't peers, Lib Dem or otherwise. It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled. Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government. It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem. "

You could also look at the number of non-UK nationals (rather than everyone born abroad, which includes British citizens). They account for 56% of the rise.Responding to the latest unemployment figures, Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: ""Our labour market is thriving, but it's notable that more than three quarters of the rise in employment over the last year has come from people born abroad.""The figures suggest that people born abroad account for 80% of the rise in employment - as Mr Duncan Smith says, more than three quarters. But the figure for the number of people born abroad includes UK nationals who were born in other countries.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces figures for non-UK nationals working in the UK, which suggests 56% of the increase in employment may be attributed to non-UK nationals.In the context of the referendum the broader point the Leave Campaign has been making is that there's been a big increase in the proportion of people working in the UK who are EU nationals.The proportion of UK workers who are non-UK EU nationals has indeed increased considerably. In the first three months of this year, about 6.8% of UK workers were non-UK EU nationals. Five years ago that figure was 4.5% and 10 years ago it was 2.6%. If you look at the numbers behind that, at the moment there are 2.15 million EU nationals working in the UK. Five years ago it was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-18,War of words,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36304729,"The EU referendum debate is rapidly turning into a festival of name-calling and insults. How did we get here?It all started out so well. David Cameron decided to allow members of his cabinet to campaign for either side in the EU referendum. Some argue he had no choice, given the likelihood of resignations. Others wondered how it would work, with big personalities like Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith having public disagreements with Mr Cameron and George Osborne one minute and then calmly putting aside their differences the next to get on with running the country. But both sides insisted they could be grown up about it.  ""We should all be big enough to have an honest and open, but polite disagreement, and then come back together again afterwards,"" said Mr Cameron.Announcing his decision to join the Leave campaign in February, Boris Johnson praised the PM's renegotiation attempts, and urged his divided Conservative colleagues to ""play the ball and not the man"". There was plenty of ill-feeling flying around before the debate proper got under way, with a bitter and personal row between the two rival Leave campaigns and mutterings from Eurosceptic backbenchers about how little they thought Mr Cameron had achieved in his renegotiations.But the big beasts managed to keep it relatively civil, with personal attacks couched in the coded language of Westminster. David Cameron's comments in the Commons, shortly after Boris Johnson joined the Leave camp, about having ""no other agenda than what is best for our country"" was interpreted as a jibe at the former London mayor's leadership ambitions. It was written up in the press as a ""war"" between the two men. Iain Duncan Smith may have resigned from the Cabinet over cuts to disability benefits in March's Budget - but it gave him freedom to say what he really thinks about David Cameron and George Osborne and their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. And he has not held back. He has been scathing about Mr Cameron's renegotiations, claiming he achieved ""nothing"", and has accused the Remain campaign of ""spin, smears and threats"" to try to ""bully"" Britons into voting to stay. He has also appealed for calm, warning that all the rows risk long-term damage to the Conservative Party.What has enraged the Leave camp, possibly more than anything else, is the way in which they think the prime minister has used the might of the government machine to rig the referendum debate in his favour. The government's decision, in April, to spend £9m on sending a glossy brochure to every household in the country led to loud cries of foul play. David Cameron said the government was entitled to state its case. But Boris Johnson claimed the PM had reneged on his promise to ""fight fair"" during the referendum because he was ""losing the argument"". The Treasury's analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit provoked an even more furious reaction from the Leavers, particularly when George Osborne accused them of being ""economically illiterate"". The former Mayor of London has been on vintage form during this campaign, dreaming up ever more inventive ways of trashing the Remain campaign, headed by his old friend and rival David Cameron.He has compared them to jeweller Gerald Ratner, who famously called his own products ""crap"". He has described the global leaders backing the Remain campaign as appearing in Downing Street ""hostage videos"".A visit to an underwear factory in Derbyshire proved to be a target rich environment for the ex-Mayor.He compared the EU to a ""badly designed undergarment"", shouted ""pants on fire"" at the Remain campaign, before unleashing the inevitable battle cry:  ""Knickers to all those who talk Britain down.""David Cameron has largely avoided slinging mud back at Boris, but another Old Etonian Conservative MP has stepped manfully into the breach. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill and ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, is not a fan of the former London mayor, it seems.When Mr Johnson penned an article referencing Barack Obama's ""part Kenyan"" ancestry, Sir Nicholas had this to say on LBC radio:  ""I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive.""Sir Nicholas has kept up the Boris-baiting on his Twitter account, calling him the ""unchallenged master of the self inflicted wound"" and branding his comments about Hitler and the EU ""absurd, desperate and outright offensive"".With Labour MPs and members overwhelmingly supportive of the Remain campaign, ""red on red"" attacks have been less frequent than the ""blue on blue"" variety.  But Jeremy Corbyn's previous Eurosceptic sentiments have not gone unnoticed by the Labour Leave campaign. Labour MP Kate Hoey suggested the Labour leader (motto ""straight talking, honest politics"") was being less than straight with his decision to embrace the Remain cause.She said Labour voters would ""see through"" him. ""We know first of all, that he doesn't really mean it, no matter how much he tries to pretend he does, and secondly, that it is not in the interest of the Labour movement,"" she told the BBC News channel.Mr Corbyn says he wants to stay in the EU to fight for social reforms and workers' rights.The prime minister's warning that peace could be at risk from an EU exit did not go down well with the Leave side. It was mocked by Boris Johnson, who said it was ""very curious"" that the prime minister had called a referendum on leaving the EU, only to warn us ""that World War III is about to break out unless we vote to remain"".The Leave campaign's constant refrain is that Remain are trying to scare voters into backing their side. They call it Project Fear.The Remain campaign, for its part, have tried to suggest the Leavers are a bunch of swivel-eyed conspiracy theorists.""The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster,"" said George Osborne last week, on a visit to Stansted airport with Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable.There is an old internet maxim, known as Godwin's Law, that states the longer a debate goes on the more likely it is that someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.It was Boris Johnson who proved it correct last week, when he compared the EU's efforts to unify Europe to Hitler's. This was the moment that turned simmering tensions into (apologies for mixing the metaphors) a full-blown firestorm.Lord Heseltine - a longstanding supporter of the EU - suggested that the strain of the campaign must be getting to Boris Johnson, causing him to lose his judgement, blasting Mr Johnson's Hitler article as ""preposterous"" and ""obscene"" and suggesting he is not fit be Tory leader.Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Lord Heseltine as a ""voice from the past"" and fellow Leave campaigner Steve Baker accused Downing Street of being behind ""vicious briefings"" against his side, as he called for an end to ""personal nastiness"".And that is where we are today, with Conservative MPs on all sides appealing for an end to ""blue-on-blue"" conflict as the civil war in their party appears to rage out of control.But at least one Tory Leave campaigner is taking the longer view. Jacob-Rees Mogg,  writing in the Financial Times has drawn parallels with Conservative splits over the Corn Laws in the 19th century.""The Tory party survived great splits when its discipline and structures were much less well founded than they are now. The EU referendum will decide the matter of Europe for a generation - and the party is united in all other important policy areas."""

2016-05-18,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-19,Corbyn outlines 'new economics' vision,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36351149,"Labour will seek to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly, Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he set out his party's plans for the economy.Addressing activists, he called for a ""mixed economy of public and social enterprise... a private sector with a long-term private business commitment"".He said a Labour government would break from the ""failed economic orthodoxy"".Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesOsborne warns Brexit will hit house pricesAt Labour's ""state of the economy"" conference in west London, Mr Corbyn set out his desire to reform capitalism and said his party needed to ""deliver the new economy that this country needs"".""An economy that starts by tackling the grotesque levels of inequality within our society,"" went on Mr Corbyn. ""An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment.""Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  ""Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. ""A new economics.""He said: ""Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared.""By Chris Mason, BBC News political correspondentHaving survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch. Mr Corbyn called it ""a new economics"". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the ""fundamental business of reforming capitalism"".So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.No one can doubt their ambition: ""I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform,"" the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS. But to do that, they have to win the next general election.Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough so they can fight that election? And if they do, can Messrs Corbyn and McDonnell sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money. ""We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances,"" he said. Councils would be given the power to limit ""skyrocketing"" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people ""at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market"".The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.The ""local rent regulation"" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to ""pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords"", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was ""creating a bigger and better private rented sector"". ""These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent,"" she said."

Treasury analysis is due next week. Its report will suggest that two years after a Brexit vote, UK house prices could be between 10% and 18% lower than after a remain vote.""If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like,"" Mr Osborne said.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowG7 finance ministers also think a UK exit would cause a ""shock"" to the world economy.After two-day talks in Japan they said it would complicate the world economy alongside geopolitical conflict, terrorism and the refugee crisis.The International Monetary Fund last Friday also said Brexit could cause a ""sharp drop"" in house prices.But former Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, cast doubt on the chancellor's forecast, saying: ""When I heard that I did think of Pinocchio and the nose growing rather long here.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.He said Mr Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2010 because Treasury reports could not be trusted as ""they were always fiddled with by chancellors of the exchequer"". He also said that the Treasury had failed to predict either the recession or a November fall in tax receipts. ""Now what we have had is a whole series of Treasury reports telling us the world is going to end, we are going to end up with lower house prices, the economy is going to be bad,"" he said. ""Even the Treasury has to admit under their most pessimistic forecast, the British economy would continue to grow after we left the European Union. And, this report also says house prices would continue to grow. ""My point is very simple, they do not know.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonWith four and a bit weeks to go until referendum day, voters find themselves swimming in a murky ocean of questionable statistics. And when I say questionable, I'm being polite.August bodies and grand figures on both sides are making bold claims. And they are both guessing. So what's happening here? Each side is playing what it sees as its greatest hit. The let's stay in brigade talk about the economy. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.The let's get out brigade talk about immigration. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.There will be plenty more claims where these came from before you pick up that stubby little pencil in a draughty polling station.Mr Osborne earlier told the BBC an ""economic shock"" would follow a vote for Britain to leave the EU. ""In the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer,"" he said. ""That affects the value of people's homes. And at the same time, first-time buyers are hit because mortgage rates go up, and mortgages become more difficult to get. So it's a lose-lose situation.""Campaigners for Vote Leave have previously said that lower house prices would help first-time buyers and those in the rental market.Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable tweeted: ""Osborne on house prices. Surely big price fall good for affordability and economic balance. Stick to jobs and basic economics George.""On Thursday, estate agents claimed a Brexit would take about £2,200 off average house prices by 2018.Ratings agency Moody's also said curbing immigration would ease competition for housing, and slow down house price and rental inflation.Also on Saturday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged mothers to vote for the UK to stay in the EU for the sake of their children.He told a conference of left-of-centre think tank the Fabian Society: ""To mothers who are worried about the prospects for their children in the future and want to know where the jobs will come from, to people who feel that globalisation is a runaway train and it's out of control and uncontrollable, we've got to show that we can manage that in the public interest.""

2016-05-19,Staying in EU adds 5m to population - Gove,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36341206,"Staying in the EU could increase the UK's population by up to 5.23m by 2030, Vote Leave has claimed, putting the NHS under ""unsustainable"" pressure.Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the estimates were ""robust"" and voting to leave the EU would strengthen the NHS.He argued the National Living Wage was an extra ""pull factor"" for migrants. Remain campaigners say the 5m figure is ""absurd"" as it is based on five states joining the EU by 2020, which they say ""is not remotely on the cards"".Politics Live: Updates from the EU referendum campaignPrime Minister David Cameron has said it will be ""decades"" before Turkey joins the EU and there is no firm date for the accession of Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia.A document from Vote Leave says the EU's commitment to the free movement of people and the UK's new National Living Wage mean net migration from the EU to the UK will be between 170,000 and 430,000 a year - adding between 2.58m and 5.23m people to the UK population by 2030.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.The group calculates the NHS could have to contend with a new group of patients the size of ""four Birminghams"", and A&E demand could increase by up to 57%. Voting to leave could mean ""millions of pounds saved in ending EU contributions"" could be given to ""strengthen"" the NHS instead, Mr Gove said. ""Boris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear that the NHS will only face additional pressures. ""Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU into UK every year.""But the EU was committed to allowing five new countries to join, he said, whose citizens would ""inevitably"" be attracted to the UK: ""The idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable.""The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Read moreThe Office for National Statistics predicts that net migration to the UK - from countries across the world, not just the EU - will add up to just under three million by 2029.Vote Leave says the ONS has ""consistently underestimated the true level of migration"" in the past and there are ""strong reasons to doubt this forecast"".Mr Gove stood by the Vote Leave figures, describing them as ""robust and methodologically fair"" and denied abandoning the economic argument - which Vote Leave had been focused on at the start of the campaign - to concentrate on immigration. But the Remain campaign said it was ""absurd"" to base figures on five new EU states by 2020 and the UK could veto any new country joining, and apply restrictions on free movement for new EU states.They pointed to comments made by Vote Leave's Boris Johnson to LBC radio in March, when he said Turkey would not join the EU ""in the foreseeable future"" and the idea of 75 million Turks having visa-free travel was ""simply not on the cards"".Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is campaigning the UK to remain in the EU, said: ""I think these figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they're not designed to inform - they're designed to confuse.""And former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said: ""Wrecking the economy by leaving Europe would make our NHS weaker - and patients would pay the price.""These figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU's Single Market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people's wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a £36 billion black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service.""""Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.""Meanwhile European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Le Monde that Britain would have to accept being treated like an outsider if it votes to leave the EU. ""Deserters won't be welcomed with open arms,"" he said.""That is not a threat, but our relations will no longer be as they are today"".But UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker's ""whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels"" adding: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat.""And Vote Leave's Labour chair Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low."""

2016-05-19,Two Britons lose EU vote legal bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36341839,"Two Britons living abroad have lost their Court of Appeal battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.The challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan, 54.Under law, UK citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote. The pair took the case to the Court of Appeal after losing their application for a judicial review last month. Mr Shindler and Ms MacLennan had argued the in-out vote on EU membership, on 23 June, directly affected them and brought the test case on behalf of others in their situation.In April, they asked High Court judges to declare that section two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established ""the 15-year rule"", unlawfully acted as a penalty for their having exercised their rights to free movement.But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.They then took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a one-day hearing took place earlier this month. Three appeal judges - Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King - upheld the High Court decision on Friday, declaring the rule did not unlawfully interfere with the right of expats to freedom of movement within the European Union.EU campaign latestEU vote: All you need to knowUK stars back remaining in EUStudents risk missing voteLord Dyson said: ""The claimants say that their exclusion from the franchise is an unjustified restriction on their EU right - EU law right - of free movement and contrary to their constitutional, common law right to vote. ""The appeals against the dismissal of their claims is dismissed. The court holds first that the 2015 Act does not fall within the scope of EU law at all, so that the claim fails at the first hurdle.""He added that ""the common law right to vote does not take precedence over an Act of Parliament"" and refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The expats still have the right to ask Supreme Court judges to consider the case, however. Their lawyers said a hearing had been listed for Tuesday, at which permission to appeal - as well as the substance of the appeal itself - would be considered.Those eligible can register to vote here.The non-Britons who get an EU voteMs McLennan, who is originally from Inverness but has lived in Brussels since 1987, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The refusal to allow me and others in my situation to vote is an infringement of my EU rights.""She added that the result of the vote ""would have a huge impact"" on both her personal and professional life, and that she often returned to the UK to visit her parents and children, and for work. ""I feel very strongly that I ought to have a fundamental democratic right to vote in my country of citizenship,"" said Ms McLennan.Mr Shindler, appointed an MBE for Anglo-Italian relations in 2014, has been told he has ""diminished or diluted"" links to the UK after living abroad for so long. He has lived in Italy for 35 years. The UK passport holder, originally from London, said: ""The fact that we don't live there doesn't alter that fact, we were born British and we will remain that way. ""If we go and live somewhere else, it doesn't make us anything else. They work out here. People don't know who these expats are you know, think they're all on holiday.""He also said the government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed.Law firm Leigh Day, which represents the pair, argued that up to two million British citizens were being unlawfully denied the right to vote on membership of the EU."
2016-05-19,Care 'could suffer' as NHS busts budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36341235,"Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out. Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"".""We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care.""The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service. There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS ""could not be bleaker"".""The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.""There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.""Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black holeFinancial problems 'endemic in the NHS'Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Nearly nine in 10 hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterTaken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was ""cooking up accounting alchemy"" by ""turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury"". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎""We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff,"" he added.The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published."
2016-05-19,Scores of UK stars back remaining in EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36338220,"Jude Law, Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch are among stars who have signed a letter saying Brexit would ""damage"" the creative industry.Almost 300 actors, musicians, writers and artists are backing calls for the UK to stay in the EU.They say ""vital EU funding"" and work across borders has been key to projects from galleries to blockbusters.But House of Cards author Lord Dobbs said British success in the industry was ""not because of the EU"".Among others backing the letter are actors Bill Nighy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sir John Hurt, Sir Patrick Stewart and Thandie Newton, architect Richard Rogers, artist Tracey Emin, author John le Carre, comedian Jo Brand, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, director Richard Curtis and writer Philip Pullman.The letter, organised by the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, says: ""Britain is not just stronger in Europe, it is more imaginative and more creative, and our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away.""It adds: ""Leaving Europe would be a leap into the unknown for millions of people across the UK who work in the creative industries, and for the millions more at home and abroad who benefit from the growth and vibrancy of Britain's cultural sector.""""We believe that being part of the EU bolsters Britain's leading role on the world stage. Let's not become an outsider shouting from the wings.""The Stronger In campaign says that more than 2.2 million people are employed in the UK's creative industries and digital sector. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.It argues that the creative and digital industries export billions of pounds of services to the EU and are among the fastest-growing sectors of the UK economy.Prime Minister David Cameron met some of the stars campaigning for Remain at a visit to the famous Abbey Road studios in London, with former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell.Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign, said leaving the EU would mean higher tariffs on exports and digital and creative industries were ""better off with the UK in EU"" with access to the single market.But speaking in a personal capacity, the Conservative peer and author Lord Dobbs, said: ""Our creative industries are booming because of the talent that is in Britain's DNA. ""We are world leaders in so many creative areas. From theatre to literature, video games, feature films, fashion, music and so much else, British artists lead the way and are celebrated around the globe. ""It's a success that has been created by the dedication, hard work and extraordinary creative abilities of our artists, it's not because of the EU."" He added: ""Culture owes nothing to committees. ""Ancient Greece was the birthplace of our civilisation yet today, because of the EU's appalling policies, streets that were once filled with the world's greatest philosophers and playwrights are choked with desperate beggars and mountains of rotting rubbish. ""These are the realities of the EU. It's failing. The dream is dead. We need to move on.""Conservative Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he did not think people should be ""swayed by celebrities"".Meanwhile Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has entered the debate, warning that Canada's own trade deal with the EU had taken more than ten years to negotiate and was yet to enter force.""There's nothing easy or automatic about that,"" he said.""Britain is always going to have clout, it's just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU. I believe we're always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn't seem to be a productive path for countries.""The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has defended Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's intervention in the debate last week, when he warned that a vote to leave could cause a recession.Mr Trichet told BBC's This Week's World there was an ""obligation"" for the central bank to ""say candidly what they see"".Those behind the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union said Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the risks of Brexit. Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC he ""wouldn't expect"" a major financial institution to back the Leave campaign ""because they all wanted to protect the status quo"".And Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, has described ""this daily avalanche of institutional propaganda"" as ""ludicrous and pitiful"".

2016-05-19,MP brands voter 'a horrible racist',https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-36334488,"A Labour MP campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU has apologised after being recorded calling a voter a ""horrible racist"".Shadow Europe minister Pat Glass made the comments after an interview with BBC Radio Derby in Sawley, Derbyshire.She said: ""The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.Updates on this story and more from DerbyshireThe man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them. ""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"". ""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this."" Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""But she accused Leave campaigners of offering ""false promises"" that if the UK left the EU there would be a ""substantial"" change on migration policy."
2016-05-19,Cameron heads off EU trade deal revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36332415,"Downing Street has headed off a revolt over the Queen's Speech by saying it will accept a move to exclude the NHS from a controversial EU-US trade deal. Tory rebels were threatening to join Labour and the SNP to back an amendment ""regretting"" the lack of a bill to protect the NHS from the TTIP deal.But Downing Street has denied them the chance by saying they will back it.One of the MPs tabling the amendment, Labour's Paula Sherriff, described it as a ""humiliating climbdown"" by the PM.""They will now be the first government in history to officially 'regret' their own programme within days of announcing it, just months after doing the same on their Budget,"" she said.Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Steve Baker MP said: ""The government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.""But a spokesman for Number 10 said: ""As we've said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this amendment is selected, we'll accept it.""Also on Thursday, David Cameron told LBC radio  he did not want the EU referendum to become a ""Tory psycho-drama"" involving him and senior ""Leave"" Conservatives Boris Johnson and Michael Gove but claimed former London mayor Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a leaver"". He also described himself as a Eurosceptic but said he believed it was better that the UK remain in the EU.Mr Johnson, in response, said he had been a ""Eurosceptic for decades"" and said: ""I urge my friends in government to recognise that in all logic, and as self-declared Eurosceptics, they should really be campaigning with us on this side of the argument.""The TTIP amendment - signed by 25 Tory MPs - expressed regret that the government has not brought forward a bill to protect the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, currently being negotiated between the EU and the US. Although it would have been a purely symbolic vote, no government has suffered a defeat on a Queen's Speech, which sets out its legislative programme for the year ahead, since 1924.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long opposed TTIP, had said he would back the Conservative rebels.It is understood the SNP and other minority parties were also likely to support the amendment.Sources in the Vote Leave campaign predicted the government had faced defeat unless it backed down.Conservative former minister Peter Lilley, who supported the amendment, said that although he supports free trade, TTIP would introduce ""special courts which are not necessary for free trade, will give American multinationals the right to sue our government (but not vice versa) and could put our NHS at risk"".TTIP is primarily a deal to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade between the US and EU countries, making it potentially easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other's markets.Industries it would affect include pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing and food and drink.The government says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars.In the UK, attention has focused on the potential impact on the NHS, with critics saying TTIP would allow private firms running NHS services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector.What is the future for UK-US trade?Labour MP Frank Field, who backed the amendment, said: ""We can't have kangaroo courts, operating only to America's advantage, deciding how we should trade in respect of the NHS.""SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: ""The SNP have been at the forefront of the campaign to protect the NHS and other public services from the potential consequences of TTIP, and so we welcome any opportunity to ensure that the Tory government keep the promises they have already made.""But former Labour minister Rachel Reeves, writing on the Labour List website, said: ""Those who want Britain to leave the EU need to stop preying on British peoples' love for the NHS by cynically pretending that TTIP poses a threat. It does not. ""They are demeaning their own campaign by arguing a case they know to be untrue.""But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who like Ms Reeves is backing the Remain campaign, said she would vote for the amendment.She said: ""If we left the EU, then we could be left with the government negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. What then? ""With the Tories still in charge, we could then expect the roll out of multiple TTIPs on steroids as Britain negotiated trade deals with countries across the world."""
2016-05-19,Lib Dem cabinet post welcomed by Farron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36335307,"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has welcomed Kirsty Williams's plan to be education secretary in an otherwise all Labour Welsh Government.  Mr Farron said she would ""retain her independence"" and aim to make education in Wales ""markedly better"" then in the rest of the UK. Ms Williams's appointment is subject to a vote of Welsh Lib Dem members at a special conference on Saturday.She has said she is not taking party support on the matter for granted.The AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, who boosted her majority over the Conservatives at the assembly election to more than 8,000, was named by First Minister Carwyn Jones on Thursday as part of an eight-member cabinet.Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme on Friday, Mr Farron said Ms Williams's cabinet role would be ""great news for education in Wales"". ""Kirsty has that great strength of somebody with great experience of education, the mother of three children who are in Welsh state schools, and somebody who's very committed to making a difference."" Mr Farron said he was ""very impressed"" with the ""hard achievements"" the Liberal Democrats would get out of the agreement with Labour.""But my aim is, and Kirsty's aim will be, that education in Wales will be markedly better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of Kirsty and the Liberal Democrats' involvement in this administration."" Asked if she was confident of getting her party's support, the former Welsh Lib Dem leader said: ""I never take anything for granted in politics.""The great thing about being a member of the Welsh Liberal Democrats [is that] it's not up to individuals to make these choices. ""Every single member of our party will have an opportunity to have their say and have a vote on this decision.""Ms Williams denied her appointment would effectively mean her party ceased to exist in the assembly.""It exists with a cabinet minister, hopefully subject to the party agreement, being able to implement Welsh Liberal Democrat policies and influencing the agenda,"" she said.""That's a lot stronger than being a single assembly member on a backbench.""Ms Williams said she would never leave her party, and did not think Labour, Plaid and the Welsh Liberal Democrats should merge or have a formal relationship.""There are different traditions and political strands that are represented by each of the parties.""What is important is that we look to work where we can together and recognise that the way in which politics happens in Wales is changing.""It isn't about one single party driving home their manifesto without due reference to other voices.""The deal between Ms Williams and Labour agrees a list of nine common priorities which include pledges from the Welsh Lib Dem election manifesto, such as:It also calls for the upcoming recommendations of the Diamond Review into student finance to be considered ""with a view to early implementation where appropriate"" but with no ""negative effect"" on the higher education budget.The Lib Dem tuition fee policy at the election was to end tuition fee support grants that students currently get. The party proposed to replace it with a student living support grant funded by the other grant's withdrawal - but this is not written into the agreement.Ms Williams was the only opposition AM to back Mr Jones in the first deadlocked vote for first minister - despite Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP supporting Plaid leader Leanne Wood.Mr Jones was later reinstated after he came to an agreement with Plaid Cymru - although no members of that party were appointed to his cabinet.Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said it is unlikely all the policies in the agreement between Ms Williams and Welsh Labour will get support of parties outside the government.He said on Twitter: ""Important to note these policies will need opposition support to be implemented. Unlikely that all will succeed.""The senior Plaid figure also questioned the Lib Dems' pledge in the agreement to reduce infant class sizes to 25.He said that ""most evidence suggests you need to reduce to 15 to have any real effect. Reducing to 25 is costly but ineffective"".Meanwhile UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said Ms Williams should resign her seat and seek a fresh mandate in a by-election.He said: ""When UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless left their old parties, they did the honourable thing and went back to their electors at a by-election to seek a new mandate to represent them.""Kirsty is now duty bound to support Labour 100% over this five-year assembly term. ""I call on her to take the same honourable course and seek a fresh mandate from her constituents because, in all but name, she has now become a Labour AM."" "
2016-05-19,Students risk missing referendum vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36303347,"UK university students believe the EU referendum is key to their future, but almost two-thirds do not know when it is, suggests research. And a third of more than 2,000 students questioned feared being unable to get to their polling station on the day. The referendum, on 23 June, is outside term time, so many students will need to re-register at their home address, says the National Union of Students. NUS vice-president Richard Brooks urged students ""to think ahead"". ""The EU referendum is a once-in-a-generation vote,"" said Mr Brooks. ""The decision made on the 23 June will impact young people and students the most, as they are the ones that will live with the consequences for the longest.""If students don't want their future decided for them, it is essential that as many as possible get out and vote.""Mr Brooks urged students to think about where they would be on referendum day and to make sure they register or re-register at the right address. ""If they are unsure about where they will be, students can register at both their term-time and home address, providing they only vote once,"" he said.""If they are going to be on holiday or are heading to Glastonbury, they should apply for a postal vote.""People had until 17:00 on 7 June to register if they wanted to vote in the referendum, he added. It is also possible to apply for a postal or proxy vote by 17:00 on 8 June. The interviews, carried out this month on a representative sample of students from across the UK by YouthSight for Universities UK, found: Universities UK and the Association of Colleges are holding voter registration drives at institutions across the UK. Students will be advised to register, re-register or apply for proxy or postal votes, according to their circumstances. UUK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said it was of ""real concern"" that so many students were unaware of the referendum date and that they might have to re-register to vote at another address. ""From this week, universities will be scaling up their efforts to encourage students to register to vote, and to make sure they do so in the right location,"" she said.""With nearly two million UK students eligible to vote in the referendum, it is vital that they have all the necessary information to make sure they can take part in this hugely important decision."""

A Downing Street spokesman said ""we don't accept"" Mr Baker's claims. In other EU referendum campaign developments:The government is campaigning for a vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum and Prime Minister David Cameron, whose party is divided on the issue, has previously called for a ""respectful"" debate. But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate ""breathtakingly disheartening"".Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in ""Downing Street hostage videos"".Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended ""into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people"".He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as ""economically illiterate"" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his ""preposterous, obscene"" remarks.""I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,"" said Mr Baker.Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as ""from the past"" following his intervention.Mr Baker claimed there had been ""intolerable media smears"" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: ""It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.""He added: ""If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign ""can't make an honest and positive case"" because they ""know it's a losing argument"".""So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,"" he said. He added: ""What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't accept Steve Baker's article.""All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.""The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: ""Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.""In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based ""employees worse off"".Writing in The Times, he warned financial jobs could leave London for Paris or Frankfurt and said ""a vote to leave is a risk""."

2016-05-19,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"The referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union, or remain a member, is on 23 June. So far, opinion polls suggest the campaign has had little impact on voters. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes assesses what the polls may be telling us.Read the full methodologyThere's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months. The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters. That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention. Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote. ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-19,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post.

This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-19,Resident rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36316467,"It might seem peculiar that a young Australian here in Britain on a two-year working holiday is allowed to have a say on whether the UK should leave the European Union. But Michael Ingle, a 27-year-old physiotherapist living in Surrey, defends his right to participate in the 23 June referendum.He says that as a taxpayer, and a citizen of the Commonwealth, what happens to Britain is important to him and will have ramifications for the wider world well beyond the cliffs of Dover.""It's not just about Britain for me, which is why I've taken an interest in it,"" Mr Ingle, from Sydney, says.""It's about the West and the stability of this continent.""As a hangover from the days of empire, when so-called ""British subjects"" were included in the parliamentary franchise, Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK without British nationality retain the right to vote in elections.Estimates based on the 2011 census put the number of Commonwealth citizens eligible to vote in the forthcoming referendum at between 894,000 and more than 960,000.They join Irish citizens as the only non-Brits allowed to vote in what David Cameron has called a ""once in a generation"" decision. This has drawn the ire of groups including Migration Watch UK.Its chair, Lord Green of Deddington, says that ""important decisions about Britain should be taken by those who are British citizens and only by them"".A petition to parliament signed by more than 40,000 people, meanwhile, has claimed that allowing non-Brits to vote would bias the result towards the Remain side, especially given that the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta are also in the EU.But regardless of whether one agrees with the voting rules, such claims treat Commonwealth voters as a homogenous bloc of sorts, destined to vote in the same way.This obscures the fact that Commonwealth citizens living in Britain come from a diverse range of 53 countries in all the world's time zones.Voters of even the same age and nationality can have vastly different views on the subject at hand.Take Farhan Samsudin and Zila Fawzi, two young Malaysian women living in London.Farhan, who works in banking, says she will vote Remain on 23 June, despite what she says is the failure of either campaign to provide information on how the ""Commonwealth constituency"" might be affected by the result.She thinks the UK should strengthen its economic ties with Asian economies like Malaysia and sees membership of the EU as an obstacle in trade negotiations.Yet, with no clear plans presented to her on how a post-EU Britain would approach the world, she says she'll vote to stay.Zila, on the other hand, who is on a British government-funded scholarship, supports an EU exit.Her vote will be pinned on hopes that immigration policy will change in a way that benefits Commonwealth citizens if the UK no longer has to abide by free movement within the EU.""Once they are out of the EU it would be easier, especially for us Malaysians, to come and work here,"" she says.A postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, Zila is frustrated by the fact that any EU citizen is allowed to work in the UK, while highly educated Commonwealth citizens like her are turned away.On this point, Farhan chimes in.""The British government sponsors brilliant minds like her but they don't give any leeway for her to work here,"" she says, shaking her head. ""It's a real waste.""Avenues for Commonwealth citizens to migrate to the UK have become increasingly slim since the abolishment of working holiday visas (now limited to just a handful of countries under the Youth Mobility Scheme) and the post-study work visa, which allowed students to stay on for two years after the end of their course.Foreign students from outside the EU, many of whom are from the Commonwealth, now have just four months to find a job if they want to stay.The recent introduction of a £35,000 income threshold for non-EU skilled workers to settle in the UK in a bid to reduce net migration has led to further frustration and the spectre of mass deportations.Yet, while it would seem as though pro-Brexit campaigners could capitalise on the prickly issue of immigration in order to draw Commonwealth voters to their side, the issue is not so clear-cut.Given that some of the constituencies that the Leave campaign are courting harbour anti-immigrant sentiment, making a pitch to Commonwealth voters to back an EU exit based on immigration potential could see it take a hit elsewhere, says Ralph Buckle, director of the Commonwealth Exchange think tank.""Everyone has this number of what they think the right level of immigration is. It depends whether that number is high enough to include an increase [from] the Commonwealth.""The government's target of getting net migration under 100,000 annually also hovers ominously over any suggestion that more places could go to Commonwealth citizens if Brexit eventuated.The official Vote Leave campaign has said Britain could have a ""fairer"" migration policy that would ""make it easier for some to come, such as scientists and job-creators"" if the UK left the EU.In February Vote Leave published a letter to David Cameron from community and business leaders with Commonwealth links criticising immigration policy.""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom,"" they said.But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, speaking for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said that leaving the EU in order to end free movement would hurt everyone in Britain economically, including Commonwealth citizens.""Commonwealth citizens living in the UK benefit from jobs, lower prices and financial security we get from being part of the world's largest single market.""Commonwealth countries around the world, from Australia to Jamaica, are urging us to stay in the EU,"" he said.In a newspaper article last August, Lord Howell, chairman of Commonwealth Exchange and a former Conservative minister, said the polarity of the EU question was ""maddeningly oversimplified"" for internationally-minded Commonwealth citizens.He said the Leave campaign could not fall back on a ""little England mantra"", while the Remain camp would have to move away from ""seeing the continent as the UK's only future"".Mark Sultana, a 48-year-old long-time UK resident who organises events for fellow Canadians living in London, sees both sides of the picture.While he bemoans ""all the wastage and all the subsidies"" of the EU, he fears financial instability and losing the right to retire on the continent.""The whole thing is so complicated,"" he says.""I think ultimately even though I'm so anti all these things, so many things that the EU stands for… from the point of view of economic stability, the fact you're in it and that the world should be [becoming] a smaller place not a bigger place… [I would vote with] a grudging and qualified yes.""Mark also points out that the immigration argument means different things for different Commonwealth citizens.Canadians who live in the UK by virtue of European ancestry like himself, for example, might be fearful of losing that right in the case of a Brexit.""For that generation of that ilk, who came here, the European Union is very important. If you have Brexit there's a whole lot of people who would have trouble coming here.""For Brad Argent, meanwhile, having to deal with UK visa hassles despite being married to an English woman makes him feel like ""a second-class citizen"".The 50-year-old Australian, who works for an internet business, needs to wait for five years to get residency.""Whereas if I'm from Europe I can just come over on the train and set up house,"" he says outside Australia's High Commission on the Strand in London, where he has come to renew his passport.But Brad won't carry his these grievances to the ballot box, least of all because he does not want his British children to lose the right to work in the continent.""I think a vote to leave just out of spite because I'm a member of the Commonwealth, whilst that might feel good for about five minutes, I think the longer term implications I would start to regret,"" he says.With Commonwealth migrants unlikely to vote as a uniform bloc due to their divergent interests and circumstances, it appears either camp could still make a pitch to this 'constituency', which has largely been ignored in the debate thus far.After all, a million votes are at stake."
2016-05-19,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36345081,"The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Justice Secretary Michael Gove has unveiled Vote Leave's research on the effect free movement will have on the National Health Service.The document makes broad predictions, but even so, some of the assumptions it makes are questionable.The lower end of the forecast, that EU migration will rise by 2.58 million by 2030, is based on taking the most recent ONS net migration figure and multiplying it by 15.But the ONS actually produces a forecast for total net migration by 2029 (so not just from the EU), which it expects to have added 3 million to the population by then.Now there are uncertainties surrounding all forecasts, but it makes the bottom end of Vote Leave's forecast look somewhat high by comparison.To get to the higher ends of the forecast, the research assumes that all five current candidate countries wanting to join the EU (Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and FYR Macedonia) do so in 2020. This is very unlikely to happen. You can read more about why Turkey in particular is not going to join the EU by 2020 here. They also assume no transitional controls to limit migration from the new members. Existing states are allowed to impose seven years of restrictions to freedom of movement from new members, as the UK did with Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.Add to that the impact of the new National Living Wage and you get to Vote Leave's ""high"" forecast of 5.23 million. The quote from Michael Gove above is supposed to illustrate the ""medium"" forecast, which excludes the effect of the National Living Wage to get to a figure of 4.25 million. The population of Birmingham is about 1.1 million.It is hard to completely discount any forecast. Even so, the line about four Birminghams is hard to justify based on these such assumptions.From the figures on the growing population, the research gets to a figure on the extra demand from A&E departments, concluding that it would lead to an increase in demand of between 28% and 57%.It has reached these figures by looking at increases in A&E attendance since 2002 and noting a strong correlation with cumulative net migration over that time. In other words, attendances to A&E went up quickly at a time when there was continuous net migration to the UK.This relationship is then used to predict how future migration would affect demand for A&E.The problem is that while demand for A&E has gone up at the same time as there has been migration, the research has not demonstrated that one has caused the other.While it is clearly true that higher numbers of migrants would mean more A&E visits, it could be that A&E attendances have gone up for other reasons as well, so the relationship is not reliable.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-19,House of Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36330992,"It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that ""my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons"", she was signalling a retreat. Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers. A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits. Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention -  an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation. Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions. Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.Government to review Lords powers after tax credits defeatLimiting Lords powers 'calls its future into question'It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords.

Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation. My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight. 650Members of Parliament330 Conservative 229 Labour 54 SNP 8 Liberal Democrat ""There's no point in us existing,"" he told me, ""if we don't vote for the things we believe in.""That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened. In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems;  in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247. Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election. ""The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords,"" he says.Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place. ""It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is,"" says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a ""spurious"" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time. He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake. The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.""We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event,"" he said.David Cameron's real problem isn't peers, Lib Dem or otherwise. It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled. Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government. It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem. "
2016-05-19,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36333410,"The claim: Iain Duncan Smith says that more than three quarters of the rise in employment in the last year has come from people born abroad.Reality Check verdict: The latest figures support this. You could also look at the number of non-UK nationals (rather than everyone born abroad, which includes British citizens). They account for 56% of the rise.Responding to the latest unemployment figures, Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: ""Our labour market is thriving, but it's notable that more than three quarters of the rise in employment over the last year has come from people born abroad.""The figures suggest that people born abroad account for 80% of the rise in employment - as Mr Duncan Smith says, more than three quarters. But the figure for the number of people born abroad includes UK nationals who were born in other countries.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces figures for non-UK nationals working in the UK, which suggests 56% of the increase in employment may be attributed to non-UK nationals.In the context of the referendum the broader point the Leave Campaign has been making is that there's been a big increase in the proportion of people working in the UK who are EU nationals.The proportion of UK workers who are non-UK EU nationals has indeed increased considerably. In the first three months of this year, about 6.8% of UK workers were non-UK EU nationals. Five years ago that figure was 4.5% and 10 years ago it was 2.6%. If you look at the numbers behind that, at the moment there are 2.15 million EU nationals working in the UK. Five years ago it was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-19,War of words,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36304729,"The EU referendum debate is rapidly turning into a festival of name-calling and insults. How did we get here?It all started out so well. David Cameron decided to allow members of his cabinet to campaign for either side in the EU referendum. Some argue he had no choice, given the likelihood of resignations. Others wondered how it would work, with big personalities like Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith having public disagreements with Mr Cameron and George Osborne one minute and then calmly putting aside their differences the next to get on with running the country. But both sides insisted they could be grown up about it.  ""We should all be big enough to have an honest and open, but polite disagreement, and then come back together again afterwards,"" said Mr Cameron.Announcing his decision to join the Leave campaign in February, Boris Johnson praised the PM's renegotiation attempts, and urged his divided Conservative colleagues to ""play the ball and not the man"". There was plenty of ill-feeling flying around before the debate proper got under way, with a bitter and personal row between the two rival Leave campaigns and mutterings from Eurosceptic backbenchers about how little they thought Mr Cameron had achieved in his renegotiations.But the big beasts managed to keep it relatively civil, with personal attacks couched in the coded language of Westminster. David Cameron's comments in the Commons, shortly after Boris Johnson joined the Leave camp, about having ""no other agenda than what is best for our country"" was interpreted as a jibe at the former London mayor's leadership ambitions. It was written up in the press as a ""war"" between the two men. Iain Duncan Smith may have resigned from the Cabinet over cuts to disability benefits in March's Budget - but it gave him freedom to say what he really thinks about David Cameron and George Osborne and their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. And he has not held back. He has been scathing about Mr Cameron's renegotiations, claiming he achieved ""nothing"", and has accused the Remain campaign of ""spin, smears and threats"" to try to ""bully"" Britons into voting to stay. He has also appealed for calm, warning that all the rows risk long-term damage to the Conservative Party.What has enraged the Leave camp, possibly more than anything else, is the way in which they think the prime minister has used the might of the government machine to rig the referendum debate in his favour. The government's decision, in April, to spend £9m on sending a glossy brochure to every household in the country led to loud cries of foul play. David Cameron said the government was entitled to state its case. But Boris Johnson claimed the PM had reneged on his promise to ""fight fair"" during the referendum because he was ""losing the argument"". The Treasury's analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit provoked an even more furious reaction from the Leavers, particularly when George Osborne accused them of being ""economically illiterate"". The former Mayor of London has been on vintage form during this campaign, dreaming up ever more inventive ways of trashing the Remain campaign, headed by his old friend and rival David Cameron.He has compared them to jeweller Gerald Ratner, who famously called his own products ""crap"". He has described the global leaders backing the Remain campaign as appearing in Downing Street ""hostage videos"".A visit to an underwear factory in Derbyshire proved to be a target rich environment for the ex-Mayor.He compared the EU to a ""badly designed undergarment"", shouted ""pants on fire"" at the Remain campaign, before unleashing the inevitable battle cry:  ""Knickers to all those who talk Britain down.""David Cameron has largely avoided slinging mud back at Boris, but another Old Etonian Conservative MP has stepped manfully into the breach. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill and ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, is not a fan of the former London mayor, it seems.When Mr Johnson penned an article referencing Barack Obama's ""part Kenyan"" ancestry, Sir Nicholas had this to say on LBC radio:  ""I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive.""Sir Nicholas has kept up the Boris-baiting on his Twitter account, calling him the ""unchallenged master of the self inflicted wound"" and branding his comments about Hitler and the EU ""absurd, desperate and outright offensive"".With Labour MPs and members overwhelmingly supportive of the Remain campaign, ""red on red"" attacks have been less frequent than the ""blue on blue"" variety.  But Jeremy Corbyn's previous Eurosceptic sentiments have not gone unnoticed by the Labour Leave campaign. Labour MP Kate Hoey suggested the Labour leader (motto ""straight talking, honest politics"") was being less than straight with his decision to embrace the Remain cause.She said Labour voters would ""see through"" him. ""We know first of all, that he doesn't really mean it, no matter how much he tries to pretend he does, and secondly, that it is not in the interest of the Labour movement,"" she told the BBC News channel.Mr Corbyn says he wants to stay in the EU to fight for social reforms and workers' rights.The prime minister's warning that peace could be at risk from an EU exit did not go down well with the Leave side. It was mocked by Boris Johnson, who said it was ""very curious"" that the prime minister had called a referendum on leaving the EU, only to warn us ""that World War III is about to break out unless we vote to remain"".The Leave campaign's constant refrain is that Remain are trying to scare voters into backing their side. They call it Project Fear.The Remain campaign, for its part, have tried to suggest the Leavers are a bunch of swivel-eyed conspiracy theorists.""The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster,"" said George Osborne last week, on a visit to Stansted airport with Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable.There is an old internet maxim, known as Godwin's Law, that states the longer a debate goes on the more likely it is that someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.It was Boris Johnson who proved it correct last week, when he compared the EU's efforts to unify Europe to Hitler's. This was the moment that turned simmering tensions into (apologies for mixing the metaphors) a full-blown firestorm.Lord Heseltine - a longstanding supporter of the EU - suggested that the strain of the campaign must be getting to Boris Johnson, causing him to lose his judgement, blasting Mr Johnson's Hitler article as ""preposterous"" and ""obscene"" and suggesting he is not fit be Tory leader.Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Lord Heseltine as a ""voice from the past"" and fellow Leave campaigner Steve Baker accused Downing Street of being behind ""vicious briefings"" against his side, as he called for an end to ""personal nastiness"".And that is where we are today, with Conservative MPs on all sides appealing for an end to ""blue-on-blue"" conflict as the civil war in their party appears to rage out of control.But at least one Tory Leave campaigner is taking the longer view. Jacob-Rees Mogg,  writing in the Financial Times has drawn parallels with Conservative splits over the Corn Laws in the 19th century.""The Tory party survived great splits when its discipline and structures were much less well founded than they are now. The EU referendum will decide the matter of Europe for a generation - and the party is united in all other important policy areas."""

2016-05-19,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government.

The Wentworth and Dearne held a range of post during the Labour government, including financial secretary to the Treasury and local government minister.Shadow attorney general - Karl TurnerThe MP for Hull East took over the role of Labour's chief legal adviser after the resignation of Catherine McKinnell.

Mr Corbyn called it ""a new economics"". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the ""fundamental business of reforming capitalism"".So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.No one can doubt their ambition: ""I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform,"" the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS. But to do that, they have to win the next general election.Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough so they can fight that election? And if they do, can Messrs Corbyn and McDonnell sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money. ""We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances,"" he said. Councils would be given the power to limit ""skyrocketing"" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people ""at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market"".The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.The ""local rent regulation"" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to ""pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords"", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was ""creating a bigger and better private rented sector"". ""These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent,"" she said."

2016-05-20,Osborne 'Pinocchio' on Brexit forecast,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36351310,"Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has compared George Osborne to ""Pinocchio"" over his claim that a vote to leave the EU would cause an economic shock to UK house prices.The chancellor earlier said that in the event of a vote for Brexit, by 2018, houses could be worth up to 18% less than if the UK voted to remain.But Mr Duncan Smith said the claim reminded him of ""the nose growing rather long"". Treasury analysis is due next week. Its report will suggest that two years after a Brexit vote, UK house prices could be between 10% and 18% lower than after a remain vote.""If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like,"" Mr Osborne said.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowG7 finance ministers also think a UK exit would cause a ""shock"" to the world economy.After two-day talks in Japan they said it would complicate the world economy alongside geopolitical conflict, terrorism and the refugee crisis.The International Monetary Fund last Friday also said Brexit could cause a ""sharp drop"" in house prices.But former Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, cast doubt on the chancellor's forecast, saying: ""When I heard that I did think of Pinocchio and the nose growing rather long here.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.He said Mr Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2010 because Treasury reports could not be trusted as ""they were always fiddled with by chancellors of the exchequer"". He also said that the Treasury had failed to predict either the recession or a November fall in tax receipts. ""Now what we have had is a whole series of Treasury reports telling us the world is going to end, we are going to end up with lower house prices, the economy is going to be bad,"" he said. ""Even the Treasury has to admit under their most pessimistic forecast, the British economy would continue to grow after we left the European Union. And, this report also says house prices would continue to grow. ""My point is very simple, they do not know.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonWith four and a bit weeks to go until referendum day, voters find themselves swimming in a murky ocean of questionable statistics. And when I say questionable, I'm being polite.August bodies and grand figures on both sides are making bold claims. And they are both guessing. So what's happening here? Each side is playing what it sees as its greatest hit. The let's stay in brigade talk about the economy. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.The let's get out brigade talk about immigration. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.There will be plenty more claims where these came from before you pick up that stubby little pencil in a draughty polling station.Mr Osborne earlier told the BBC an ""economic shock"" would follow a vote for Britain to leave the EU. ""In the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer,"" he said. ""That affects the value of people's homes. And at the same time, first-time buyers are hit because mortgage rates go up, and mortgages become more difficult to get. So it's a lose-lose situation.""Campaigners for Vote Leave have previously said that lower house prices would help first-time buyers and those in the rental market.Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable tweeted: ""Osborne on house prices. Surely big price fall good for affordability and economic balance. Stick to jobs and basic economics George.""On Thursday, estate agents claimed a Brexit would take about £2,200 off average house prices by 2018.Ratings agency Moody's also said curbing immigration would ease competition for housing, and slow down house price and rental inflation.Also on Saturday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged mothers to vote for the UK to stay in the EU for the sake of their children.He told a conference of left-of-centre think tank the Fabian Society: ""To mothers who are worried about the prospects for their children in the future and want to know where the jobs will come from, to people who feel that globalisation is a runaway train and it's out of control and uncontrollable, we've got to show that we can manage that in the public interest.""

2016-05-20,Staying in EU adds 5m to population - Gove,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36341206,"Staying in the EU could increase the UK's population by up to 5.23m by 2030, Vote Leave has claimed, putting the NHS under ""unsustainable"" pressure.Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the estimates were ""robust"" and voting to leave the EU would strengthen the NHS.He argued the National Living Wage was an extra ""pull factor"" for migrants. Remain campaigners say the 5m figure is ""absurd"" as it is based on five states joining the EU by 2020, which they say ""is not remotely on the cards"".Politics Live: Updates from the EU referendum campaignPrime Minister David Cameron has said it will be ""decades"" before Turkey joins the EU and there is no firm date for the accession of Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia.A document from Vote Leave says the EU's commitment to the free movement of people and the UK's new National Living Wage mean net migration from the EU to the UK will be between 170,000 and 430,000 a year - adding between 2.58m and 5.23m people to the UK population by 2030.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.The group calculates the NHS could have to contend with a new group of patients the size of ""four Birminghams"", and A&E demand could increase by up to 57%. Voting to leave could mean ""millions of pounds saved in ending EU contributions"" could be given to ""strengthen"" the NHS instead, Mr Gove said. ""Boris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear that the NHS will only face additional pressures. ""Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU into UK every year.""But the EU was committed to allowing five new countries to join, he said, whose citizens would ""inevitably"" be attracted to the UK: ""The idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable.""The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Read moreThe Office for National Statistics predicts that net migration to the UK - from countries across the world, not just the EU - will add up to just under three million by 2029.Vote Leave says the ONS has ""consistently underestimated the true level of migration"" in the past and there are ""strong reasons to doubt this forecast"".Mr Gove stood by the Vote Leave figures, describing them as ""robust and methodologically fair"" and denied abandoning the economic argument - which Vote Leave had been focused on at the start of the campaign - to concentrate on immigration. But the Remain campaign said it was ""absurd"" to base figures on five new EU states by 2020 and the UK could veto any new country joining, and apply restrictions on free movement for new EU states.They pointed to comments made by Vote Leave's Boris Johnson to LBC radio in March, when he said Turkey would not join the EU ""in the foreseeable future"" and the idea of 75 million Turks having visa-free travel was ""simply not on the cards"".Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is campaigning the UK to remain in the EU, said: ""I think these figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they're not designed to inform - they're designed to confuse.""And former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said: ""Wrecking the economy by leaving Europe would make our NHS weaker - and patients would pay the price.""These figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU's Single Market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people's wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a £36 billion black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service.""""Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.""Meanwhile European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Le Monde that Britain would have to accept being treated like an outsider if it votes to leave the EU. ""Deserters won't be welcomed with open arms,"" he said.""That is not a threat, but our relations will no longer be as they are today"".But UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker's ""whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels"" adding: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat.""And Vote Leave's Labour chair Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low."""

Last year Mr Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidential election, said many Muslims nursed a ""hatred"" towards America and a ban should be in force ""until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"". By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editorWhile it is true that hopefuls like Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio met the prime-minister when they were passing through London - that was before they had declared they were candidates for the Republican nomination. A senior source said the PM would be happy to see Mr Trump once he becomes the official nominee - that will happen after the Republican Convention in July. Four years ago the then Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, visited Downing Street - and caused consternation when he criticised Britain's preparedness for hosting the London 2012 Olympics. Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: ""I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him.""Downing Street has since said the PM stands by his criticism of but will work with whoever is elected US president.Donald Trump's reality TV playbookKissing Kissinger and other Trump pivotsNevada chaos should worry DemocratsIn an interview with US news channel MSNBC, Mr Trump said: ""I will do just fine with David Cameron.

2016-05-20,Two Britons lose EU vote legal bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36341839,"Two Britons living abroad have lost their Court of Appeal battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.The challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan, 54.Under law, UK citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote. The pair took the case to the Court of Appeal after losing their application for a judicial review last month. Mr Shindler and Ms MacLennan had argued the in-out vote on EU membership, on 23 June, directly affected them and brought the test case on behalf of others in their situation.In April, they asked High Court judges to declare that section two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established ""the 15-year rule"", unlawfully acted as a penalty for their having exercised their rights to free movement.But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.They then took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a one-day hearing took place earlier this month. Three appeal judges - Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King - upheld the High Court decision on Friday, declaring the rule did not unlawfully interfere with the right of expats to freedom of movement within the European Union.EU campaign latestEU vote: All you need to knowUK stars back remaining in EUStudents risk missing voteLord Dyson said: ""The claimants say that their exclusion from the franchise is an unjustified restriction on their EU right - EU law right - of free movement and contrary to their constitutional, common law right to vote. ""The appeals against the dismissal of their claims is dismissed. The court holds first that the 2015 Act does not fall within the scope of EU law at all, so that the claim fails at the first hurdle.""He added that ""the common law right to vote does not take precedence over an Act of Parliament"" and refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The expats still have the right to ask Supreme Court judges to consider the case, however. Their lawyers said a hearing had been listed for Tuesday, at which permission to appeal - as well as the substance of the appeal itself - would be considered.Those eligible can register to vote here.The non-Britons who get an EU voteMs McLennan, who is originally from Inverness but has lived in Brussels since 1987, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The refusal to allow me and others in my situation to vote is an infringement of my EU rights.""She added that the result of the vote ""would have a huge impact"" on both her personal and professional life, and that she often returned to the UK to visit her parents and children, and for work. ""I feel very strongly that I ought to have a fundamental democratic right to vote in my country of citizenship,"" said Ms McLennan.Mr Shindler, appointed an MBE for Anglo-Italian relations in 2014, has been told he has ""diminished or diluted"" links to the UK after living abroad for so long. He has lived in Italy for 35 years. The UK passport holder, originally from London, said: ""The fact that we don't live there doesn't alter that fact, we were born British and we will remain that way. ""If we go and live somewhere else, it doesn't make us anything else. They work out here. People don't know who these expats are you know, think they're all on holiday.""He also said the government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed.Law firm Leigh Day, which represents the pair, argued that up to two million British citizens were being unlawfully denied the right to vote on membership of the EU."
2016-05-20,Care 'could suffer' as NHS busts budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36341235,"Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out. Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"".""We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care.""The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service. There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS ""could not be bleaker"".""The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.""There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.""Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black holeFinancial problems 'endemic in the NHS'Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Nearly nine in 10 hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterTaken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was ""cooking up accounting alchemy"" by ""turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury"". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎""We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff,"" he added.The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published."

I believe we're always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn't seem to be a productive path for countries.""The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has defended Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's intervention in the debate last week, when he warned that a vote to leave could cause a recession.Mr Trichet told BBC's This Week's World there was an ""obligation"" for the central bank to ""say candidly what they see"".Those behind the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union said Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the risks of Brexit. Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC he ""wouldn't expect"" a major financial institution to back the Leave campaign ""because they all wanted to protect the status quo"".And Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, has described ""this daily avalanche of institutional propaganda"" as ""ludicrous and pitiful"".

I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.Updates on this story and more from DerbyshireThe man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them. ""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"". ""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this."" Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""But she accused Leave campaigners of offering ""false promises"" that if the UK left the EU there would be a ""substantial"" change on migration policy."

Tory rebels were threatening to join Labour and the SNP to back an amendment ""regretting"" the lack of a bill to protect the NHS from the TTIP deal.But Downing Street has denied them the chance by saying they will back it.One of the MPs tabling the amendment, Labour's Paula Sherriff, described it as a ""humiliating climbdown"" by the PM.""They will now be the first government in history to officially 'regret' their own programme within days of announcing it, just months after doing the same on their Budget,"" she said.Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Steve Baker MP said: ""The government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.""But a spokesman for Number 10 said: ""As we've said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this amendment is selected, we'll accept it.""Also on Thursday, David Cameron told LBC radio  he did not want the EU referendum to become a ""Tory psycho-drama"" involving him and senior ""Leave"" Conservatives Boris Johnson and Michael Gove but claimed former London mayor Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a leaver"". He also described himself as a Eurosceptic but said he believed it was better that the UK remain in the EU.Mr Johnson, in response, said he had been a ""Eurosceptic for decades"" and said: ""I urge my friends in government to recognise that in all logic, and as self-declared Eurosceptics, they should really be campaigning with us on this side of the argument.""The TTIP amendment - signed by 25 Tory MPs - expressed regret that the government has not brought forward a bill to protect the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, currently being negotiated between the EU and the US. Although it would have been a purely symbolic vote, no government has suffered a defeat on a Queen's Speech, which sets out its legislative programme for the year ahead, since 1924.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long opposed TTIP, had said he would back the Conservative rebels.It is understood the SNP and other minority parties were also likely to support the amendment.Sources in the Vote Leave campaign predicted the government had faced defeat unless it backed down.Conservative former minister Peter Lilley, who supported the amendment, said that although he supports free trade, TTIP would introduce ""special courts which are not necessary for free trade, will give American multinationals the right to sue our government (but not vice versa) and could put our NHS at risk"".TTIP is primarily a deal to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade between the US and EU countries, making it potentially easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other's markets.Industries it would affect include pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing and food and drink.The government says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars.In the UK, attention has focused on the potential impact on the NHS, with critics saying TTIP would allow private firms running NHS services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector.What is the future for UK-US trade?Labour MP Frank Field, who backed the amendment, said: ""We can't have kangaroo courts, operating only to America's advantage, deciding how we should trade in respect of the NHS.""SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: ""The SNP have been at the forefront of the campaign to protect the NHS and other public services from the potential consequences of TTIP, and so we welcome any opportunity to ensure that the Tory government keep the promises they have already made.""But former Labour minister Rachel Reeves, writing on the Labour List website, said: ""Those who want Britain to leave the EU need to stop preying on British peoples' love for the NHS by cynically pretending that TTIP poses a threat. It does not. ""They are demeaning their own campaign by arguing a case they know to be untrue.""But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who like Ms Reeves is backing the Remain campaign, said she would vote for the amendment.She said: ""If we left the EU, then we could be left with the government negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. What then? ""With the Tories still in charge, we could then expect the roll out of multiple TTIPs on steroids as Britain negotiated trade deals with countries across the world."""
2016-05-20,Lib Dem cabinet post welcomed by Farron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36335307,"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has welcomed Kirsty Williams's plan to be education secretary in an otherwise all Labour Welsh Government.  Mr Farron said she would ""retain her independence"" and aim to make education in Wales ""markedly better"" then in the rest of the UK. Ms Williams's appointment is subject to a vote of Welsh Lib Dem members at a special conference on Saturday.She has said she is not taking party support on the matter for granted.The AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, who boosted her majority over the Conservatives at the assembly election to more than 8,000, was named by First Minister Carwyn Jones on Thursday as part of an eight-member cabinet.Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme on Friday, Mr Farron said Ms Williams's cabinet role would be ""great news for education in Wales"". ""Kirsty has that great strength of somebody with great experience of education, the mother of three children who are in Welsh state schools, and somebody who's very committed to making a difference."" Mr Farron said he was ""very impressed"" with the ""hard achievements"" the Liberal Democrats would get out of the agreement with Labour.""But my aim is, and Kirsty's aim will be, that education in Wales will be markedly better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of Kirsty and the Liberal Democrats' involvement in this administration."" Asked if she was confident of getting her party's support, the former Welsh Lib Dem leader said: ""I never take anything for granted in politics.""The great thing about being a member of the Welsh Liberal Democrats [is that] it's not up to individuals to make these choices. ""Every single member of our party will have an opportunity to have their say and have a vote on this decision.""Ms Williams denied her appointment would effectively mean her party ceased to exist in the assembly.""It exists with a cabinet minister, hopefully subject to the party agreement, being able to implement Welsh Liberal Democrat policies and influencing the agenda,"" she said.""That's a lot stronger than being a single assembly member on a backbench.""Ms Williams said she would never leave her party, and did not think Labour, Plaid and the Welsh Liberal Democrats should merge or have a formal relationship.""There are different traditions and political strands that are represented by each of the parties.""What is important is that we look to work where we can together and recognise that the way in which politics happens in Wales is changing.""It isn't about one single party driving home their manifesto without due reference to other voices.""The deal between Ms Williams and Labour agrees a list of nine common priorities which include pledges from the Welsh Lib Dem election manifesto, such as:It also calls for the upcoming recommendations of the Diamond Review into student finance to be considered ""with a view to early implementation where appropriate"" but with no ""negative effect"" on the higher education budget.The Lib Dem tuition fee policy at the election was to end tuition fee support grants that students currently get. The party proposed to replace it with a student living support grant funded by the other grant's withdrawal - but this is not written into the agreement.Ms Williams was the only opposition AM to back Mr Jones in the first deadlocked vote for first minister - despite Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP supporting Plaid leader Leanne Wood.Mr Jones was later reinstated after he came to an agreement with Plaid Cymru - although no members of that party were appointed to his cabinet.Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said it is unlikely all the policies in the agreement between Ms Williams and Welsh Labour will get support of parties outside the government.He said on Twitter: ""Important to note these policies will need opposition support to be implemented. Unlikely that all will succeed.""The senior Plaid figure also questioned the Lib Dems' pledge in the agreement to reduce infant class sizes to 25.He said that ""most evidence suggests you need to reduce to 15 to have any real effect. Reducing to 25 is costly but ineffective"".Meanwhile UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said Ms Williams should resign her seat and seek a fresh mandate in a by-election.He said: ""When UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless left their old parties, they did the honourable thing and went back to their electors at a by-election to seek a new mandate to represent them.""Kirsty is now duty bound to support Labour 100% over this five-year assembly term. ""I call on her to take the same honourable course and seek a fresh mandate from her constituents because, in all but name, she has now become a Labour AM."" "
2016-05-20,Students risk missing referendum vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36303347,"UK university students believe the EU referendum is key to their future, but almost two-thirds do not know when it is, suggests research. And a third of more than 2,000 students questioned feared being unable to get to their polling station on the day. The referendum, on 23 June, is outside term time, so many students will need to re-register at their home address, says the National Union of Students. NUS vice-president Richard Brooks urged students ""to think ahead"". ""The EU referendum is a once-in-a-generation vote,"" said Mr Brooks. ""The decision made on the 23 June will impact young people and students the most, as they are the ones that will live with the consequences for the longest.""If students don't want their future decided for them, it is essential that as many as possible get out and vote.""Mr Brooks urged students to think about where they would be on referendum day and to make sure they register or re-register at the right address. ""If they are unsure about where they will be, students can register at both their term-time and home address, providing they only vote once,"" he said.""If they are going to be on holiday or are heading to Glastonbury, they should apply for a postal vote.""People had until 17:00 on 7 June to register if they wanted to vote in the referendum, he added. It is also possible to apply for a postal or proxy vote by 17:00 on 8 June. The interviews, carried out this month on a representative sample of students from across the UK by YouthSight for Universities UK, found: Universities UK and the Association of Colleges are holding voter registration drives at institutions across the UK. Students will be advised to register, re-register or apply for proxy or postal votes, according to their circumstances. UUK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said it was of ""real concern"" that so many students were unaware of the referendum date and that they might have to re-register to vote at another address. ""From this week, universities will be scaling up their efforts to encourage students to register to vote, and to make sure they do so in the right location,"" she said.""With nearly two million UK students eligible to vote in the referendum, it is vital that they have all the necessary information to make sure they can take part in this hugely important decision."""

A Downing Street spokesman said ""we don't accept"" Mr Baker's claims. In other EU referendum campaign developments:The government is campaigning for a vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum and Prime Minister David Cameron, whose party is divided on the issue, has previously called for a ""respectful"" debate. But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate ""breathtakingly disheartening"".Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in ""Downing Street hostage videos"".Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended ""into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people"".He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as ""economically illiterate"" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his ""preposterous, obscene"" remarks.""I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,"" said Mr Baker.Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as ""from the past"" following his intervention.Mr Baker claimed there had been ""intolerable media smears"" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: ""It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.""He added: ""If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign ""can't make an honest and positive case"" because they ""know it's a losing argument"".""So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,"" he said. He added: ""What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't accept Steve Baker's article.""All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.""The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: ""Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.""In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based ""employees worse off"".Writing in The Times, he warned financial jobs could leave London for Paris or Frankfurt and said ""a vote to leave is a risk""."

2016-05-20,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"The referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union, or remain a member, is on 23 June. So far, opinion polls suggest the campaign has had little impact on voters. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes assesses what the polls may be telling us.Read the full methodologyThere's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months. The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters. That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention. Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote. ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-20,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-20,Resident rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36316467,"It might seem peculiar that a young Australian here in Britain on a two-year working holiday is allowed to have a say on whether the UK should leave the European Union. But Michael Ingle, a 27-year-old physiotherapist living in Surrey, defends his right to participate in the 23 June referendum.He says that as a taxpayer, and a citizen of the Commonwealth, what happens to Britain is important to him and will have ramifications for the wider world well beyond the cliffs of Dover.""It's not just about Britain for me, which is why I've taken an interest in it,"" Mr Ingle, from Sydney, says.""It's about the West and the stability of this continent.""As a hangover from the days of empire, when so-called ""British subjects"" were included in the parliamentary franchise, Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK without British nationality retain the right to vote in elections.Estimates based on the 2011 census put the number of Commonwealth citizens eligible to vote in the forthcoming referendum at between 894,000 and more than 960,000.They join Irish citizens as the only non-Brits allowed to vote in what David Cameron has called a ""once in a generation"" decision. This has drawn the ire of groups including Migration Watch UK.Its chair, Lord Green of Deddington, says that ""important decisions about Britain should be taken by those who are British citizens and only by them"".A petition to parliament signed by more than 40,000 people, meanwhile, has claimed that allowing non-Brits to vote would bias the result towards the Remain side, especially given that the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta are also in the EU.But regardless of whether one agrees with the voting rules, such claims treat Commonwealth voters as a homogenous bloc of sorts, destined to vote in the same way.This obscures the fact that Commonwealth citizens living in Britain come from a diverse range of 53 countries in all the world's time zones.Voters of even the same age and nationality can have vastly different views on the subject at hand.Take Farhan Samsudin and Zila Fawzi, two young Malaysian women living in London.Farhan, who works in banking, says she will vote Remain on 23 June, despite what she says is the failure of either campaign to provide information on how the ""Commonwealth constituency"" might be affected by the result.She thinks the UK should strengthen its economic ties with Asian economies like Malaysia and sees membership of the EU as an obstacle in trade negotiations.Yet, with no clear plans presented to her on how a post-EU Britain would approach the world, she says she'll vote to stay.Zila, on the other hand, who is on a British government-funded scholarship, supports an EU exit.Her vote will be pinned on hopes that immigration policy will change in a way that benefits Commonwealth citizens if the UK no longer has to abide by free movement within the EU.""Once they are out of the EU it would be easier, especially for us Malaysians, to come and work here,"" she says.A postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, Zila is frustrated by the fact that any EU citizen is allowed to work in the UK, while highly educated Commonwealth citizens like her are turned away.On this point, Farhan chimes in.""The British government sponsors brilliant minds like her but they don't give any leeway for her to work here,"" she says, shaking her head. ""It's a real waste.""Avenues for Commonwealth citizens to migrate to the UK have become increasingly slim since the abolishment of working holiday visas (now limited to just a handful of countries under the Youth Mobility Scheme) and the post-study work visa, which allowed students to stay on for two years after the end of their course.Foreign students from outside the EU, many of whom are from the Commonwealth, now have just four months to find a job if they want to stay.The recent introduction of a £35,000 income threshold for non-EU skilled workers to settle in the UK in a bid to reduce net migration has led to further frustration and the spectre of mass deportations.Yet, while it would seem as though pro-Brexit campaigners could capitalise on the prickly issue of immigration in order to draw Commonwealth voters to their side, the issue is not so clear-cut.Given that some of the constituencies that the Leave campaign are courting harbour anti-immigrant sentiment, making a pitch to Commonwealth voters to back an EU exit based on immigration potential could see it take a hit elsewhere, says Ralph Buckle, director of the Commonwealth Exchange think tank.""Everyone has this number of what they think the right level of immigration is. It depends whether that number is high enough to include an increase [from] the Commonwealth.""The government's target of getting net migration under 100,000 annually also hovers ominously over any suggestion that more places could go to Commonwealth citizens if Brexit eventuated.The official Vote Leave campaign has said Britain could have a ""fairer"" migration policy that would ""make it easier for some to come, such as scientists and job-creators"" if the UK left the EU.In February Vote Leave published a letter to David Cameron from community and business leaders with Commonwealth links criticising immigration policy.""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom,"" they said.But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, speaking for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said that leaving the EU in order to end free movement would hurt everyone in Britain economically, including Commonwealth citizens.""Commonwealth citizens living in the UK benefit from jobs, lower prices and financial security we get from being part of the world's largest single market.""Commonwealth countries around the world, from Australia to Jamaica, are urging us to stay in the EU,"" he said.In a newspaper article last August, Lord Howell, chairman of Commonwealth Exchange and a former Conservative minister, said the polarity of the EU question was ""maddeningly oversimplified"" for internationally-minded Commonwealth citizens.He said the Leave campaign could not fall back on a ""little England mantra"", while the Remain camp would have to move away from ""seeing the continent as the UK's only future"".Mark Sultana, a 48-year-old long-time UK resident who organises events for fellow Canadians living in London, sees both sides of the picture.While he bemoans ""all the wastage and all the subsidies"" of the EU, he fears financial instability and losing the right to retire on the continent.""The whole thing is so complicated,"" he says.""I think ultimately even though I'm so anti all these things, so many things that the EU stands for… from the point of view of economic stability, the fact you're in it and that the world should be [becoming] a smaller place not a bigger place… [I would vote with] a grudging and qualified yes.""Mark also points out that the immigration argument means different things for different Commonwealth citizens.Canadians who live in the UK by virtue of European ancestry like himself, for example, might be fearful of losing that right in the case of a Brexit.""For that generation of that ilk, who came here, the European Union is very important. If you have Brexit there's a whole lot of people who would have trouble coming here.""For Brad Argent, meanwhile, having to deal with UK visa hassles despite being married to an English woman makes him feel like ""a second-class citizen"".The 50-year-old Australian, who works for an internet business, needs to wait for five years to get residency.""Whereas if I'm from Europe I can just come over on the train and set up house,"" he says outside Australia's High Commission on the Strand in London, where he has come to renew his passport.But Brad won't carry his these grievances to the ballot box, least of all because he does not want his British children to lose the right to work in the continent.""I think a vote to leave just out of spite because I'm a member of the Commonwealth, whilst that might feel good for about five minutes, I think the longer term implications I would start to regret,"" he says.With Commonwealth migrants unlikely to vote as a uniform bloc due to their divergent interests and circumstances, it appears either camp could still make a pitch to this 'constituency', which has largely been ignored in the debate thus far.After all, a million votes are at stake."
2016-05-20,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36345081,"The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Justice Secretary Michael Gove has unveiled Vote Leave's research on the effect free movement will have on the National Health Service.The document makes broad predictions, but even so, some of the assumptions it makes are questionable.The lower end of the forecast, that EU migration will rise by 2.58 million by 2030, is based on taking the most recent ONS net migration figure and multiplying it by 15.But the ONS actually produces a forecast for total net migration by 2029 (so not just from the EU), which it expects to have added 3 million to the population by then.Now there are uncertainties surrounding all forecasts, but it makes the bottom end of Vote Leave's forecast look somewhat high by comparison.To get to the higher ends of the forecast, the research assumes that all five current candidate countries wanting to join the EU (Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and FYR Macedonia) do so in 2020. This is very unlikely to happen. You can read more about why Turkey in particular is not going to join the EU by 2020 here. They also assume no transitional controls to limit migration from the new members. Existing states are allowed to impose seven years of restrictions to freedom of movement from new members, as the UK did with Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.Add to that the impact of the new National Living Wage and you get to Vote Leave's ""high"" forecast of 5.23 million. The quote from Michael Gove above is supposed to illustrate the ""medium"" forecast, which excludes the effect of the National Living Wage to get to a figure of 4.25 million. The population of Birmingham is about 1.1 million.It is hard to completely discount any forecast. Even so, the line about four Birminghams is hard to justify based on these such assumptions.From the figures on the growing population, the research gets to a figure on the extra demand from A&E departments, concluding that it would lead to an increase in demand of between 28% and 57%.It has reached these figures by looking at increases in A&E attendance since 2002 and noting a strong correlation with cumulative net migration over that time. In other words, attendances to A&E went up quickly at a time when there was continuous net migration to the UK.This relationship is then used to predict how future migration would affect demand for A&E.The problem is that while demand for A&E has gone up at the same time as there has been migration, the research has not demonstrated that one has caused the other.While it is clearly true that higher numbers of migrants would mean more A&E visits, it could be that A&E attendances have gone up for other reasons as well, so the relationship is not reliable.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-20,House of Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36330992,"It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that ""my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons"", she was signalling a retreat. Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers. A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits. Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention -  an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation. Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions. Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.Government to review Lords powers after tax credits defeatLimiting Lords powers 'calls its future into question'It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords. ""We're defeating the government more often than is good for us,"" a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?807Peers247 Conservative 211 Labour 175 Crossbench 109 Liberal Democrat Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation. My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight. 650Members of Parliament330 Conservative 229 Labour 54 SNP 8 Liberal Democrat ""There's no point in us existing,"" he told me, ""if we don't vote for the things we believe in.""That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened. In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems;  in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247. Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election. ""The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords,"" he says.Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place. ""It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is,"" says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a ""spurious"" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time. He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake. The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.""We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event,"" he said.David Cameron's real problem isn't peers, Lib Dem or otherwise. It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled. Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government. It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem. "

You could also look at the number of non-UK nationals (rather than everyone born abroad, which includes British citizens). They account for 56% of the rise.Responding to the latest unemployment figures, Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: ""Our labour market is thriving, but it's notable that more than three quarters of the rise in employment over the last year has come from people born abroad.""The figures suggest that people born abroad account for 80% of the rise in employment - as Mr Duncan Smith says, more than three quarters. But the figure for the number of people born abroad includes UK nationals who were born in other countries.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces figures for non-UK nationals working in the UK, which suggests 56% of the increase in employment may be attributed to non-UK nationals.In the context of the referendum the broader point the Leave Campaign has been making is that there's been a big increase in the proportion of people working in the UK who are EU nationals.The proportion of UK workers who are non-UK EU nationals has indeed increased considerably. In the first three months of this year, about 6.8% of UK workers were non-UK EU nationals. Five years ago that figure was 4.5% and 10 years ago it was 2.6%. If you look at the numbers behind that, at the moment there are 2.15 million EU nationals working in the UK. Five years ago it was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-20,War of words,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36304729,"The EU referendum debate is rapidly turning into a festival of name-calling and insults. How did we get here?It all started out so well. David Cameron decided to allow members of his cabinet to campaign for either side in the EU referendum. Some argue he had no choice, given the likelihood of resignations. Others wondered how it would work, with big personalities like Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith having public disagreements with Mr Cameron and George Osborne one minute and then calmly putting aside their differences the next to get on with running the country. But both sides insisted they could be grown up about it.  ""We should all be big enough to have an honest and open, but polite disagreement, and then come back together again afterwards,"" said Mr Cameron.Announcing his decision to join the Leave campaign in February, Boris Johnson praised the PM's renegotiation attempts, and urged his divided Conservative colleagues to ""play the ball and not the man"". There was plenty of ill-feeling flying around before the debate proper got under way, with a bitter and personal row between the two rival Leave campaigns and mutterings from Eurosceptic backbenchers about how little they thought Mr Cameron had achieved in his renegotiations.But the big beasts managed to keep it relatively civil, with personal attacks couched in the coded language of Westminster. David Cameron's comments in the Commons, shortly after Boris Johnson joined the Leave camp, about having ""no other agenda than what is best for our country"" was interpreted as a jibe at the former London mayor's leadership ambitions. It was written up in the press as a ""war"" between the two men. Iain Duncan Smith may have resigned from the Cabinet over cuts to disability benefits in March's Budget - but it gave him freedom to say what he really thinks about David Cameron and George Osborne and their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. And he has not held back. He has been scathing about Mr Cameron's renegotiations, claiming he achieved ""nothing"", and has accused the Remain campaign of ""spin, smears and threats"" to try to ""bully"" Britons into voting to stay. He has also appealed for calm, warning that all the rows risk long-term damage to the Conservative Party.What has enraged the Leave camp, possibly more than anything else, is the way in which they think the prime minister has used the might of the government machine to rig the referendum debate in his favour. The government's decision, in April, to spend £9m on sending a glossy brochure to every household in the country led to loud cries of foul play. David Cameron said the government was entitled to state its case. But Boris Johnson claimed the PM had reneged on his promise to ""fight fair"" during the referendum because he was ""losing the argument"". The Treasury's analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit provoked an even more furious reaction from the Leavers, particularly when George Osborne accused them of being ""economically illiterate"". The former Mayor of London has been on vintage form during this campaign, dreaming up ever more inventive ways of trashing the Remain campaign, headed by his old friend and rival David Cameron.He has compared them to jeweller Gerald Ratner, who famously called his own products ""crap"". He has described the global leaders backing the Remain campaign as appearing in Downing Street ""hostage videos"".A visit to an underwear factory in Derbyshire proved to be a target rich environment for the ex-Mayor.He compared the EU to a ""badly designed undergarment"", shouted ""pants on fire"" at the Remain campaign, before unleashing the inevitable battle cry:  ""Knickers to all those who talk Britain down.""David Cameron has largely avoided slinging mud back at Boris, but another Old Etonian Conservative MP has stepped manfully into the breach. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill and ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, is not a fan of the former London mayor, it seems.When Mr Johnson penned an article referencing Barack Obama's ""part Kenyan"" ancestry, Sir Nicholas had this to say on LBC radio:  ""I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive.""Sir Nicholas has kept up the Boris-baiting on his Twitter account, calling him the ""unchallenged master of the self inflicted wound"" and branding his comments about Hitler and the EU ""absurd, desperate and outright offensive"".With Labour MPs and members overwhelmingly supportive of the Remain campaign, ""red on red"" attacks have been less frequent than the ""blue on blue"" variety.  But Jeremy Corbyn's previous Eurosceptic sentiments have not gone unnoticed by the Labour Leave campaign. Labour MP Kate Hoey suggested the Labour leader (motto ""straight talking, honest politics"") was being less than straight with his decision to embrace the Remain cause.She said Labour voters would ""see through"" him. ""We know first of all, that he doesn't really mean it, no matter how much he tries to pretend he does, and secondly, that it is not in the interest of the Labour movement,"" she told the BBC News channel.Mr Corbyn says he wants to stay in the EU to fight for social reforms and workers' rights.The prime minister's warning that peace could be at risk from an EU exit did not go down well with the Leave side. It was mocked by Boris Johnson, who said it was ""very curious"" that the prime minister had called a referendum on leaving the EU, only to warn us ""that World War III is about to break out unless we vote to remain"".The Leave campaign's constant refrain is that Remain are trying to scare voters into backing their side. They call it Project Fear.The Remain campaign, for its part, have tried to suggest the Leavers are a bunch of swivel-eyed conspiracy theorists.""The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster,"" said George Osborne last week, on a visit to Stansted airport with Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable.There is an old internet maxim, known as Godwin's Law, that states the longer a debate goes on the more likely it is that someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.It was Boris Johnson who proved it correct last week, when he compared the EU's efforts to unify Europe to Hitler's. This was the moment that turned simmering tensions into (apologies for mixing the metaphors) a full-blown firestorm.Lord Heseltine - a longstanding supporter of the EU - suggested that the strain of the campaign must be getting to Boris Johnson, causing him to lose his judgement, blasting Mr Johnson's Hitler article as ""preposterous"" and ""obscene"" and suggesting he is not fit be Tory leader.Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Lord Heseltine as a ""voice from the past"" and fellow Leave campaigner Steve Baker accused Downing Street of being behind ""vicious briefings"" against his side, as he called for an end to ""personal nastiness"".And that is where we are today, with Conservative MPs on all sides appealing for an end to ""blue-on-blue"" conflict as the civil war in their party appears to rage out of control.But at least one Tory Leave campaigner is taking the longer view. Jacob-Rees Mogg,  writing in the Financial Times has drawn parallels with Conservative splits over the Corn Laws in the 19th century.""The Tory party survived great splits when its discipline and structures were much less well founded than they are now. The EU referendum will decide the matter of Europe for a generation - and the party is united in all other important policy areas."""

2016-05-20,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.Lords chief whip - Lord Bassam of BrightonFormer leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.Shadow minister without portfolio - Jonathan Ashworth Labour shadow cabinet in fullThe Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband.

The Wentworth and Dearne held a range of post during the Labour government, including financial secretary to the Treasury and local government minister.Shadow attorney general - Karl TurnerThe MP for Hull East took over the role of Labour's chief legal adviser after the resignation of Catherine McKinnell.

2016-05-21,Corbyn outlines 'new economics' vision,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36351149,"Labour will seek to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly, Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he set out his party's plans for the economy.Addressing activists, he called for a ""mixed economy of public and social enterprise... a private sector with a long-term private business commitment"".He said a Labour government would break from the ""failed economic orthodoxy"".Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesOsborne warns Brexit will hit house pricesAt Labour's ""state of the economy"" conference in west London, Mr Corbyn set out his desire to reform capitalism and said his party needed to ""deliver the new economy that this country needs"".""An economy that starts by tackling the grotesque levels of inequality within our society,"" went on Mr Corbyn. ""An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment.""Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  ""Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. ""A new economics.""He said: ""Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared.""By Chris Mason, BBC News political correspondentHaving survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch. Mr Corbyn called it ""a new economics"". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the ""fundamental business of reforming capitalism"".So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.No one can doubt their ambition: ""I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform,"" the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS. But to do that, they have to win the next general election.Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough so they can fight that election? And if they do, can Messrs Corbyn and McDonnell sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money. ""We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances,"" he said. Councils would be given the power to limit ""skyrocketing"" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people ""at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market"".The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.The ""local rent regulation"" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to ""pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords"", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was ""creating a bigger and better private rented sector"". ""These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent,"" she said."

2016-05-21,Osborne 'Pinocchio' on Brexit forecast,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36351310,"Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has compared George Osborne to ""Pinocchio"" over his claim that a vote to leave the EU would cause an economic shock to UK house prices.The chancellor earlier said that in the event of a vote for Brexit, by 2018, houses could be worth up to 18% less than if the UK voted to remain.But Mr Duncan Smith said the claim reminded him of ""the nose growing rather long"". Treasury analysis is due next week. Its report will suggest that two years after a Brexit vote, UK house prices could be between 10% and 18% lower than after a remain vote.""If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like,"" Mr Osborne said.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowG7 finance ministers also think a UK exit would cause a ""shock"" to the world economy.After two-day talks in Japan they said it would complicate the world economy alongside geopolitical conflict, terrorism and the refugee crisis.The International Monetary Fund last Friday also said Brexit could cause a ""sharp drop"" in house prices.But former Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, cast doubt on the chancellor's forecast, saying: ""When I heard that I did think of Pinocchio and the nose growing rather long here.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.He said Mr Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2010 because Treasury reports could not be trusted as ""they were always fiddled with by chancellors of the exchequer"". He also said that the Treasury had failed to predict either the recession or a November fall in tax receipts. ""Now what we have had is a whole series of Treasury reports telling us the world is going to end, we are going to end up with lower house prices, the economy is going to be bad,"" he said. ""Even the Treasury has to admit under their most pessimistic forecast, the British economy would continue to grow after we left the European Union. And, this report also says house prices would continue to grow. ""My point is very simple, they do not know.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonWith four and a bit weeks to go until referendum day, voters find themselves swimming in a murky ocean of questionable statistics. And when I say questionable, I'm being polite.August bodies and grand figures on both sides are making bold claims. And they are both guessing. So what's happening here? Each side is playing what it sees as its greatest hit. The let's stay in brigade talk about the economy. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.The let's get out brigade talk about immigration. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.There will be plenty more claims where these came from before you pick up that stubby little pencil in a draughty polling station.Mr Osborne earlier told the BBC an ""economic shock"" would follow a vote for Britain to leave the EU. ""In the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer,"" he said. ""That affects the value of people's homes. And at the same time, first-time buyers are hit because mortgage rates go up, and mortgages become more difficult to get. So it's a lose-lose situation.""Campaigners for Vote Leave have previously said that lower house prices would help first-time buyers and those in the rental market.Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable tweeted: ""Osborne on house prices. Surely big price fall good for affordability and economic balance. Stick to jobs and basic economics George.""On Thursday, estate agents claimed a Brexit would take about £2,200 off average house prices by 2018.Ratings agency Moody's also said curbing immigration would ease competition for housing, and slow down house price and rental inflation.Also on Saturday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged mothers to vote for the UK to stay in the EU for the sake of their children.He told a conference of left-of-centre think tank the Fabian Society: ""To mothers who are worried about the prospects for their children in the future and want to know where the jobs will come from, to people who feel that globalisation is a runaway train and it's out of control and uncontrollable, we've got to show that we can manage that in the public interest.""

2016-05-21,Staying in EU adds 5m to population - Gove,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36341206,"Staying in the EU could increase the UK's population by up to 5.23m by 2030, Vote Leave has claimed, putting the NHS under ""unsustainable"" pressure.Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the estimates were ""robust"" and voting to leave the EU would strengthen the NHS.He argued the National Living Wage was an extra ""pull factor"" for migrants. Remain campaigners say the 5m figure is ""absurd"" as it is based on five states joining the EU by 2020, which they say ""is not remotely on the cards"".Politics Live: Updates from the EU referendum campaignPrime Minister David Cameron has said it will be ""decades"" before Turkey joins the EU and there is no firm date for the accession of Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia.A document from Vote Leave says the EU's commitment to the free movement of people and the UK's new National Living Wage mean net migration from the EU to the UK will be between 170,000 and 430,000 a year - adding between 2.58m and 5.23m people to the UK population by 2030.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.The group calculates the NHS could have to contend with a new group of patients the size of ""four Birminghams"", and A&E demand could increase by up to 57%. Voting to leave could mean ""millions of pounds saved in ending EU contributions"" could be given to ""strengthen"" the NHS instead, Mr Gove said. ""Boris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear that the NHS will only face additional pressures. ""Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU into UK every year.""But the EU was committed to allowing five new countries to join, he said, whose citizens would ""inevitably"" be attracted to the UK: ""The idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable.""The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Read moreThe Office for National Statistics predicts that net migration to the UK - from countries across the world, not just the EU - will add up to just under three million by 2029.Vote Leave says the ONS has ""consistently underestimated the true level of migration"" in the past and there are ""strong reasons to doubt this forecast"".Mr Gove stood by the Vote Leave figures, describing them as ""robust and methodologically fair"" and denied abandoning the economic argument - which Vote Leave had been focused on at the start of the campaign - to concentrate on immigration. But the Remain campaign said it was ""absurd"" to base figures on five new EU states by 2020 and the UK could veto any new country joining, and apply restrictions on free movement for new EU states.They pointed to comments made by Vote Leave's Boris Johnson to LBC radio in March, when he said Turkey would not join the EU ""in the foreseeable future"" and the idea of 75 million Turks having visa-free travel was ""simply not on the cards"".Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is campaigning the UK to remain in the EU, said: ""I think these figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they're not designed to inform - they're designed to confuse.""And former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said: ""Wrecking the economy by leaving Europe would make our NHS weaker - and patients would pay the price.""These figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU's Single Market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people's wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a £36 billion black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service.""""Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.""Meanwhile European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Le Monde that Britain would have to accept being treated like an outsider if it votes to leave the EU. ""Deserters won't be welcomed with open arms,"" he said.""That is not a threat, but our relations will no longer be as they are today"".But UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker's ""whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels"" adding: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat.""And Vote Leave's Labour chair Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low."""

2016-05-21,Two Britons lose EU vote legal bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36341839,"Two Britons living abroad have lost their Court of Appeal battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.The challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan, 54.Under law, UK citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote. The pair took the case to the Court of Appeal after losing their application for a judicial review last month. Mr Shindler and Ms MacLennan had argued the in-out vote on EU membership, on 23 June, directly affected them and brought the test case on behalf of others in their situation.In April, they asked High Court judges to declare that section two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established ""the 15-year rule"", unlawfully acted as a penalty for their having exercised their rights to free movement.But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.They then took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a one-day hearing took place earlier this month. Three appeal judges - Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King - upheld the High Court decision on Friday, declaring the rule did not unlawfully interfere with the right of expats to freedom of movement within the European Union.EU campaign latestEU vote: All you need to knowUK stars back remaining in EUStudents risk missing voteLord Dyson said: ""The claimants say that their exclusion from the franchise is an unjustified restriction on their EU right - EU law right - of free movement and contrary to their constitutional, common law right to vote. ""The appeals against the dismissal of their claims is dismissed. The court holds first that the 2015 Act does not fall within the scope of EU law at all, so that the claim fails at the first hurdle.""He added that ""the common law right to vote does not take precedence over an Act of Parliament"" and refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The expats still have the right to ask Supreme Court judges to consider the case, however. Their lawyers said a hearing had been listed for Tuesday, at which permission to appeal - as well as the substance of the appeal itself - would be considered.Those eligible can register to vote here.The non-Britons who get an EU voteMs McLennan, who is originally from Inverness but has lived in Brussels since 1987, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The refusal to allow me and others in my situation to vote is an infringement of my EU rights.""She added that the result of the vote ""would have a huge impact"" on both her personal and professional life, and that she often returned to the UK to visit her parents and children, and for work. ""I feel very strongly that I ought to have a fundamental democratic right to vote in my country of citizenship,"" said Ms McLennan.Mr Shindler, appointed an MBE for Anglo-Italian relations in 2014, has been told he has ""diminished or diluted"" links to the UK after living abroad for so long. He has lived in Italy for 35 years. The UK passport holder, originally from London, said: ""The fact that we don't live there doesn't alter that fact, we were born British and we will remain that way. ""If we go and live somewhere else, it doesn't make us anything else. They work out here. People don't know who these expats are you know, think they're all on holiday.""He also said the government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed.Law firm Leigh Day, which represents the pair, argued that up to two million British citizens were being unlawfully denied the right to vote on membership of the EU."
2016-05-21,Care 'could suffer' as NHS busts budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36341235,"Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out. Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"".""We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care.""The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service. There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS ""could not be bleaker"".""The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.""There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.""Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black holeFinancial problems 'endemic in the NHS'Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Nearly nine in 10 hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterTaken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was ""cooking up accounting alchemy"" by ""turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury"". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎""We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff,"" he added.The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published."

Let's not become an outsider shouting from the wings.""The Stronger In campaign says that more than 2.2 million people are employed in the UK's creative industries and digital sector. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.It argues that the creative and digital industries export billions of pounds of services to the EU and are among the fastest-growing sectors of the UK economy.Prime Minister David Cameron met some of the stars campaigning for Remain at a visit to the famous Abbey Road studios in London, with former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell.Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign, said leaving the EU would mean higher tariffs on exports and digital and creative industries were ""better off with the UK in EU"" with access to the single market.But speaking in a personal capacity, the Conservative peer and author Lord Dobbs, said: ""Our creative industries are booming because of the talent that is in Britain's DNA. ""We are world leaders in so many creative areas. From theatre to literature, video games, feature films, fashion, music and so much else, British artists lead the way and are celebrated around the globe. ""It's a success that has been created by the dedication, hard work and extraordinary creative abilities of our artists, it's not because of the EU."" He added: ""Culture owes nothing to committees. ""Ancient Greece was the birthplace of our civilisation yet today, because of the EU's appalling policies, streets that were once filled with the world's greatest philosophers and playwrights are choked with desperate beggars and mountains of rotting rubbish. ""These are the realities of the EU. It's failing. The dream is dead. We need to move on.""Conservative Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he did not think people should be ""swayed by celebrities"".Meanwhile Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has entered the debate, warning that Canada's own trade deal with the EU had taken more than ten years to negotiate and was yet to enter force.""There's nothing easy or automatic about that,"" he said.""Britain is always going to have clout, it's just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU. I believe we're always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn't seem to be a productive path for countries.""The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has defended Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's intervention in the debate last week, when he warned that a vote to leave could cause a recession.Mr Trichet told BBC's This Week's World there was an ""obligation"" for the central bank to ""say candidly what they see"".Those behind the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union said Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the risks of Brexit. Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC he ""wouldn't expect"" a major financial institution to back the Leave campaign ""because they all wanted to protect the status quo"".And Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, has described ""this daily avalanche of institutional propaganda"" as ""ludicrous and pitiful"".

I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.Updates on this story and more from DerbyshireThe man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them. ""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"". ""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this."" Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""But she accused Leave campaigners of offering ""false promises"" that if the UK left the EU there would be a ""substantial"" change on migration policy."
2016-05-21,Cameron heads off EU trade deal revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36332415,"Downing Street has headed off a revolt over the Queen's Speech by saying it will accept a move to exclude the NHS from a controversial EU-US trade deal. Tory rebels were threatening to join Labour and the SNP to back an amendment ""regretting"" the lack of a bill to protect the NHS from the TTIP deal.But Downing Street has denied them the chance by saying they will back it.One of the MPs tabling the amendment, Labour's Paula Sherriff, described it as a ""humiliating climbdown"" by the PM.""They will now be the first government in history to officially 'regret' their own programme within days of announcing it, just months after doing the same on their Budget,"" she said.Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Steve Baker MP said: ""The government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.""But a spokesman for Number 10 said: ""As we've said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this amendment is selected, we'll accept it.""Also on Thursday, David Cameron told LBC radio  he did not want the EU referendum to become a ""Tory psycho-drama"" involving him and senior ""Leave"" Conservatives Boris Johnson and Michael Gove but claimed former London mayor Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a leaver"". He also described himself as a Eurosceptic but said he believed it was better that the UK remain in the EU.Mr Johnson, in response, said he had been a ""Eurosceptic for decades"" and said: ""I urge my friends in government to recognise that in all logic, and as self-declared Eurosceptics, they should really be campaigning with us on this side of the argument.""The TTIP amendment - signed by 25 Tory MPs - expressed regret that the government has not brought forward a bill to protect the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, currently being negotiated between the EU and the US. Although it would have been a purely symbolic vote, no government has suffered a defeat on a Queen's Speech, which sets out its legislative programme for the year ahead, since 1924.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long opposed TTIP, had said he would back the Conservative rebels.It is understood the SNP and other minority parties were also likely to support the amendment.Sources in the Vote Leave campaign predicted the government had faced defeat unless it backed down.Conservative former minister Peter Lilley, who supported the amendment, said that although he supports free trade, TTIP would introduce ""special courts which are not necessary for free trade, will give American multinationals the right to sue our government (but not vice versa) and could put our NHS at risk"".TTIP is primarily a deal to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade between the US and EU countries, making it potentially easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other's markets.Industries it would affect include pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing and food and drink.The government says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars.In the UK, attention has focused on the potential impact on the NHS, with critics saying TTIP would allow private firms running NHS services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector.What is the future for UK-US trade?Labour MP Frank Field, who backed the amendment, said: ""We can't have kangaroo courts, operating only to America's advantage, deciding how we should trade in respect of the NHS.""SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: ""The SNP have been at the forefront of the campaign to protect the NHS and other public services from the potential consequences of TTIP, and so we welcome any opportunity to ensure that the Tory government keep the promises they have already made.""But former Labour minister Rachel Reeves, writing on the Labour List website, said: ""Those who want Britain to leave the EU need to stop preying on British peoples' love for the NHS by cynically pretending that TTIP poses a threat. It does not. ""They are demeaning their own campaign by arguing a case they know to be untrue.""But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who like Ms Reeves is backing the Remain campaign, said she would vote for the amendment.She said: ""If we left the EU, then we could be left with the government negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. What then? ""With the Tories still in charge, we could then expect the roll out of multiple TTIPs on steroids as Britain negotiated trade deals with countries across the world."""
2016-05-21,Lib Dem cabinet post welcomed by Farron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36335307,"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has welcomed Kirsty Williams's plan to be education secretary in an otherwise all Labour Welsh Government.  Mr Farron said she would ""retain her independence"" and aim to make education in Wales ""markedly better"" then in the rest of the UK. Ms Williams's appointment is subject to a vote of Welsh Lib Dem members at a special conference on Saturday.She has said she is not taking party support on the matter for granted.The AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, who boosted her majority over the Conservatives at the assembly election to more than 8,000, was named by First Minister Carwyn Jones on Thursday as part of an eight-member cabinet.Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme on Friday, Mr Farron said Ms Williams's cabinet role would be ""great news for education in Wales"". ""Kirsty has that great strength of somebody with great experience of education, the mother of three children who are in Welsh state schools, and somebody who's very committed to making a difference."" Mr Farron said he was ""very impressed"" with the ""hard achievements"" the Liberal Democrats would get out of the agreement with Labour.""But my aim is, and Kirsty's aim will be, that education in Wales will be markedly better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of Kirsty and the Liberal Democrats' involvement in this administration."" Asked if she was confident of getting her party's support, the former Welsh Lib Dem leader said: ""I never take anything for granted in politics.""The great thing about being a member of the Welsh Liberal Democrats [is that] it's not up to individuals to make these choices. ""Every single member of our party will have an opportunity to have their say and have a vote on this decision.""Ms Williams denied her appointment would effectively mean her party ceased to exist in the assembly.""It exists with a cabinet minister, hopefully subject to the party agreement, being able to implement Welsh Liberal Democrat policies and influencing the agenda,"" she said.""That's a lot stronger than being a single assembly member on a backbench.""Ms Williams said she would never leave her party, and did not think Labour, Plaid and the Welsh Liberal Democrats should merge or have a formal relationship.""There are different traditions and political strands that are represented by each of the parties.""What is important is that we look to work where we can together and recognise that the way in which politics happens in Wales is changing.""It isn't about one single party driving home their manifesto without due reference to other voices.""The deal between Ms Williams and Labour agrees a list of nine common priorities which include pledges from the Welsh Lib Dem election manifesto, such as:It also calls for the upcoming recommendations of the Diamond Review into student finance to be considered ""with a view to early implementation where appropriate"" but with no ""negative effect"" on the higher education budget.The Lib Dem tuition fee policy at the election was to end tuition fee support grants that students currently get. The party proposed to replace it with a student living support grant funded by the other grant's withdrawal - but this is not written into the agreement.Ms Williams was the only opposition AM to back Mr Jones in the first deadlocked vote for first minister - despite Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP supporting Plaid leader Leanne Wood.Mr Jones was later reinstated after he came to an agreement with Plaid Cymru - although no members of that party were appointed to his cabinet.Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said it is unlikely all the policies in the agreement between Ms Williams and Welsh Labour will get support of parties outside the government.He said on Twitter: ""Important to note these policies will need opposition support to be implemented. Unlikely that all will succeed.""The senior Plaid figure also questioned the Lib Dems' pledge in the agreement to reduce infant class sizes to 25.He said that ""most evidence suggests you need to reduce to 15 to have any real effect. Reducing to 25 is costly but ineffective"".Meanwhile UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said Ms Williams should resign her seat and seek a fresh mandate in a by-election.He said: ""When UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless left their old parties, they did the honourable thing and went back to their electors at a by-election to seek a new mandate to represent them.""Kirsty is now duty bound to support Labour 100% over this five-year assembly term. ""I call on her to take the same honourable course and seek a fresh mandate from her constituents because, in all but name, she has now become a Labour AM."" "
2016-05-21,Students risk missing referendum vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36303347,"UK university students believe the EU referendum is key to their future, but almost two-thirds do not know when it is, suggests research. And a third of more than 2,000 students questioned feared being unable to get to their polling station on the day. The referendum, on 23 June, is outside term time, so many students will need to re-register at their home address, says the National Union of Students. NUS vice-president Richard Brooks urged students ""to think ahead"". ""The EU referendum is a once-in-a-generation vote,"" said Mr Brooks. ""The decision made on the 23 June will impact young people and students the most, as they are the ones that will live with the consequences for the longest.""If students don't want their future decided for them, it is essential that as many as possible get out and vote.""Mr Brooks urged students to think about where they would be on referendum day and to make sure they register or re-register at the right address. ""If they are unsure about where they will be, students can register at both their term-time and home address, providing they only vote once,"" he said.""If they are going to be on holiday or are heading to Glastonbury, they should apply for a postal vote.""People had until 17:00 on 7 June to register if they wanted to vote in the referendum, he added. It is also possible to apply for a postal or proxy vote by 17:00 on 8 June. The interviews, carried out this month on a representative sample of students from across the UK by YouthSight for Universities UK, found: Universities UK and the Association of Colleges are holding voter registration drives at institutions across the UK. Students will be advised to register, re-register or apply for proxy or postal votes, according to their circumstances. UUK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said it was of ""real concern"" that so many students were unaware of the referendum date and that they might have to re-register to vote at another address. ""From this week, universities will be scaling up their efforts to encourage students to register to vote, and to make sure they do so in the right location,"" she said.""With nearly two million UK students eligible to vote in the referendum, it is vital that they have all the necessary information to make sure they can take part in this hugely important decision."""

But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate ""breathtakingly disheartening"".Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in ""Downing Street hostage videos"".Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended ""into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people"".He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as ""economically illiterate"" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his ""preposterous, obscene"" remarks.""I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,"" said Mr Baker.Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as ""from the past"" following his intervention.Mr Baker claimed there had been ""intolerable media smears"" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: ""It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.""He added: ""If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign ""can't make an honest and positive case"" because they ""know it's a losing argument"".""So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,"" he said. He added: ""What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't accept Steve Baker's article.""All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.""The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: ""Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.""In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based ""employees worse off"".Writing in The Times, he warned financial jobs could leave London for Paris or Frankfurt and said ""a vote to leave is a risk""."

2016-05-21,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"The referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union, or remain a member, is on 23 June. So far, opinion polls suggest the campaign has had little impact on voters. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes assesses what the polls may be telling us.Read the full methodologyThere's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months. The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters. That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention. Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote. ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-21,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-21,Resident rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36316467,"It might seem peculiar that a young Australian here in Britain on a two-year working holiday is allowed to have a say on whether the UK should leave the European Union. But Michael Ingle, a 27-year-old physiotherapist living in Surrey, defends his right to participate in the 23 June referendum.He says that as a taxpayer, and a citizen of the Commonwealth, what happens to Britain is important to him and will have ramifications for the wider world well beyond the cliffs of Dover.""It's not just about Britain for me, which is why I've taken an interest in it,"" Mr Ingle, from Sydney, says.""It's about the West and the stability of this continent.""As a hangover from the days of empire, when so-called ""British subjects"" were included in the parliamentary franchise, Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK without British nationality retain the right to vote in elections.Estimates based on the 2011 census put the number of Commonwealth citizens eligible to vote in the forthcoming referendum at between 894,000 and more than 960,000.They join Irish citizens as the only non-Brits allowed to vote in what David Cameron has called a ""once in a generation"" decision. This has drawn the ire of groups including Migration Watch UK.Its chair, Lord Green of Deddington, says that ""important decisions about Britain should be taken by those who are British citizens and only by them"".A petition to parliament signed by more than 40,000 people, meanwhile, has claimed that allowing non-Brits to vote would bias the result towards the Remain side, especially given that the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta are also in the EU.But regardless of whether one agrees with the voting rules, such claims treat Commonwealth voters as a homogenous bloc of sorts, destined to vote in the same way.This obscures the fact that Commonwealth citizens living in Britain come from a diverse range of 53 countries in all the world's time zones.Voters of even the same age and nationality can have vastly different views on the subject at hand.Take Farhan Samsudin and Zila Fawzi, two young Malaysian women living in London.Farhan, who works in banking, says she will vote Remain on 23 June, despite what she says is the failure of either campaign to provide information on how the ""Commonwealth constituency"" might be affected by the result.She thinks the UK should strengthen its economic ties with Asian economies like Malaysia and sees membership of the EU as an obstacle in trade negotiations.Yet, with no clear plans presented to her on how a post-EU Britain would approach the world, she says she'll vote to stay.Zila, on the other hand, who is on a British government-funded scholarship, supports an EU exit.Her vote will be pinned on hopes that immigration policy will change in a way that benefits Commonwealth citizens if the UK no longer has to abide by free movement within the EU.""Once they are out of the EU it would be easier, especially for us Malaysians, to come and work here,"" she says.A postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, Zila is frustrated by the fact that any EU citizen is allowed to work in the UK, while highly educated Commonwealth citizens like her are turned away.On this point, Farhan chimes in.""The British government sponsors brilliant minds like her but they don't give any leeway for her to work here,"" she says, shaking her head. ""It's a real waste.""Avenues for Commonwealth citizens to migrate to the UK have become increasingly slim since the abolishment of working holiday visas (now limited to just a handful of countries under the Youth Mobility Scheme) and the post-study work visa, which allowed students to stay on for two years after the end of their course.Foreign students from outside the EU, many of whom are from the Commonwealth, now have just four months to find a job if they want to stay.The recent introduction of a £35,000 income threshold for non-EU skilled workers to settle in the UK in a bid to reduce net migration has led to further frustration and the spectre of mass deportations.Yet, while it would seem as though pro-Brexit campaigners could capitalise on the prickly issue of immigration in order to draw Commonwealth voters to their side, the issue is not so clear-cut.Given that some of the constituencies that the Leave campaign are courting harbour anti-immigrant sentiment, making a pitch to Commonwealth voters to back an EU exit based on immigration potential could see it take a hit elsewhere, says Ralph Buckle, director of the Commonwealth Exchange think tank.""Everyone has this number of what they think the right level of immigration is. It depends whether that number is high enough to include an increase [from] the Commonwealth.""The government's target of getting net migration under 100,000 annually also hovers ominously over any suggestion that more places could go to Commonwealth citizens if Brexit eventuated.The official Vote Leave campaign has said Britain could have a ""fairer"" migration policy that would ""make it easier for some to come, such as scientists and job-creators"" if the UK left the EU.In February Vote Leave published a letter to David Cameron from community and business leaders with Commonwealth links criticising immigration policy.""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom,"" they said.But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, speaking for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said that leaving the EU in order to end free movement would hurt everyone in Britain economically, including Commonwealth citizens.""Commonwealth citizens living in the UK benefit from jobs, lower prices and financial security we get from being part of the world's largest single market.""Commonwealth countries around the world, from Australia to Jamaica, are urging us to stay in the EU,"" he said.In a newspaper article last August, Lord Howell, chairman of Commonwealth Exchange and a former Conservative minister, said the polarity of the EU question was ""maddeningly oversimplified"" for internationally-minded Commonwealth citizens.He said the Leave campaign could not fall back on a ""little England mantra"", while the Remain camp would have to move away from ""seeing the continent as the UK's only future"".Mark Sultana, a 48-year-old long-time UK resident who organises events for fellow Canadians living in London, sees both sides of the picture.While he bemoans ""all the wastage and all the subsidies"" of the EU, he fears financial instability and losing the right to retire on the continent.""The whole thing is so complicated,"" he says.""I think ultimately even though I'm so anti all these things, so many things that the EU stands for… from the point of view of economic stability, the fact you're in it and that the world should be [becoming] a smaller place not a bigger place… [I would vote with] a grudging and qualified yes.""Mark also points out that the immigration argument means different things for different Commonwealth citizens.Canadians who live in the UK by virtue of European ancestry like himself, for example, might be fearful of losing that right in the case of a Brexit.""For that generation of that ilk, who came here, the European Union is very important. If you have Brexit there's a whole lot of people who would have trouble coming here.""For Brad Argent, meanwhile, having to deal with UK visa hassles despite being married to an English woman makes him feel like ""a second-class citizen"".The 50-year-old Australian, who works for an internet business, needs to wait for five years to get residency.""Whereas if I'm from Europe I can just come over on the train and set up house,"" he says outside Australia's High Commission on the Strand in London, where he has come to renew his passport.But Brad won't carry his these grievances to the ballot box, least of all because he does not want his British children to lose the right to work in the continent.""I think a vote to leave just out of spite because I'm a member of the Commonwealth, whilst that might feel good for about five minutes, I think the longer term implications I would start to regret,"" he says.With Commonwealth migrants unlikely to vote as a uniform bloc due to their divergent interests and circumstances, it appears either camp could still make a pitch to this 'constituency', which has largely been ignored in the debate thus far.After all, a million votes are at stake."
2016-05-21,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36345081,"The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Justice Secretary Michael Gove has unveiled Vote Leave's research on the effect free movement will have on the National Health Service.The document makes broad predictions, but even so, some of the assumptions it makes are questionable.The lower end of the forecast, that EU migration will rise by 2.58 million by 2030, is based on taking the most recent ONS net migration figure and multiplying it by 15.But the ONS actually produces a forecast for total net migration by 2029 (so not just from the EU), which it expects to have added 3 million to the population by then.Now there are uncertainties surrounding all forecasts, but it makes the bottom end of Vote Leave's forecast look somewhat high by comparison.To get to the higher ends of the forecast, the research assumes that all five current candidate countries wanting to join the EU (Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and FYR Macedonia) do so in 2020. This is very unlikely to happen. You can read more about why Turkey in particular is not going to join the EU by 2020 here. They also assume no transitional controls to limit migration from the new members. Existing states are allowed to impose seven years of restrictions to freedom of movement from new members, as the UK did with Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.Add to that the impact of the new National Living Wage and you get to Vote Leave's ""high"" forecast of 5.23 million. The quote from Michael Gove above is supposed to illustrate the ""medium"" forecast, which excludes the effect of the National Living Wage to get to a figure of 4.25 million. The population of Birmingham is about 1.1 million.It is hard to completely discount any forecast. Even so, the line about four Birminghams is hard to justify based on these such assumptions.From the figures on the growing population, the research gets to a figure on the extra demand from A&E departments, concluding that it would lead to an increase in demand of between 28% and 57%.It has reached these figures by looking at increases in A&E attendance since 2002 and noting a strong correlation with cumulative net migration over that time. In other words, attendances to A&E went up quickly at a time when there was continuous net migration to the UK.This relationship is then used to predict how future migration would affect demand for A&E.The problem is that while demand for A&E has gone up at the same time as there has been migration, the research has not demonstrated that one has caused the other.While it is clearly true that higher numbers of migrants would mean more A&E visits, it could be that A&E attendances have gone up for other reasons as well, so the relationship is not reliable.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-21,House of Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36330992,"It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that ""my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons"", she was signalling a retreat. Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers. A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits. Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention -  an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation. Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions. Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.Government to review Lords powers after tax credits defeatLimiting Lords powers 'calls its future into question'It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords. ""We're defeating the government more often than is good for us,"" a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?807Peers247 Conservative 211 Labour 175 Crossbench 109 Liberal Democrat Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation. My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight. 650Members of Parliament330 Conservative 229 Labour 54 SNP 8 Liberal Democrat ""There's no point in us existing,"" he told me, ""if we don't vote for the things we believe in.""That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened. In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems;  in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247. Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election. ""The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords,"" he says.Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place. ""It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is,"" says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a ""spurious"" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time. He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake. The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.""We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event,"" he said.David Cameron's real problem isn't peers, Lib Dem or otherwise. It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled. Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government. It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem. "

You could also look at the number of non-UK nationals (rather than everyone born abroad, which includes British citizens). They account for 56% of the rise.Responding to the latest unemployment figures, Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: ""Our labour market is thriving, but it's notable that more than three quarters of the rise in employment over the last year has come from people born abroad.""The figures suggest that people born abroad account for 80% of the rise in employment - as Mr Duncan Smith says, more than three quarters. But the figure for the number of people born abroad includes UK nationals who were born in other countries.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces figures for non-UK nationals working in the UK, which suggests 56% of the increase in employment may be attributed to non-UK nationals.In the context of the referendum the broader point the Leave Campaign has been making is that there's been a big increase in the proportion of people working in the UK who are EU nationals.The proportion of UK workers who are non-UK EU nationals has indeed increased considerably. In the first three months of this year, about 6.8% of UK workers were non-UK EU nationals. Five years ago that figure was 4.5% and 10 years ago it was 2.6%. If you look at the numbers behind that, at the moment there are 2.15 million EU nationals working in the UK. Five years ago it was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-21,War of words,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36304729,"The EU referendum debate is rapidly turning into a festival of name-calling and insults. How did we get here?It all started out so well. David Cameron decided to allow members of his cabinet to campaign for either side in the EU referendum. Some argue he had no choice, given the likelihood of resignations. Others wondered how it would work, with big personalities like Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith having public disagreements with Mr Cameron and George Osborne one minute and then calmly putting aside their differences the next to get on with running the country. But both sides insisted they could be grown up about it.  ""We should all be big enough to have an honest and open, but polite disagreement, and then come back together again afterwards,"" said Mr Cameron.Announcing his decision to join the Leave campaign in February, Boris Johnson praised the PM's renegotiation attempts, and urged his divided Conservative colleagues to ""play the ball and not the man"". There was plenty of ill-feeling flying around before the debate proper got under way, with a bitter and personal row between the two rival Leave campaigns and mutterings from Eurosceptic backbenchers about how little they thought Mr Cameron had achieved in his renegotiations.But the big beasts managed to keep it relatively civil, with personal attacks couched in the coded language of Westminster. David Cameron's comments in the Commons, shortly after Boris Johnson joined the Leave camp, about having ""no other agenda than what is best for our country"" was interpreted as a jibe at the former London mayor's leadership ambitions. It was written up in the press as a ""war"" between the two men. Iain Duncan Smith may have resigned from the Cabinet over cuts to disability benefits in March's Budget - but it gave him freedom to say what he really thinks about David Cameron and George Osborne and their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. And he has not held back. He has been scathing about Mr Cameron's renegotiations, claiming he achieved ""nothing"", and has accused the Remain campaign of ""spin, smears and threats"" to try to ""bully"" Britons into voting to stay. He has also appealed for calm, warning that all the rows risk long-term damage to the Conservative Party.What has enraged the Leave camp, possibly more than anything else, is the way in which they think the prime minister has used the might of the government machine to rig the referendum debate in his favour. The government's decision, in April, to spend £9m on sending a glossy brochure to every household in the country led to loud cries of foul play. David Cameron said the government was entitled to state its case. But Boris Johnson claimed the PM had reneged on his promise to ""fight fair"" during the referendum because he was ""losing the argument"". The Treasury's analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit provoked an even more furious reaction from the Leavers, particularly when George Osborne accused them of being ""economically illiterate"". The former Mayor of London has been on vintage form during this campaign, dreaming up ever more inventive ways of trashing the Remain campaign, headed by his old friend and rival David Cameron.He has compared them to jeweller Gerald Ratner, who famously called his own products ""crap"". He has described the global leaders backing the Remain campaign as appearing in Downing Street ""hostage videos"".A visit to an underwear factory in Derbyshire proved to be a target rich environment for the ex-Mayor.He compared the EU to a ""badly designed undergarment"", shouted ""pants on fire"" at the Remain campaign, before unleashing the inevitable battle cry:  ""Knickers to all those who talk Britain down.""David Cameron has largely avoided slinging mud back at Boris, but another Old Etonian Conservative MP has stepped manfully into the breach. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill and ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, is not a fan of the former London mayor, it seems.When Mr Johnson penned an article referencing Barack Obama's ""part Kenyan"" ancestry, Sir Nicholas had this to say on LBC radio:  ""I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive.""Sir Nicholas has kept up the Boris-baiting on his Twitter account, calling him the ""unchallenged master of the self inflicted wound"" and branding his comments about Hitler and the EU ""absurd, desperate and outright offensive"".With Labour MPs and members overwhelmingly supportive of the Remain campaign, ""red on red"" attacks have been less frequent than the ""blue on blue"" variety.  But Jeremy Corbyn's previous Eurosceptic sentiments have not gone unnoticed by the Labour Leave campaign. Labour MP Kate Hoey suggested the Labour leader (motto ""straight talking, honest politics"") was being less than straight with his decision to embrace the Remain cause.She said Labour voters would ""see through"" him. ""We know first of all, that he doesn't really mean it, no matter how much he tries to pretend he does, and secondly, that it is not in the interest of the Labour movement,"" she told the BBC News channel.Mr Corbyn says he wants to stay in the EU to fight for social reforms and workers' rights.The prime minister's warning that peace could be at risk from an EU exit did not go down well with the Leave side. It was mocked by Boris Johnson, who said it was ""very curious"" that the prime minister had called a referendum on leaving the EU, only to warn us ""that World War III is about to break out unless we vote to remain"".The Leave campaign's constant refrain is that Remain are trying to scare voters into backing their side. They call it Project Fear.The Remain campaign, for its part, have tried to suggest the Leavers are a bunch of swivel-eyed conspiracy theorists.""The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster,"" said George Osborne last week, on a visit to Stansted airport with Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable.There is an old internet maxim, known as Godwin's Law, that states the longer a debate goes on the more likely it is that someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.It was Boris Johnson who proved it correct last week, when he compared the EU's efforts to unify Europe to Hitler's. This was the moment that turned simmering tensions into (apologies for mixing the metaphors) a full-blown firestorm.Lord Heseltine - a longstanding supporter of the EU - suggested that the strain of the campaign must be getting to Boris Johnson, causing him to lose his judgement, blasting Mr Johnson's Hitler article as ""preposterous"" and ""obscene"" and suggesting he is not fit be Tory leader.Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Lord Heseltine as a ""voice from the past"" and fellow Leave campaigner Steve Baker accused Downing Street of being behind ""vicious briefings"" against his side, as he called for an end to ""personal nastiness"".And that is where we are today, with Conservative MPs on all sides appealing for an end to ""blue-on-blue"" conflict as the civil war in their party appears to rage out of control.But at least one Tory Leave campaigner is taking the longer view. Jacob-Rees Mogg,  writing in the Financial Times has drawn parallels with Conservative splits over the Corn Laws in the 19th century.""The Tory party survived great splits when its discipline and structures were much less well founded than they are now. The EU referendum will decide the matter of Europe for a generation - and the party is united in all other important policy areas."""

2016-05-21,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.Lords chief whip - Lord Bassam of BrightonFormer leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.Shadow minister without portfolio - Jonathan Ashworth Labour shadow cabinet in fullThe Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband.

2016-05-22,Corbyn outlines 'new economics' vision,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36351149,"Labour will seek to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly, Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he set out his party's plans for the economy.Addressing activists, he called for a ""mixed economy of public and social enterprise... a private sector with a long-term private business commitment"".He said a Labour government would break from the ""failed economic orthodoxy"".Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesOsborne warns Brexit will hit house pricesAt Labour's ""state of the economy"" conference in west London, Mr Corbyn set out his desire to reform capitalism and said his party needed to ""deliver the new economy that this country needs"".""An economy that starts by tackling the grotesque levels of inequality within our society,"" went on Mr Corbyn. ""An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment.""Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  ""Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. ""A new economics.""He said: ""Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared.""By Chris Mason, BBC News political correspondentHaving survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch. Mr Corbyn called it ""a new economics"". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the ""fundamental business of reforming capitalism"".So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.No one can doubt their ambition: ""I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform,"" the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS. But to do that, they have to win the next general election.Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough so they can fight that election? And if they do, can Messrs Corbyn and McDonnell sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money. ""We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances,"" he said. Councils would be given the power to limit ""skyrocketing"" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people ""at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market"".The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.The ""local rent regulation"" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to ""pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords"", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was ""creating a bigger and better private rented sector"". ""These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent,"" she said."

2016-05-22,Osborne 'Pinocchio' on Brexit forecast,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36351310,"Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has compared George Osborne to ""Pinocchio"" over his claim that a vote to leave the EU would cause an economic shock to UK house prices.The chancellor earlier said that in the event of a vote for Brexit, by 2018, houses could be worth up to 18% less than if the UK voted to remain.But Mr Duncan Smith said the claim reminded him of ""the nose growing rather long"". Treasury analysis is due next week. Its report will suggest that two years after a Brexit vote, UK house prices could be between 10% and 18% lower than after a remain vote.""If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like,"" Mr Osborne said.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowG7 finance ministers also think a UK exit would cause a ""shock"" to the world economy.After two-day talks in Japan they said it would complicate the world economy alongside geopolitical conflict, terrorism and the refugee crisis.The International Monetary Fund last Friday also said Brexit could cause a ""sharp drop"" in house prices.But former Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, cast doubt on the chancellor's forecast, saying: ""When I heard that I did think of Pinocchio and the nose growing rather long here.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.He said Mr Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2010 because Treasury reports could not be trusted as ""they were always fiddled with by chancellors of the exchequer"". He also said that the Treasury had failed to predict either the recession or a November fall in tax receipts. ""Now what we have had is a whole series of Treasury reports telling us the world is going to end, we are going to end up with lower house prices, the economy is going to be bad,"" he said. ""Even the Treasury has to admit under their most pessimistic forecast, the British economy would continue to grow after we left the European Union. And, this report also says house prices would continue to grow. ""My point is very simple, they do not know.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonWith four and a bit weeks to go until referendum day, voters find themselves swimming in a murky ocean of questionable statistics. And when I say questionable, I'm being polite.August bodies and grand figures on both sides are making bold claims. And they are both guessing. So what's happening here? Each side is playing what it sees as its greatest hit. The let's stay in brigade talk about the economy. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.The let's get out brigade talk about immigration. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.There will be plenty more claims where these came from before you pick up that stubby little pencil in a draughty polling station.Mr Osborne earlier told the BBC an ""economic shock"" would follow a vote for Britain to leave the EU. ""In the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer,"" he said. ""That affects the value of people's homes. And at the same time, first-time buyers are hit because mortgage rates go up, and mortgages become more difficult to get. So it's a lose-lose situation.""Campaigners for Vote Leave have previously said that lower house prices would help first-time buyers and those in the rental market.Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable tweeted: ""Osborne on house prices. Surely big price fall good for affordability and economic balance. Stick to jobs and basic economics George.""On Thursday, estate agents claimed a Brexit would take about £2,200 off average house prices by 2018.Ratings agency Moody's also said curbing immigration would ease competition for housing, and slow down house price and rental inflation.Also on Saturday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged mothers to vote for the UK to stay in the EU for the sake of their children.He told a conference of left-of-centre think tank the Fabian Society: ""To mothers who are worried about the prospects for their children in the future and want to know where the jobs will come from, to people who feel that globalisation is a runaway train and it's out of control and uncontrollable, we've got to show that we can manage that in the public interest.""

2016-05-22,Staying in EU adds 5m to population - Gove,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36341206,"Staying in the EU could increase the UK's population by up to 5.23m by 2030, Vote Leave has claimed, putting the NHS under ""unsustainable"" pressure.Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the estimates were ""robust"" and voting to leave the EU would strengthen the NHS.He argued the National Living Wage was an extra ""pull factor"" for migrants. Remain campaigners say the 5m figure is ""absurd"" as it is based on five states joining the EU by 2020, which they say ""is not remotely on the cards"".Politics Live: Updates from the EU referendum campaignPrime Minister David Cameron has said it will be ""decades"" before Turkey joins the EU and there is no firm date for the accession of Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia.A document from Vote Leave says the EU's commitment to the free movement of people and the UK's new National Living Wage mean net migration from the EU to the UK will be between 170,000 and 430,000 a year - adding between 2.58m and 5.23m people to the UK population by 2030.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.The group calculates the NHS could have to contend with a new group of patients the size of ""four Birminghams"", and A&E demand could increase by up to 57%. Voting to leave could mean ""millions of pounds saved in ending EU contributions"" could be given to ""strengthen"" the NHS instead, Mr Gove said. ""Boris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear that the NHS will only face additional pressures. ""Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU into UK every year.""But the EU was committed to allowing five new countries to join, he said, whose citizens would ""inevitably"" be attracted to the UK: ""The idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable.""The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Read moreThe Office for National Statistics predicts that net migration to the UK - from countries across the world, not just the EU - will add up to just under three million by 2029.Vote Leave says the ONS has ""consistently underestimated the true level of migration"" in the past and there are ""strong reasons to doubt this forecast"".Mr Gove stood by the Vote Leave figures, describing them as ""robust and methodologically fair"" and denied abandoning the economic argument - which Vote Leave had been focused on at the start of the campaign - to concentrate on immigration. But the Remain campaign said it was ""absurd"" to base figures on five new EU states by 2020 and the UK could veto any new country joining, and apply restrictions on free movement for new EU states.They pointed to comments made by Vote Leave's Boris Johnson to LBC radio in March, when he said Turkey would not join the EU ""in the foreseeable future"" and the idea of 75 million Turks having visa-free travel was ""simply not on the cards"".Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is campaigning the UK to remain in the EU, said: ""I think these figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they're not designed to inform - they're designed to confuse.""And former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said: ""Wrecking the economy by leaving Europe would make our NHS weaker - and patients would pay the price.""These figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU's Single Market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people's wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a £36 billion black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service.""""Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.""Meanwhile European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Le Monde that Britain would have to accept being treated like an outsider if it votes to leave the EU. ""Deserters won't be welcomed with open arms,"" he said.""That is not a threat, but our relations will no longer be as they are today"".But UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker's ""whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels"" adding: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat.""And Vote Leave's Labour chair Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low."""

Last year Mr Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidential election, said many Muslims nursed a ""hatred"" towards America and a ban should be in force ""until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"". By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editorWhile it is true that hopefuls like Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio met the prime-minister when they were passing through London - that was before they had declared they were candidates for the Republican nomination. A senior source said the PM would be happy to see Mr Trump once he becomes the official nominee - that will happen after the Republican Convention in July. Four years ago the then Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, visited Downing Street - and caused consternation when he criticised Britain's preparedness for hosting the London 2012 Olympics. Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: ""I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him.""Downing Street has since said the PM stands by his criticism of but will work with whoever is elected US president.Donald Trump's reality TV playbookKissing Kissinger and other Trump pivotsNevada chaos should worry DemocratsIn an interview with US news channel MSNBC, Mr Trump said: ""I will do just fine with David Cameron.

2016-05-22,Two Britons lose EU vote legal bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36341839,"Two Britons living abroad have lost their Court of Appeal battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.The challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan, 54.Under law, UK citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote. The pair took the case to the Court of Appeal after losing their application for a judicial review last month. Mr Shindler and Ms MacLennan had argued the in-out vote on EU membership, on 23 June, directly affected them and brought the test case on behalf of others in their situation.In April, they asked High Court judges to declare that section two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established ""the 15-year rule"", unlawfully acted as a penalty for their having exercised their rights to free movement.But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.They then took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a one-day hearing took place earlier this month. Three appeal judges - Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King - upheld the High Court decision on Friday, declaring the rule did not unlawfully interfere with the right of expats to freedom of movement within the European Union.EU campaign latestEU vote: All you need to knowUK stars back remaining in EUStudents risk missing voteLord Dyson said: ""The claimants say that their exclusion from the franchise is an unjustified restriction on their EU right - EU law right - of free movement and contrary to their constitutional, common law right to vote. ""The appeals against the dismissal of their claims is dismissed. The court holds first that the 2015 Act does not fall within the scope of EU law at all, so that the claim fails at the first hurdle.""He added that ""the common law right to vote does not take precedence over an Act of Parliament"" and refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The expats still have the right to ask Supreme Court judges to consider the case, however. Their lawyers said a hearing had been listed for Tuesday, at which permission to appeal - as well as the substance of the appeal itself - would be considered.Those eligible can register to vote here.The non-Britons who get an EU voteMs McLennan, who is originally from Inverness but has lived in Brussels since 1987, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The refusal to allow me and others in my situation to vote is an infringement of my EU rights.""She added that the result of the vote ""would have a huge impact"" on both her personal and professional life, and that she often returned to the UK to visit her parents and children, and for work. ""I feel very strongly that I ought to have a fundamental democratic right to vote in my country of citizenship,"" said Ms McLennan.Mr Shindler, appointed an MBE for Anglo-Italian relations in 2014, has been told he has ""diminished or diluted"" links to the UK after living abroad for so long. He has lived in Italy for 35 years. The UK passport holder, originally from London, said: ""The fact that we don't live there doesn't alter that fact, we were born British and we will remain that way. ""If we go and live somewhere else, it doesn't make us anything else. They work out here. People don't know who these expats are you know, think they're all on holiday.""He also said the government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed.Law firm Leigh Day, which represents the pair, argued that up to two million British citizens were being unlawfully denied the right to vote on membership of the EU."
2016-05-22,Care 'could suffer' as NHS busts budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36341235,"Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out. Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"".""We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care.""The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service. There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS ""could not be bleaker"".""The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.""There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.""Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black holeFinancial problems 'endemic in the NHS'Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Nearly nine in 10 hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterTaken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was ""cooking up accounting alchemy"" by ""turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury"". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎""We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff,"" he added.The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published."
2016-05-22,Scores of UK stars back remaining in EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36338220,"Jude Law, Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch are among stars who have signed a letter saying Brexit would ""damage"" the creative industry.Almost 300 actors, musicians, writers and artists are backing calls for the UK to stay in the EU.They say ""vital EU funding"" and work across borders has been key to projects from galleries to blockbusters.But House of Cards author Lord Dobbs said British success in the industry was ""not because of the EU"".Among others backing the letter are actors Bill Nighy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sir John Hurt, Sir Patrick Stewart and Thandie Newton, architect Richard Rogers, artist Tracey Emin, author John le Carre, comedian Jo Brand, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, director Richard Curtis and writer Philip Pullman.The letter, organised by the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, says: ""Britain is not just stronger in Europe, it is more imaginative and more creative, and our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away.""It adds: ""Leaving Europe would be a leap into the unknown for millions of people across the UK who work in the creative industries, and for the millions more at home and abroad who benefit from the growth and vibrancy of Britain's cultural sector.""""We believe that being part of the EU bolsters Britain's leading role on the world stage. Let's not become an outsider shouting from the wings.""The Stronger In campaign says that more than 2.2 million people are employed in the UK's creative industries and digital sector. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.It argues that the creative and digital industries export billions of pounds of services to the EU and are among the fastest-growing sectors of the UK economy.Prime Minister David Cameron met some of the stars campaigning for Remain at a visit to the famous Abbey Road studios in London, with former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell.Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign, said leaving the EU would mean higher tariffs on exports and digital and creative industries were ""better off with the UK in EU"" with access to the single market.But speaking in a personal capacity, the Conservative peer and author Lord Dobbs, said: ""Our creative industries are booming because of the talent that is in Britain's DNA. ""We are world leaders in so many creative areas. From theatre to literature, video games, feature films, fashion, music and so much else, British artists lead the way and are celebrated around the globe. ""It's a success that has been created by the dedication, hard work and extraordinary creative abilities of our artists, it's not because of the EU."" He added: ""Culture owes nothing to committees. ""Ancient Greece was the birthplace of our civilisation yet today, because of the EU's appalling policies, streets that were once filled with the world's greatest philosophers and playwrights are choked with desperate beggars and mountains of rotting rubbish. ""These are the realities of the EU. It's failing. The dream is dead. We need to move on.""Conservative Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he did not think people should be ""swayed by celebrities"".Meanwhile Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has entered the debate, warning that Canada's own trade deal with the EU had taken more than ten years to negotiate and was yet to enter force.""There's nothing easy or automatic about that,"" he said.""Britain is always going to have clout, it's just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU. I believe we're always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn't seem to be a productive path for countries.""The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has defended Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's intervention in the debate last week, when he warned that a vote to leave could cause a recession.Mr Trichet told BBC's This Week's World there was an ""obligation"" for the central bank to ""say candidly what they see"".Those behind the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union said Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the risks of Brexit. Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC he ""wouldn't expect"" a major financial institution to back the Leave campaign ""because they all wanted to protect the status quo"".And Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, has described ""this daily avalanche of institutional propaganda"" as ""ludicrous and pitiful"".

2016-05-22,MP brands voter 'a horrible racist',https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-36334488,"A Labour MP campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU has apologised after being recorded calling a voter a ""horrible racist"".Shadow Europe minister Pat Glass made the comments after an interview with BBC Radio Derby in Sawley, Derbyshire.She said: ""The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.Updates on this story and more from DerbyshireThe man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them. ""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"". ""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this."" Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""But she accused Leave campaigners of offering ""false promises"" that if the UK left the EU there would be a ""substantial"" change on migration policy."
2016-05-22,Cameron heads off EU trade deal revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36332415,"Downing Street has headed off a revolt over the Queen's Speech by saying it will accept a move to exclude the NHS from a controversial EU-US trade deal. Tory rebels were threatening to join Labour and the SNP to back an amendment ""regretting"" the lack of a bill to protect the NHS from the TTIP deal.But Downing Street has denied them the chance by saying they will back it.One of the MPs tabling the amendment, Labour's Paula Sherriff, described it as a ""humiliating climbdown"" by the PM.""They will now be the first government in history to officially 'regret' their own programme within days of announcing it, just months after doing the same on their Budget,"" she said.Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Steve Baker MP said: ""The government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.""But a spokesman for Number 10 said: ""As we've said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this amendment is selected, we'll accept it.""Also on Thursday, David Cameron told LBC radio  he did not want the EU referendum to become a ""Tory psycho-drama"" involving him and senior ""Leave"" Conservatives Boris Johnson and Michael Gove but claimed former London mayor Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a leaver"". He also described himself as a Eurosceptic but said he believed it was better that the UK remain in the EU.Mr Johnson, in response, said he had been a ""Eurosceptic for decades"" and said: ""I urge my friends in government to recognise that in all logic, and as self-declared Eurosceptics, they should really be campaigning with us on this side of the argument.""The TTIP amendment - signed by 25 Tory MPs - expressed regret that the government has not brought forward a bill to protect the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, currently being negotiated between the EU and the US. Although it would have been a purely symbolic vote, no government has suffered a defeat on a Queen's Speech, which sets out its legislative programme for the year ahead, since 1924.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long opposed TTIP, had said he would back the Conservative rebels.It is understood the SNP and other minority parties were also likely to support the amendment.Sources in the Vote Leave campaign predicted the government had faced defeat unless it backed down.Conservative former minister Peter Lilley, who supported the amendment, said that although he supports free trade, TTIP would introduce ""special courts which are not necessary for free trade, will give American multinationals the right to sue our government (but not vice versa) and could put our NHS at risk"".TTIP is primarily a deal to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade between the US and EU countries, making it potentially easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other's markets.Industries it would affect include pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing and food and drink.The government says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars.In the UK, attention has focused on the potential impact on the NHS, with critics saying TTIP would allow private firms running NHS services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector.What is the future for UK-US trade?Labour MP Frank Field, who backed the amendment, said: ""We can't have kangaroo courts, operating only to America's advantage, deciding how we should trade in respect of the NHS.""SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: ""The SNP have been at the forefront of the campaign to protect the NHS and other public services from the potential consequences of TTIP, and so we welcome any opportunity to ensure that the Tory government keep the promises they have already made.""But former Labour minister Rachel Reeves, writing on the Labour List website, said: ""Those who want Britain to leave the EU need to stop preying on British peoples' love for the NHS by cynically pretending that TTIP poses a threat. It does not. ""They are demeaning their own campaign by arguing a case they know to be untrue.""But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who like Ms Reeves is backing the Remain campaign, said she would vote for the amendment.She said: ""If we left the EU, then we could be left with the government negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. What then? ""With the Tories still in charge, we could then expect the roll out of multiple TTIPs on steroids as Britain negotiated trade deals with countries across the world."""
2016-05-22,Lib Dem cabinet post welcomed by Farron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36335307,"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has welcomed Kirsty Williams's plan to be education secretary in an otherwise all Labour Welsh Government.  Mr Farron said she would ""retain her independence"" and aim to make education in Wales ""markedly better"" then in the rest of the UK. Ms Williams's appointment is subject to a vote of Welsh Lib Dem members at a special conference on Saturday.She has said she is not taking party support on the matter for granted.The AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, who boosted her majority over the Conservatives at the assembly election to more than 8,000, was named by First Minister Carwyn Jones on Thursday as part of an eight-member cabinet.Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme on Friday, Mr Farron said Ms Williams's cabinet role would be ""great news for education in Wales"". ""Kirsty has that great strength of somebody with great experience of education, the mother of three children who are in Welsh state schools, and somebody who's very committed to making a difference."" Mr Farron said he was ""very impressed"" with the ""hard achievements"" the Liberal Democrats would get out of the agreement with Labour.""But my aim is, and Kirsty's aim will be, that education in Wales will be markedly better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of Kirsty and the Liberal Democrats' involvement in this administration."" Asked if she was confident of getting her party's support, the former Welsh Lib Dem leader said: ""I never take anything for granted in politics.""The great thing about being a member of the Welsh Liberal Democrats [is that] it's not up to individuals to make these choices. ""Every single member of our party will have an opportunity to have their say and have a vote on this decision.""Ms Williams denied her appointment would effectively mean her party ceased to exist in the assembly.""It exists with a cabinet minister, hopefully subject to the party agreement, being able to implement Welsh Liberal Democrat policies and influencing the agenda,"" she said.""That's a lot stronger than being a single assembly member on a backbench.""Ms Williams said she would never leave her party, and did not think Labour, Plaid and the Welsh Liberal Democrats should merge or have a formal relationship.""There are different traditions and political strands that are represented by each of the parties.""What is important is that we look to work where we can together and recognise that the way in which politics happens in Wales is changing.""It isn't about one single party driving home their manifesto without due reference to other voices.""The deal between Ms Williams and Labour agrees a list of nine common priorities which include pledges from the Welsh Lib Dem election manifesto, such as:It also calls for the upcoming recommendations of the Diamond Review into student finance to be considered ""with a view to early implementation where appropriate"" but with no ""negative effect"" on the higher education budget.The Lib Dem tuition fee policy at the election was to end tuition fee support grants that students currently get. The party proposed to replace it with a student living support grant funded by the other grant's withdrawal - but this is not written into the agreement.Ms Williams was the only opposition AM to back Mr Jones in the first deadlocked vote for first minister - despite Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP supporting Plaid leader Leanne Wood.Mr Jones was later reinstated after he came to an agreement with Plaid Cymru - although no members of that party were appointed to his cabinet.Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said it is unlikely all the policies in the agreement between Ms Williams and Welsh Labour will get support of parties outside the government.He said on Twitter: ""Important to note these policies will need opposition support to be implemented. Unlikely that all will succeed.""The senior Plaid figure also questioned the Lib Dems' pledge in the agreement to reduce infant class sizes to 25.He said that ""most evidence suggests you need to reduce to 15 to have any real effect. Reducing to 25 is costly but ineffective"".Meanwhile UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said Ms Williams should resign her seat and seek a fresh mandate in a by-election.He said: ""When UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless left their old parties, they did the honourable thing and went back to their electors at a by-election to seek a new mandate to represent them.""Kirsty is now duty bound to support Labour 100% over this five-year assembly term. ""I call on her to take the same honourable course and seek a fresh mandate from her constituents because, in all but name, she has now become a Labour AM."" "
2016-05-22,Students risk missing referendum vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36303347,"UK university students believe the EU referendum is key to their future, but almost two-thirds do not know when it is, suggests research. And a third of more than 2,000 students questioned feared being unable to get to their polling station on the day. The referendum, on 23 June, is outside term time, so many students will need to re-register at their home address, says the National Union of Students. NUS vice-president Richard Brooks urged students ""to think ahead"". ""The EU referendum is a once-in-a-generation vote,"" said Mr Brooks. ""The decision made on the 23 June will impact young people and students the most, as they are the ones that will live with the consequences for the longest.""If students don't want their future decided for them, it is essential that as many as possible get out and vote.""Mr Brooks urged students to think about where they would be on referendum day and to make sure they register or re-register at the right address. ""If they are unsure about where they will be, students can register at both their term-time and home address, providing they only vote once,"" he said.""If they are going to be on holiday or are heading to Glastonbury, they should apply for a postal vote.""People had until 17:00 on 7 June to register if they wanted to vote in the referendum, he added. It is also possible to apply for a postal or proxy vote by 17:00 on 8 June. The interviews, carried out this month on a representative sample of students from across the UK by YouthSight for Universities UK, found: Universities UK and the Association of Colleges are holding voter registration drives at institutions across the UK. Students will be advised to register, re-register or apply for proxy or postal votes, according to their circumstances. UUK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said it was of ""real concern"" that so many students were unaware of the referendum date and that they might have to re-register to vote at another address. ""From this week, universities will be scaling up their efforts to encourage students to register to vote, and to make sure they do so in the right location,"" she said.""With nearly two million UK students eligible to vote in the referendum, it is vital that they have all the necessary information to make sure they can take part in this hugely important decision."""

A Downing Street spokesman said ""we don't accept"" Mr Baker's claims. In other EU referendum campaign developments:The government is campaigning for a vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum and Prime Minister David Cameron, whose party is divided on the issue, has previously called for a ""respectful"" debate. But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate ""breathtakingly disheartening"".Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in ""Downing Street hostage videos"".Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended ""into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people"".He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as ""economically illiterate"" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his ""preposterous, obscene"" remarks.""I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,"" said Mr Baker.Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as ""from the past"" following his intervention.Mr Baker claimed there had been ""intolerable media smears"" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: ""It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.""He added: ""If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign ""can't make an honest and positive case"" because they ""know it's a losing argument"".""So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,"" he said. He added: ""What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't accept Steve Baker's article.""All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.""The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: ""Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.""In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based ""employees worse off"".Writing in The Times, he warned financial jobs could leave London for Paris or Frankfurt and said ""a vote to leave is a risk""."

2016-05-22,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"The referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union, or remain a member, is on 23 June. So far, opinion polls suggest the campaign has had little impact on voters. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes assesses what the polls may be telling us.Read the full methodologyThere's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months. The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters. That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention. Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote. ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-22,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.

Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-22,Resident rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36316467,"It might seem peculiar that a young Australian here in Britain on a two-year working holiday is allowed to have a say on whether the UK should leave the European Union. But Michael Ingle, a 27-year-old physiotherapist living in Surrey, defends his right to participate in the 23 June referendum.He says that as a taxpayer, and a citizen of the Commonwealth, what happens to Britain is important to him and will have ramifications for the wider world well beyond the cliffs of Dover.""It's not just about Britain for me, which is why I've taken an interest in it,"" Mr Ingle, from Sydney, says.""It's about the West and the stability of this continent.""As a hangover from the days of empire, when so-called ""British subjects"" were included in the parliamentary franchise, Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK without British nationality retain the right to vote in elections.Estimates based on the 2011 census put the number of Commonwealth citizens eligible to vote in the forthcoming referendum at between 894,000 and more than 960,000.They join Irish citizens as the only non-Brits allowed to vote in what David Cameron has called a ""once in a generation"" decision. This has drawn the ire of groups including Migration Watch UK.Its chair, Lord Green of Deddington, says that ""important decisions about Britain should be taken by those who are British citizens and only by them"".A petition to parliament signed by more than 40,000 people, meanwhile, has claimed that allowing non-Brits to vote would bias the result towards the Remain side, especially given that the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta are also in the EU.But regardless of whether one agrees with the voting rules, such claims treat Commonwealth voters as a homogenous bloc of sorts, destined to vote in the same way.This obscures the fact that Commonwealth citizens living in Britain come from a diverse range of 53 countries in all the world's time zones.Voters of even the same age and nationality can have vastly different views on the subject at hand.Take Farhan Samsudin and Zila Fawzi, two young Malaysian women living in London.Farhan, who works in banking, says she will vote Remain on 23 June, despite what she says is the failure of either campaign to provide information on how the ""Commonwealth constituency"" might be affected by the result.She thinks the UK should strengthen its economic ties with Asian economies like Malaysia and sees membership of the EU as an obstacle in trade negotiations.Yet, with no clear plans presented to her on how a post-EU Britain would approach the world, she says she'll vote to stay.Zila, on the other hand, who is on a British government-funded scholarship, supports an EU exit.Her vote will be pinned on hopes that immigration policy will change in a way that benefits Commonwealth citizens if the UK no longer has to abide by free movement within the EU.""Once they are out of the EU it would be easier, especially for us Malaysians, to come and work here,"" she says.A postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, Zila is frustrated by the fact that any EU citizen is allowed to work in the UK, while highly educated Commonwealth citizens like her are turned away.On this point, Farhan chimes in.""The British government sponsors brilliant minds like her but they don't give any leeway for her to work here,"" she says, shaking her head. ""It's a real waste.""Avenues for Commonwealth citizens to migrate to the UK have become increasingly slim since the abolishment of working holiday visas (now limited to just a handful of countries under the Youth Mobility Scheme) and the post-study work visa, which allowed students to stay on for two years after the end of their course.Foreign students from outside the EU, many of whom are from the Commonwealth, now have just four months to find a job if they want to stay.The recent introduction of a £35,000 income threshold for non-EU skilled workers to settle in the UK in a bid to reduce net migration has led to further frustration and the spectre of mass deportations.Yet, while it would seem as though pro-Brexit campaigners could capitalise on the prickly issue of immigration in order to draw Commonwealth voters to their side, the issue is not so clear-cut.Given that some of the constituencies that the Leave campaign are courting harbour anti-immigrant sentiment, making a pitch to Commonwealth voters to back an EU exit based on immigration potential could see it take a hit elsewhere, says Ralph Buckle, director of the Commonwealth Exchange think tank.""Everyone has this number of what they think the right level of immigration is. It depends whether that number is high enough to include an increase [from] the Commonwealth.""The government's target of getting net migration under 100,000 annually also hovers ominously over any suggestion that more places could go to Commonwealth citizens if Brexit eventuated.The official Vote Leave campaign has said Britain could have a ""fairer"" migration policy that would ""make it easier for some to come, such as scientists and job-creators"" if the UK left the EU.In February Vote Leave published a letter to David Cameron from community and business leaders with Commonwealth links criticising immigration policy.""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom,"" they said.But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, speaking for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said that leaving the EU in order to end free movement would hurt everyone in Britain economically, including Commonwealth citizens.""Commonwealth citizens living in the UK benefit from jobs, lower prices and financial security we get from being part of the world's largest single market.""Commonwealth countries around the world, from Australia to Jamaica, are urging us to stay in the EU,"" he said.In a newspaper article last August, Lord Howell, chairman of Commonwealth Exchange and a former Conservative minister, said the polarity of the EU question was ""maddeningly oversimplified"" for internationally-minded Commonwealth citizens.He said the Leave campaign could not fall back on a ""little England mantra"", while the Remain camp would have to move away from ""seeing the continent as the UK's only future"".Mark Sultana, a 48-year-old long-time UK resident who organises events for fellow Canadians living in London, sees both sides of the picture.While he bemoans ""all the wastage and all the subsidies"" of the EU, he fears financial instability and losing the right to retire on the continent.""The whole thing is so complicated,"" he says.""I think ultimately even though I'm so anti all these things, so many things that the EU stands for… from the point of view of economic stability, the fact you're in it and that the world should be [becoming] a smaller place not a bigger place… [I would vote with] a grudging and qualified yes.""Mark also points out that the immigration argument means different things for different Commonwealth citizens.Canadians who live in the UK by virtue of European ancestry like himself, for example, might be fearful of losing that right in the case of a Brexit.""For that generation of that ilk, who came here, the European Union is very important. If you have Brexit there's a whole lot of people who would have trouble coming here.""For Brad Argent, meanwhile, having to deal with UK visa hassles despite being married to an English woman makes him feel like ""a second-class citizen"".The 50-year-old Australian, who works for an internet business, needs to wait for five years to get residency.""Whereas if I'm from Europe I can just come over on the train and set up house,"" he says outside Australia's High Commission on the Strand in London, where he has come to renew his passport.But Brad won't carry his these grievances to the ballot box, least of all because he does not want his British children to lose the right to work in the continent.""I think a vote to leave just out of spite because I'm a member of the Commonwealth, whilst that might feel good for about five minutes, I think the longer term implications I would start to regret,"" he says.With Commonwealth migrants unlikely to vote as a uniform bloc due to their divergent interests and circumstances, it appears either camp could still make a pitch to this 'constituency', which has largely been ignored in the debate thus far.After all, a million votes are at stake."
2016-05-22,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36345081,"The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Justice Secretary Michael Gove has unveiled Vote Leave's research on the effect free movement will have on the National Health Service.The document makes broad predictions, but even so, some of the assumptions it makes are questionable.The lower end of the forecast, that EU migration will rise by 2.58 million by 2030, is based on taking the most recent ONS net migration figure and multiplying it by 15.But the ONS actually produces a forecast for total net migration by 2029 (so not just from the EU), which it expects to have added 3 million to the population by then.Now there are uncertainties surrounding all forecasts, but it makes the bottom end of Vote Leave's forecast look somewhat high by comparison.To get to the higher ends of the forecast, the research assumes that all five current candidate countries wanting to join the EU (Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and FYR Macedonia) do so in 2020. This is very unlikely to happen. You can read more about why Turkey in particular is not going to join the EU by 2020 here. They also assume no transitional controls to limit migration from the new members. Existing states are allowed to impose seven years of restrictions to freedom of movement from new members, as the UK did with Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.Add to that the impact of the new National Living Wage and you get to Vote Leave's ""high"" forecast of 5.23 million. The quote from Michael Gove above is supposed to illustrate the ""medium"" forecast, which excludes the effect of the National Living Wage to get to a figure of 4.25 million. The population of Birmingham is about 1.1 million.It is hard to completely discount any forecast. Even so, the line about four Birminghams is hard to justify based on these such assumptions.From the figures on the growing population, the research gets to a figure on the extra demand from A&E departments, concluding that it would lead to an increase in demand of between 28% and 57%.It has reached these figures by looking at increases in A&E attendance since 2002 and noting a strong correlation with cumulative net migration over that time. In other words, attendances to A&E went up quickly at a time when there was continuous net migration to the UK.This relationship is then used to predict how future migration would affect demand for A&E.The problem is that while demand for A&E has gone up at the same time as there has been migration, the research has not demonstrated that one has caused the other.While it is clearly true that higher numbers of migrants would mean more A&E visits, it could be that A&E attendances have gone up for other reasons as well, so the relationship is not reliable.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-22,House of Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36330992,"It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that ""my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons"", she was signalling a retreat. Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers. A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits. Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention -  an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation. Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions. Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.Government to review Lords powers after tax credits defeatLimiting Lords powers 'calls its future into question'It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords. ""We're defeating the government more often than is good for us,"" a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?807Peers247 Conservative 211 Labour 175 Crossbench 109 Liberal Democrat Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation. My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight. 650Members of Parliament330 Conservative 229 Labour 54 SNP 8 Liberal Democrat ""There's no point in us existing,"" he told me, ""if we don't vote for the things we believe in.""That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened. In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems;  in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247. Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election. ""The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords,"" he says.Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place. ""It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is,"" says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a ""spurious"" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time. He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake. The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.""We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event,"" he said.David Cameron's real problem isn't peers, Lib Dem or otherwise. It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled. Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government. It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem. "
2016-05-22,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36333410,"The claim: Iain Duncan Smith says that more than three quarters of the rise in employment in the last year has come from people born abroad.Reality Check verdict: The latest figures support this. You could also look at the number of non-UK nationals (rather than everyone born abroad, which includes British citizens). They account for 56% of the rise.Responding to the latest unemployment figures, Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: ""Our labour market is thriving, but it's notable that more than three quarters of the rise in employment over the last year has come from people born abroad.""The figures suggest that people born abroad account for 80% of the rise in employment - as Mr Duncan Smith says, more than three quarters. But the figure for the number of people born abroad includes UK nationals who were born in other countries.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces figures for non-UK nationals working in the UK, which suggests 56% of the increase in employment may be attributed to non-UK nationals.In the context of the referendum the broader point the Leave Campaign has been making is that there's been a big increase in the proportion of people working in the UK who are EU nationals.The proportion of UK workers who are non-UK EU nationals has indeed increased considerably. In the first three months of this year, about 6.8% of UK workers were non-UK EU nationals. Five years ago that figure was 4.5% and 10 years ago it was 2.6%. If you look at the numbers behind that, at the moment there are 2.15 million EU nationals working in the UK. Five years ago it was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-22,War of words,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36304729,"The EU referendum debate is rapidly turning into a festival of name-calling and insults. How did we get here?It all started out so well. David Cameron decided to allow members of his cabinet to campaign for either side in the EU referendum. Some argue he had no choice, given the likelihood of resignations. Others wondered how it would work, with big personalities like Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith having public disagreements with Mr Cameron and George Osborne one minute and then calmly putting aside their differences the next to get on with running the country. But both sides insisted they could be grown up about it.  ""We should all be big enough to have an honest and open, but polite disagreement, and then come back together again afterwards,"" said Mr Cameron.Announcing his decision to join the Leave campaign in February, Boris Johnson praised the PM's renegotiation attempts, and urged his divided Conservative colleagues to ""play the ball and not the man"". There was plenty of ill-feeling flying around before the debate proper got under way, with a bitter and personal row between the two rival Leave campaigns and mutterings from Eurosceptic backbenchers about how little they thought Mr Cameron had achieved in his renegotiations.But the big beasts managed to keep it relatively civil, with personal attacks couched in the coded language of Westminster. David Cameron's comments in the Commons, shortly after Boris Johnson joined the Leave camp, about having ""no other agenda than what is best for our country"" was interpreted as a jibe at the former London mayor's leadership ambitions. It was written up in the press as a ""war"" between the two men. Iain Duncan Smith may have resigned from the Cabinet over cuts to disability benefits in March's Budget - but it gave him freedom to say what he really thinks about David Cameron and George Osborne and their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. And he has not held back. He has been scathing about Mr Cameron's renegotiations, claiming he achieved ""nothing"", and has accused the Remain campaign of ""spin, smears and threats"" to try to ""bully"" Britons into voting to stay. He has also appealed for calm, warning that all the rows risk long-term damage to the Conservative Party.What has enraged the Leave camp, possibly more than anything else, is the way in which they think the prime minister has used the might of the government machine to rig the referendum debate in his favour. The government's decision, in April, to spend £9m on sending a glossy brochure to every household in the country led to loud cries of foul play. David Cameron said the government was entitled to state its case. But Boris Johnson claimed the PM had reneged on his promise to ""fight fair"" during the referendum because he was ""losing the argument"". The Treasury's analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit provoked an even more furious reaction from the Leavers, particularly when George Osborne accused them of being ""economically illiterate"". The former Mayor of London has been on vintage form during this campaign, dreaming up ever more inventive ways of trashing the Remain campaign, headed by his old friend and rival David Cameron.He has compared them to jeweller Gerald Ratner, who famously called his own products ""crap"". He has described the global leaders backing the Remain campaign as appearing in Downing Street ""hostage videos"".A visit to an underwear factory in Derbyshire proved to be a target rich environment for the ex-Mayor.He compared the EU to a ""badly designed undergarment"", shouted ""pants on fire"" at the Remain campaign, before unleashing the inevitable battle cry:  ""Knickers to all those who talk Britain down.""David Cameron has largely avoided slinging mud back at Boris, but another Old Etonian Conservative MP has stepped manfully into the breach. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill and ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, is not a fan of the former London mayor, it seems.When Mr Johnson penned an article referencing Barack Obama's ""part Kenyan"" ancestry, Sir Nicholas had this to say on LBC radio:  ""I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive.""Sir Nicholas has kept up the Boris-baiting on his Twitter account, calling him the ""unchallenged master of the self inflicted wound"" and branding his comments about Hitler and the EU ""absurd, desperate and outright offensive"".With Labour MPs and members overwhelmingly supportive of the Remain campaign, ""red on red"" attacks have been less frequent than the ""blue on blue"" variety.  But Jeremy Corbyn's previous Eurosceptic sentiments have not gone unnoticed by the Labour Leave campaign. Labour MP Kate Hoey suggested the Labour leader (motto ""straight talking, honest politics"") was being less than straight with his decision to embrace the Remain cause.She said Labour voters would ""see through"" him. ""We know first of all, that he doesn't really mean it, no matter how much he tries to pretend he does, and secondly, that it is not in the interest of the Labour movement,"" she told the BBC News channel.Mr Corbyn says he wants to stay in the EU to fight for social reforms and workers' rights.The prime minister's warning that peace could be at risk from an EU exit did not go down well with the Leave side. It was mocked by Boris Johnson, who said it was ""very curious"" that the prime minister had called a referendum on leaving the EU, only to warn us ""that World War III is about to break out unless we vote to remain"".The Leave campaign's constant refrain is that Remain are trying to scare voters into backing their side. They call it Project Fear.The Remain campaign, for its part, have tried to suggest the Leavers are a bunch of swivel-eyed conspiracy theorists.""The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster,"" said George Osborne last week, on a visit to Stansted airport with Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable.There is an old internet maxim, known as Godwin's Law, that states the longer a debate goes on the more likely it is that someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.It was Boris Johnson who proved it correct last week, when he compared the EU's efforts to unify Europe to Hitler's. This was the moment that turned simmering tensions into (apologies for mixing the metaphors) a full-blown firestorm.Lord Heseltine - a longstanding supporter of the EU - suggested that the strain of the campaign must be getting to Boris Johnson, causing him to lose his judgement, blasting Mr Johnson's Hitler article as ""preposterous"" and ""obscene"" and suggesting he is not fit be Tory leader.Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Lord Heseltine as a ""voice from the past"" and fellow Leave campaigner Steve Baker accused Downing Street of being behind ""vicious briefings"" against his side, as he called for an end to ""personal nastiness"".And that is where we are today, with Conservative MPs on all sides appealing for an end to ""blue-on-blue"" conflict as the civil war in their party appears to rage out of control.But at least one Tory Leave campaigner is taking the longer view. Jacob-Rees Mogg,  writing in the Financial Times has drawn parallels with Conservative splits over the Corn Laws in the 19th century.""The Tory party survived great splits when its discipline and structures were much less well founded than they are now. The EU referendum will decide the matter of Europe for a generation - and the party is united in all other important policy areas."""

2016-05-22,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.Shadow Lords leader - Baroness Smith of BasildonThe Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.Lords chief whip - Lord Bassam of BrightonFormer leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.Shadow minister without portfolio - Jonathan Ashworth Labour shadow cabinet in fullThe Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband.

The Wentworth and Dearne held a range of post during the Labour government, including financial secretary to the Treasury and local government minister.Shadow attorney general - Karl TurnerThe MP for Hull East took over the role of Labour's chief legal adviser after the resignation of Catherine McKinnell.

""An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment.""Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  ""Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. ""A new economics.""He said: ""Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared.""By Chris Mason, BBC News political correspondentHaving survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch. Mr Corbyn called it ""a new economics"". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the ""fundamental business of reforming capitalism"".So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.No one can doubt their ambition: ""I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform,"" the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS. But to do that, they have to win the next general election.Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough so they can fight that election? And if they do, can Messrs Corbyn and McDonnell sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money. ""We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances,"" he said. Councils would be given the power to limit ""skyrocketing"" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people ""at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market"".The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.The ""local rent regulation"" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to ""pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords"", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was ""creating a bigger and better private rented sector"". ""These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent,"" she said."

Treasury analysis is due next week. Its report will suggest that two years after a Brexit vote, UK house prices could be between 10% and 18% lower than after a remain vote.""If we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like,"" Mr Osborne said.Labour attacks 'skyrocketing' rent risesThe UK's EU vote: All you need to knowG7 finance ministers also think a UK exit would cause a ""shock"" to the world economy.After two-day talks in Japan they said it would complicate the world economy alongside geopolitical conflict, terrorism and the refugee crisis.The International Monetary Fund last Friday also said Brexit could cause a ""sharp drop"" in house prices.But former Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, cast doubt on the chancellor's forecast, saying: ""When I heard that I did think of Pinocchio and the nose growing rather long here.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.He said Mr Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2010 because Treasury reports could not be trusted as ""they were always fiddled with by chancellors of the exchequer"". He also said that the Treasury had failed to predict either the recession or a November fall in tax receipts. ""Now what we have had is a whole series of Treasury reports telling us the world is going to end, we are going to end up with lower house prices, the economy is going to be bad,"" he said. ""Even the Treasury has to admit under their most pessimistic forecast, the British economy would continue to grow after we left the European Union. And, this report also says house prices would continue to grow. ""My point is very simple, they do not know.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonWith four and a bit weeks to go until referendum day, voters find themselves swimming in a murky ocean of questionable statistics. And when I say questionable, I'm being polite.August bodies and grand figures on both sides are making bold claims. And they are both guessing. So what's happening here? Each side is playing what it sees as its greatest hit. The let's stay in brigade talk about the economy. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.The let's get out brigade talk about immigration. The more grabby the headline, the more people who will notice.There will be plenty more claims where these came from before you pick up that stubby little pencil in a draughty polling station.Mr Osborne earlier told the BBC an ""economic shock"" would follow a vote for Britain to leave the EU. ""In the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer,"" he said. ""That affects the value of people's homes. And at the same time, first-time buyers are hit because mortgage rates go up, and mortgages become more difficult to get. So it's a lose-lose situation.""Campaigners for Vote Leave have previously said that lower house prices would help first-time buyers and those in the rental market.Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable tweeted: ""Osborne on house prices. Surely big price fall good for affordability and economic balance. Stick to jobs and basic economics George.""On Thursday, estate agents claimed a Brexit would take about £2,200 off average house prices by 2018.Ratings agency Moody's also said curbing immigration would ease competition for housing, and slow down house price and rental inflation.Also on Saturday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged mothers to vote for the UK to stay in the EU for the sake of their children.He told a conference of left-of-centre think tank the Fabian Society: ""To mothers who are worried about the prospects for their children in the future and want to know where the jobs will come from, to people who feel that globalisation is a runaway train and it's out of control and uncontrollable, we've got to show that we can manage that in the public interest.""

2016-05-23,Staying in EU adds 5m to population - Gove,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36341206,"Staying in the EU could increase the UK's population by up to 5.23m by 2030, Vote Leave has claimed, putting the NHS under ""unsustainable"" pressure.Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the estimates were ""robust"" and voting to leave the EU would strengthen the NHS.He argued the National Living Wage was an extra ""pull factor"" for migrants. Remain campaigners say the 5m figure is ""absurd"" as it is based on five states joining the EU by 2020, which they say ""is not remotely on the cards"".Politics Live: Updates from the EU referendum campaignPrime Minister David Cameron has said it will be ""decades"" before Turkey joins the EU and there is no firm date for the accession of Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia.A document from Vote Leave says the EU's commitment to the free movement of people and the UK's new National Living Wage mean net migration from the EU to the UK will be between 170,000 and 430,000 a year - adding between 2.58m and 5.23m people to the UK population by 2030.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.The group calculates the NHS could have to contend with a new group of patients the size of ""four Birminghams"", and A&E demand could increase by up to 57%. Voting to leave could mean ""millions of pounds saved in ending EU contributions"" could be given to ""strengthen"" the NHS instead, Mr Gove said. ""Boris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear that the NHS will only face additional pressures. ""Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU into UK every year.""But the EU was committed to allowing five new countries to join, he said, whose citizens would ""inevitably"" be attracted to the UK: ""The idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable.""The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Read moreThe Office for National Statistics predicts that net migration to the UK - from countries across the world, not just the EU - will add up to just under three million by 2029.Vote Leave says the ONS has ""consistently underestimated the true level of migration"" in the past and there are ""strong reasons to doubt this forecast"".Mr Gove stood by the Vote Leave figures, describing them as ""robust and methodologically fair"" and denied abandoning the economic argument - which Vote Leave had been focused on at the start of the campaign - to concentrate on immigration. But the Remain campaign said it was ""absurd"" to base figures on five new EU states by 2020 and the UK could veto any new country joining, and apply restrictions on free movement for new EU states.They pointed to comments made by Vote Leave's Boris Johnson to LBC radio in March, when he said Turkey would not join the EU ""in the foreseeable future"" and the idea of 75 million Turks having visa-free travel was ""simply not on the cards"".Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is campaigning the UK to remain in the EU, said: ""I think these figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they're not designed to inform - they're designed to confuse.""And former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said: ""Wrecking the economy by leaving Europe would make our NHS weaker - and patients would pay the price.""These figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU's Single Market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people's wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a £36 billion black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service.""""Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.""Meanwhile European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Le Monde that Britain would have to accept being treated like an outsider if it votes to leave the EU. ""Deserters won't be welcomed with open arms,"" he said.""That is not a threat, but our relations will no longer be as they are today"".But UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker's ""whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels"" adding: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat.""And Vote Leave's Labour chair Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low."""

2016-05-23,Two Britons lose EU vote legal bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36341839,"Two Britons living abroad have lost their Court of Appeal battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.The challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan, 54.Under law, UK citizens who have lived abroad for more than 15 years cannot vote. The pair took the case to the Court of Appeal after losing their application for a judicial review last month. Mr Shindler and Ms MacLennan had argued the in-out vote on EU membership, on 23 June, directly affected them and brought the test case on behalf of others in their situation.In April, they asked High Court judges to declare that section two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established ""the 15-year rule"", unlawfully acted as a penalty for their having exercised their rights to free movement.But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.They then took the case to the Court of Appeal, where a one-day hearing took place earlier this month. Three appeal judges - Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice King - upheld the High Court decision on Friday, declaring the rule did not unlawfully interfere with the right of expats to freedom of movement within the European Union.EU campaign latestEU vote: All you need to knowUK stars back remaining in EUStudents risk missing voteLord Dyson said: ""The claimants say that their exclusion from the franchise is an unjustified restriction on their EU right - EU law right - of free movement and contrary to their constitutional, common law right to vote. ""The appeals against the dismissal of their claims is dismissed. The court holds first that the 2015 Act does not fall within the scope of EU law at all, so that the claim fails at the first hurdle.""He added that ""the common law right to vote does not take precedence over an Act of Parliament"" and refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The expats still have the right to ask Supreme Court judges to consider the case, however. Their lawyers said a hearing had been listed for Tuesday, at which permission to appeal - as well as the substance of the appeal itself - would be considered.Those eligible can register to vote here.The non-Britons who get an EU voteMs McLennan, who is originally from Inverness but has lived in Brussels since 1987, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The refusal to allow me and others in my situation to vote is an infringement of my EU rights.""She added that the result of the vote ""would have a huge impact"" on both her personal and professional life, and that she often returned to the UK to visit her parents and children, and for work. ""I feel very strongly that I ought to have a fundamental democratic right to vote in my country of citizenship,"" said Ms McLennan.Mr Shindler, appointed an MBE for Anglo-Italian relations in 2014, has been told he has ""diminished or diluted"" links to the UK after living abroad for so long. He has lived in Italy for 35 years. The UK passport holder, originally from London, said: ""The fact that we don't live there doesn't alter that fact, we were born British and we will remain that way. ""If we go and live somewhere else, it doesn't make us anything else. They work out here. People don't know who these expats are you know, think they're all on holiday.""He also said the government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed.Law firm Leigh Day, which represents the pair, argued that up to two million British citizens were being unlawfully denied the right to vote on membership of the EU."
2016-05-23,Care 'could suffer' as NHS busts budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36341235,"Patient care could start to suffer after hospitals and other NHS trusts in England overspent by a record £2.45bn last year, experts are warning.The unprecedented deficit for 2015-16 - triple what was recorded the year before - is largely a result of hospitals busting their budgets.They will now need to use extra money they are being given this year to bail themselves out. Hospital chiefs warned that may lead to longer waiting times and poorer care.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"".""We have to rapidly regain control of NHS finances, otherwise we risk lengthening waiting times for patients, limiting their access to wider services and other reductions in the quality of patient care.""The NHS in England is already missing a series of key waiting time targets, including in A&E, cancer care and the ambulance service. There are also a record number of people on waiting lists for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said the mood in the NHS ""could not be bleaker"".""The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky.""There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.""Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS?Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black holeFinancial problems 'endemic in the NHS'Rising demand for NHS services and high spending on agency staff were cited as key factors.However, the deficit was not as large as was predicted earlier in the year as NHS bosses had urged hospitals to rein in spending, particularly on locum staff, on which a cap on how much can be charged has been introduced.The figures have been released by the regulator NHS Improvement and cover ambulance, mental health and community trusts as well as hospitals.Overall 65% of the 240 trusts are in deficit with nearly all hospitals ending the year in the red.When hospital trusts are taken on their own the overspend was £2.6bn on a budget of £56.1bn. Nearly nine in 10 hospitals reported finishing the year in deficit.Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in.But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions.This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts.If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but greater use of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterTaken together all these trusts account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover spending on GPs, training, public health or any unspent money held by local health managers.That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer.Although a hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was ""cooking up accounting alchemy"" by ""turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury"". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of capital spending - for buildings - into day-to-day running costs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading."" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎""We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff,"" he added.The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England.It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. The final accounts have yet to be published."

We need to move on.""Conservative Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he did not think people should be ""swayed by celebrities"".Meanwhile Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has entered the debate, warning that Canada's own trade deal with the EU had taken more than ten years to negotiate and was yet to enter force.""There's nothing easy or automatic about that,"" he said.""Britain is always going to have clout, it's just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU. I believe we're always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn't seem to be a productive path for countries.""The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has defended Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's intervention in the debate last week, when he warned that a vote to leave could cause a recession.Mr Trichet told BBC's This Week's World there was an ""obligation"" for the central bank to ""say candidly what they see"".Those behind the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union said Mr Carney had breached his obligations on impartiality by emphasising only the risks of Brexit. Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC he ""wouldn't expect"" a major financial institution to back the Leave campaign ""because they all wanted to protect the status quo"".And Lord Lamont, a former chancellor, has described ""this daily avalanche of institutional propaganda"" as ""ludicrous and pitiful"".

I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.Updates on this story and more from DerbyshireThe man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them. ""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"". ""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this."" Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".Labour MP Ms Thornberry quit the shadow cabinet in 2014 after a photo she tweeted of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside, during the Rochester by-election, was criticised as ""disrespectful"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""But she accused Leave campaigners of offering ""false promises"" that if the UK left the EU there would be a ""substantial"" change on migration policy."
2016-05-23,Cameron heads off EU trade deal revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36332415,"Downing Street has headed off a revolt over the Queen's Speech by saying it will accept a move to exclude the NHS from a controversial EU-US trade deal. Tory rebels were threatening to join Labour and the SNP to back an amendment ""regretting"" the lack of a bill to protect the NHS from the TTIP deal.But Downing Street has denied them the chance by saying they will back it.One of the MPs tabling the amendment, Labour's Paula Sherriff, described it as a ""humiliating climbdown"" by the PM.""They will now be the first government in history to officially 'regret' their own programme within days of announcing it, just months after doing the same on their Budget,"" she said.Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Steve Baker MP said: ""The government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.""But a spokesman for Number 10 said: ""As we've said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this amendment is selected, we'll accept it.""Also on Thursday, David Cameron told LBC radio  he did not want the EU referendum to become a ""Tory psycho-drama"" involving him and senior ""Leave"" Conservatives Boris Johnson and Michael Gove but claimed former London mayor Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a leaver"". He also described himself as a Eurosceptic but said he believed it was better that the UK remain in the EU.Mr Johnson, in response, said he had been a ""Eurosceptic for decades"" and said: ""I urge my friends in government to recognise that in all logic, and as self-declared Eurosceptics, they should really be campaigning with us on this side of the argument.""The TTIP amendment - signed by 25 Tory MPs - expressed regret that the government has not brought forward a bill to protect the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, currently being negotiated between the EU and the US. Although it would have been a purely symbolic vote, no government has suffered a defeat on a Queen's Speech, which sets out its legislative programme for the year ahead, since 1924.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long opposed TTIP, had said he would back the Conservative rebels.It is understood the SNP and other minority parties were also likely to support the amendment.Sources in the Vote Leave campaign predicted the government had faced defeat unless it backed down.Conservative former minister Peter Lilley, who supported the amendment, said that although he supports free trade, TTIP would introduce ""special courts which are not necessary for free trade, will give American multinationals the right to sue our government (but not vice versa) and could put our NHS at risk"".TTIP is primarily a deal to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade between the US and EU countries, making it potentially easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other's markets.Industries it would affect include pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing and food and drink.The government says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars.In the UK, attention has focused on the potential impact on the NHS, with critics saying TTIP would allow private firms running NHS services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector.What is the future for UK-US trade?Labour MP Frank Field, who backed the amendment, said: ""We can't have kangaroo courts, operating only to America's advantage, deciding how we should trade in respect of the NHS.""SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said: ""The SNP have been at the forefront of the campaign to protect the NHS and other public services from the potential consequences of TTIP, and so we welcome any opportunity to ensure that the Tory government keep the promises they have already made.""But former Labour minister Rachel Reeves, writing on the Labour List website, said: ""Those who want Britain to leave the EU need to stop preying on British peoples' love for the NHS by cynically pretending that TTIP poses a threat. It does not. ""They are demeaning their own campaign by arguing a case they know to be untrue.""But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who like Ms Reeves is backing the Remain campaign, said she would vote for the amendment.She said: ""If we left the EU, then we could be left with the government negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. What then? ""With the Tories still in charge, we could then expect the roll out of multiple TTIPs on steroids as Britain negotiated trade deals with countries across the world."""
2016-05-23,Lib Dem cabinet post welcomed by Farron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36335307,"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has welcomed Kirsty Williams's plan to be education secretary in an otherwise all Labour Welsh Government.  Mr Farron said she would ""retain her independence"" and aim to make education in Wales ""markedly better"" then in the rest of the UK. Ms Williams's appointment is subject to a vote of Welsh Lib Dem members at a special conference on Saturday.She has said she is not taking party support on the matter for granted.The AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, who boosted her majority over the Conservatives at the assembly election to more than 8,000, was named by First Minister Carwyn Jones on Thursday as part of an eight-member cabinet.Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme on Friday, Mr Farron said Ms Williams's cabinet role would be ""great news for education in Wales"". ""Kirsty has that great strength of somebody with great experience of education, the mother of three children who are in Welsh state schools, and somebody who's very committed to making a difference."" Mr Farron said he was ""very impressed"" with the ""hard achievements"" the Liberal Democrats would get out of the agreement with Labour.""But my aim is, and Kirsty's aim will be, that education in Wales will be markedly better than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of Kirsty and the Liberal Democrats' involvement in this administration."" Asked if she was confident of getting her party's support, the former Welsh Lib Dem leader said: ""I never take anything for granted in politics.""The great thing about being a member of the Welsh Liberal Democrats [is that] it's not up to individuals to make these choices. ""Every single member of our party will have an opportunity to have their say and have a vote on this decision.""Ms Williams denied her appointment would effectively mean her party ceased to exist in the assembly.""It exists with a cabinet minister, hopefully subject to the party agreement, being able to implement Welsh Liberal Democrat policies and influencing the agenda,"" she said.""That's a lot stronger than being a single assembly member on a backbench.""Ms Williams said she would never leave her party, and did not think Labour, Plaid and the Welsh Liberal Democrats should merge or have a formal relationship.""There are different traditions and political strands that are represented by each of the parties.""What is important is that we look to work where we can together and recognise that the way in which politics happens in Wales is changing.""It isn't about one single party driving home their manifesto without due reference to other voices.""The deal between Ms Williams and Labour agrees a list of nine common priorities which include pledges from the Welsh Lib Dem election manifesto, such as:It also calls for the upcoming recommendations of the Diamond Review into student finance to be considered ""with a view to early implementation where appropriate"" but with no ""negative effect"" on the higher education budget.The Lib Dem tuition fee policy at the election was to end tuition fee support grants that students currently get. The party proposed to replace it with a student living support grant funded by the other grant's withdrawal - but this is not written into the agreement.Ms Williams was the only opposition AM to back Mr Jones in the first deadlocked vote for first minister - despite Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP supporting Plaid leader Leanne Wood.Mr Jones was later reinstated after he came to an agreement with Plaid Cymru - although no members of that party were appointed to his cabinet.Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said it is unlikely all the policies in the agreement between Ms Williams and Welsh Labour will get support of parties outside the government.He said on Twitter: ""Important to note these policies will need opposition support to be implemented. Unlikely that all will succeed.""The senior Plaid figure also questioned the Lib Dems' pledge in the agreement to reduce infant class sizes to 25.He said that ""most evidence suggests you need to reduce to 15 to have any real effect. Reducing to 25 is costly but ineffective"".Meanwhile UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said Ms Williams should resign her seat and seek a fresh mandate in a by-election.He said: ""When UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless left their old parties, they did the honourable thing and went back to their electors at a by-election to seek a new mandate to represent them.""Kirsty is now duty bound to support Labour 100% over this five-year assembly term. ""I call on her to take the same honourable course and seek a fresh mandate from her constituents because, in all but name, she has now become a Labour AM."" "
2016-05-23,Students risk missing referendum vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-36303347,"UK university students believe the EU referendum is key to their future, but almost two-thirds do not know when it is, suggests research. And a third of more than 2,000 students questioned feared being unable to get to their polling station on the day. The referendum, on 23 June, is outside term time, so many students will need to re-register at their home address, says the National Union of Students. NUS vice-president Richard Brooks urged students ""to think ahead"". ""The EU referendum is a once-in-a-generation vote,"" said Mr Brooks. ""The decision made on the 23 June will impact young people and students the most, as they are the ones that will live with the consequences for the longest.""If students don't want their future decided for them, it is essential that as many as possible get out and vote.""Mr Brooks urged students to think about where they would be on referendum day and to make sure they register or re-register at the right address. ""If they are unsure about where they will be, students can register at both their term-time and home address, providing they only vote once,"" he said.""If they are going to be on holiday or are heading to Glastonbury, they should apply for a postal vote.""People had until 17:00 on 7 June to register if they wanted to vote in the referendum, he added. It is also possible to apply for a postal or proxy vote by 17:00 on 8 June. The interviews, carried out this month on a representative sample of students from across the UK by YouthSight for Universities UK, found: Universities UK and the Association of Colleges are holding voter registration drives at institutions across the UK. Students will be advised to register, re-register or apply for proxy or postal votes, according to their circumstances. UUK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said it was of ""real concern"" that so many students were unaware of the referendum date and that they might have to re-register to vote at another address. ""From this week, universities will be scaling up their efforts to encourage students to register to vote, and to make sure they do so in the right location,"" she said.""With nearly two million UK students eligible to vote in the referendum, it is vital that they have all the necessary information to make sure they can take part in this hugely important decision."""

A Downing Street spokesman said ""we don't accept"" Mr Baker's claims. In other EU referendum campaign developments:The government is campaigning for a vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum and Prime Minister David Cameron, whose party is divided on the issue, has previously called for a ""respectful"" debate. But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate ""breathtakingly disheartening"".Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in ""Downing Street hostage videos"".Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended ""into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people"".He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as ""economically illiterate"" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his ""preposterous, obscene"" remarks.""I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,"" said Mr Baker.Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as ""from the past"" following his intervention.Mr Baker claimed there had been ""intolerable media smears"" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: ""It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.""He added: ""If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign ""can't make an honest and positive case"" because they ""know it's a losing argument"".""So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,"" he said. He added: ""What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't accept Steve Baker's article.""All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.""The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: ""Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.""In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based ""employees worse off"".Writing in The Times, he warned financial jobs could leave London for Paris or Frankfurt and said ""a vote to leave is a risk""."

2016-05-23,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"The referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union, or remain a member, is on 23 June. So far, opinion polls suggest the campaign has had little impact on voters. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes assesses what the polls may be telling us.Read the full methodologyThere's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months. The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters. That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention. Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote. ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-23,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-23,Resident rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36316467,"It might seem peculiar that a young Australian here in Britain on a two-year working holiday is allowed to have a say on whether the UK should leave the European Union. But Michael Ingle, a 27-year-old physiotherapist living in Surrey, defends his right to participate in the 23 June referendum.He says that as a taxpayer, and a citizen of the Commonwealth, what happens to Britain is important to him and will have ramifications for the wider world well beyond the cliffs of Dover.""It's not just about Britain for me, which is why I've taken an interest in it,"" Mr Ingle, from Sydney, says.""It's about the West and the stability of this continent.""As a hangover from the days of empire, when so-called ""British subjects"" were included in the parliamentary franchise, Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK without British nationality retain the right to vote in elections.Estimates based on the 2011 census put the number of Commonwealth citizens eligible to vote in the forthcoming referendum at between 894,000 and more than 960,000.They join Irish citizens as the only non-Brits allowed to vote in what David Cameron has called a ""once in a generation"" decision. This has drawn the ire of groups including Migration Watch UK.Its chair, Lord Green of Deddington, says that ""important decisions about Britain should be taken by those who are British citizens and only by them"".A petition to parliament signed by more than 40,000 people, meanwhile, has claimed that allowing non-Brits to vote would bias the result towards the Remain side, especially given that the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta are also in the EU.But regardless of whether one agrees with the voting rules, such claims treat Commonwealth voters as a homogenous bloc of sorts, destined to vote in the same way.This obscures the fact that Commonwealth citizens living in Britain come from a diverse range of 53 countries in all the world's time zones.Voters of even the same age and nationality can have vastly different views on the subject at hand.Take Farhan Samsudin and Zila Fawzi, two young Malaysian women living in London.Farhan, who works in banking, says she will vote Remain on 23 June, despite what she says is the failure of either campaign to provide information on how the ""Commonwealth constituency"" might be affected by the result.She thinks the UK should strengthen its economic ties with Asian economies like Malaysia and sees membership of the EU as an obstacle in trade negotiations.Yet, with no clear plans presented to her on how a post-EU Britain would approach the world, she says she'll vote to stay.Zila, on the other hand, who is on a British government-funded scholarship, supports an EU exit.Her vote will be pinned on hopes that immigration policy will change in a way that benefits Commonwealth citizens if the UK no longer has to abide by free movement within the EU.""Once they are out of the EU it would be easier, especially for us Malaysians, to come and work here,"" she says.A postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, Zila is frustrated by the fact that any EU citizen is allowed to work in the UK, while highly educated Commonwealth citizens like her are turned away.On this point, Farhan chimes in.""The British government sponsors brilliant minds like her but they don't give any leeway for her to work here,"" she says, shaking her head. ""It's a real waste.""Avenues for Commonwealth citizens to migrate to the UK have become increasingly slim since the abolishment of working holiday visas (now limited to just a handful of countries under the Youth Mobility Scheme) and the post-study work visa, which allowed students to stay on for two years after the end of their course.Foreign students from outside the EU, many of whom are from the Commonwealth, now have just four months to find a job if they want to stay.The recent introduction of a £35,000 income threshold for non-EU skilled workers to settle in the UK in a bid to reduce net migration has led to further frustration and the spectre of mass deportations.Yet, while it would seem as though pro-Brexit campaigners could capitalise on the prickly issue of immigration in order to draw Commonwealth voters to their side, the issue is not so clear-cut.Given that some of the constituencies that the Leave campaign are courting harbour anti-immigrant sentiment, making a pitch to Commonwealth voters to back an EU exit based on immigration potential could see it take a hit elsewhere, says Ralph Buckle, director of the Commonwealth Exchange think tank.""Everyone has this number of what they think the right level of immigration is. It depends whether that number is high enough to include an increase [from] the Commonwealth.""The government's target of getting net migration under 100,000 annually also hovers ominously over any suggestion that more places could go to Commonwealth citizens if Brexit eventuated.The official Vote Leave campaign has said Britain could have a ""fairer"" migration policy that would ""make it easier for some to come, such as scientists and job-creators"" if the UK left the EU.In February Vote Leave published a letter to David Cameron from community and business leaders with Commonwealth links criticising immigration policy.""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom,"" they said.But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, speaking for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said that leaving the EU in order to end free movement would hurt everyone in Britain economically, including Commonwealth citizens.""Commonwealth citizens living in the UK benefit from jobs, lower prices and financial security we get from being part of the world's largest single market.""Commonwealth countries around the world, from Australia to Jamaica, are urging us to stay in the EU,"" he said.In a newspaper article last August, Lord Howell, chairman of Commonwealth Exchange and a former Conservative minister, said the polarity of the EU question was ""maddeningly oversimplified"" for internationally-minded Commonwealth citizens.He said the Leave campaign could not fall back on a ""little England mantra"", while the Remain camp would have to move away from ""seeing the continent as the UK's only future"".Mark Sultana, a 48-year-old long-time UK resident who organises events for fellow Canadians living in London, sees both sides of the picture.While he bemoans ""all the wastage and all the subsidies"" of the EU, he fears financial instability and losing the right to retire on the continent.""The whole thing is so complicated,"" he says.""I think ultimately even though I'm so anti all these things, so many things that the EU stands for… from the point of view of economic stability, the fact you're in it and that the world should be [becoming] a smaller place not a bigger place… [I would vote with] a grudging and qualified yes.""Mark also points out that the immigration argument means different things for different Commonwealth citizens.Canadians who live in the UK by virtue of European ancestry like himself, for example, might be fearful of losing that right in the case of a Brexit.""For that generation of that ilk, who came here, the European Union is very important. If you have Brexit there's a whole lot of people who would have trouble coming here.""For Brad Argent, meanwhile, having to deal with UK visa hassles despite being married to an English woman makes him feel like ""a second-class citizen"".The 50-year-old Australian, who works for an internet business, needs to wait for five years to get residency.""Whereas if I'm from Europe I can just come over on the train and set up house,"" he says outside Australia's High Commission on the Strand in London, where he has come to renew his passport.But Brad won't carry his these grievances to the ballot box, least of all because he does not want his British children to lose the right to work in the continent.""I think a vote to leave just out of spite because I'm a member of the Commonwealth, whilst that might feel good for about five minutes, I think the longer term implications I would start to regret,"" he says.With Commonwealth migrants unlikely to vote as a uniform bloc due to their divergent interests and circumstances, it appears either camp could still make a pitch to this 'constituency', which has largely been ignored in the debate thus far.After all, a million votes are at stake."
2016-05-23,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36345081,"The claim: Migration from the European Union will increase the UK's population by between 2.58 million and 5.23 million by 2030. This would create a 28% to 57% increase in demand for A&E services.Reality Check verdict: Some migration from the EU is expected but the assumptions behind these population forecasts are very unlikely to be realised. An increasing population would put additional demand on A&E but the extent of that increase has not been demonstrated.Justice Secretary Michael Gove has unveiled Vote Leave's research on the effect free movement will have on the National Health Service.The document makes broad predictions, but even so, some of the assumptions it makes are questionable.The lower end of the forecast, that EU migration will rise by 2.58 million by 2030, is based on taking the most recent ONS net migration figure and multiplying it by 15.But the ONS actually produces a forecast for total net migration by 2029 (so not just from the EU), which it expects to have added 3 million to the population by then.Now there are uncertainties surrounding all forecasts, but it makes the bottom end of Vote Leave's forecast look somewhat high by comparison.To get to the higher ends of the forecast, the research assumes that all five current candidate countries wanting to join the EU (Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and FYR Macedonia) do so in 2020. This is very unlikely to happen. You can read more about why Turkey in particular is not going to join the EU by 2020 here. They also assume no transitional controls to limit migration from the new members. Existing states are allowed to impose seven years of restrictions to freedom of movement from new members, as the UK did with Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.Add to that the impact of the new National Living Wage and you get to Vote Leave's ""high"" forecast of 5.23 million. The quote from Michael Gove above is supposed to illustrate the ""medium"" forecast, which excludes the effect of the National Living Wage to get to a figure of 4.25 million. The population of Birmingham is about 1.1 million.It is hard to completely discount any forecast. Even so, the line about four Birminghams is hard to justify based on these such assumptions.From the figures on the growing population, the research gets to a figure on the extra demand from A&E departments, concluding that it would lead to an increase in demand of between 28% and 57%.It has reached these figures by looking at increases in A&E attendance since 2002 and noting a strong correlation with cumulative net migration over that time. In other words, attendances to A&E went up quickly at a time when there was continuous net migration to the UK.This relationship is then used to predict how future migration would affect demand for A&E.The problem is that while demand for A&E has gone up at the same time as there has been migration, the research has not demonstrated that one has caused the other.While it is clearly true that higher numbers of migrants would mean more A&E visits, it could be that A&E attendances have gone up for other reasons as well, so the relationship is not reliable.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-23,House of Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36330992,"It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that ""my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons"", she was signalling a retreat. Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers. A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits. Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention -  an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation. Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions. Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.Government to review Lords powers after tax credits defeatLimiting Lords powers 'calls its future into question'It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords. ""We're defeating the government more often than is good for us,"" a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?807Peers247 Conservative 211 Labour 175 Crossbench 109 Liberal Democrat Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation. My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight. 650Members of Parliament330 Conservative 229 Labour 54 SNP 8 Liberal Democrat ""There's no point in us existing,"" he told me, ""if we don't vote for the things we believe in.""That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened. In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems;  in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247. Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election. ""The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords,"" he says.Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place. ""It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is,"" says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a ""spurious"" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time. He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake. The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.""We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event,"" he said.David Cameron's real problem isn't peers, Lib Dem or otherwise. It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled. Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government. It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem. "

You could also look at the number of non-UK nationals (rather than everyone born abroad, which includes British citizens). They account for 56% of the rise.Responding to the latest unemployment figures, Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: ""Our labour market is thriving, but it's notable that more than three quarters of the rise in employment over the last year has come from people born abroad.""The figures suggest that people born abroad account for 80% of the rise in employment - as Mr Duncan Smith says, more than three quarters. But the figure for the number of people born abroad includes UK nationals who were born in other countries.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces figures for non-UK nationals working in the UK, which suggests 56% of the increase in employment may be attributed to non-UK nationals.In the context of the referendum the broader point the Leave Campaign has been making is that there's been a big increase in the proportion of people working in the UK who are EU nationals.The proportion of UK workers who are non-UK EU nationals has indeed increased considerably. In the first three months of this year, about 6.8% of UK workers were non-UK EU nationals. Five years ago that figure was 4.5% and 10 years ago it was 2.6%. If you look at the numbers behind that, at the moment there are 2.15 million EU nationals working in the UK. Five years ago it was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-23,War of words,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36304729,"The EU referendum debate is rapidly turning into a festival of name-calling and insults. How did we get here?It all started out so well. David Cameron decided to allow members of his cabinet to campaign for either side in the EU referendum. Some argue he had no choice, given the likelihood of resignations. Others wondered how it would work, with big personalities like Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith having public disagreements with Mr Cameron and George Osborne one minute and then calmly putting aside their differences the next to get on with running the country. But both sides insisted they could be grown up about it.  ""We should all be big enough to have an honest and open, but polite disagreement, and then come back together again afterwards,"" said Mr Cameron.Announcing his decision to join the Leave campaign in February, Boris Johnson praised the PM's renegotiation attempts, and urged his divided Conservative colleagues to ""play the ball and not the man"". There was plenty of ill-feeling flying around before the debate proper got under way, with a bitter and personal row between the two rival Leave campaigns and mutterings from Eurosceptic backbenchers about how little they thought Mr Cameron had achieved in his renegotiations.But the big beasts managed to keep it relatively civil, with personal attacks couched in the coded language of Westminster. David Cameron's comments in the Commons, shortly after Boris Johnson joined the Leave camp, about having ""no other agenda than what is best for our country"" was interpreted as a jibe at the former London mayor's leadership ambitions. It was written up in the press as a ""war"" between the two men. Iain Duncan Smith may have resigned from the Cabinet over cuts to disability benefits in March's Budget - but it gave him freedom to say what he really thinks about David Cameron and George Osborne and their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. And he has not held back. He has been scathing about Mr Cameron's renegotiations, claiming he achieved ""nothing"", and has accused the Remain campaign of ""spin, smears and threats"" to try to ""bully"" Britons into voting to stay. He has also appealed for calm, warning that all the rows risk long-term damage to the Conservative Party.What has enraged the Leave camp, possibly more than anything else, is the way in which they think the prime minister has used the might of the government machine to rig the referendum debate in his favour. The government's decision, in April, to spend £9m on sending a glossy brochure to every household in the country led to loud cries of foul play. David Cameron said the government was entitled to state its case. But Boris Johnson claimed the PM had reneged on his promise to ""fight fair"" during the referendum because he was ""losing the argument"". The Treasury's analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit provoked an even more furious reaction from the Leavers, particularly when George Osborne accused them of being ""economically illiterate"". The former Mayor of London has been on vintage form during this campaign, dreaming up ever more inventive ways of trashing the Remain campaign, headed by his old friend and rival David Cameron.He has compared them to jeweller Gerald Ratner, who famously called his own products ""crap"". He has described the global leaders backing the Remain campaign as appearing in Downing Street ""hostage videos"".A visit to an underwear factory in Derbyshire proved to be a target rich environment for the ex-Mayor.He compared the EU to a ""badly designed undergarment"", shouted ""pants on fire"" at the Remain campaign, before unleashing the inevitable battle cry:  ""Knickers to all those who talk Britain down.""David Cameron has largely avoided slinging mud back at Boris, but another Old Etonian Conservative MP has stepped manfully into the breach. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill and ardent supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, is not a fan of the former London mayor, it seems.When Mr Johnson penned an article referencing Barack Obama's ""part Kenyan"" ancestry, Sir Nicholas had this to say on LBC radio:  ""I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive.""Sir Nicholas has kept up the Boris-baiting on his Twitter account, calling him the ""unchallenged master of the self inflicted wound"" and branding his comments about Hitler and the EU ""absurd, desperate and outright offensive"".With Labour MPs and members overwhelmingly supportive of the Remain campaign, ""red on red"" attacks have been less frequent than the ""blue on blue"" variety.  But Jeremy Corbyn's previous Eurosceptic sentiments have not gone unnoticed by the Labour Leave campaign. Labour MP Kate Hoey suggested the Labour leader (motto ""straight talking, honest politics"") was being less than straight with his decision to embrace the Remain cause.She said Labour voters would ""see through"" him. ""We know first of all, that he doesn't really mean it, no matter how much he tries to pretend he does, and secondly, that it is not in the interest of the Labour movement,"" she told the BBC News channel.Mr Corbyn says he wants to stay in the EU to fight for social reforms and workers' rights.The prime minister's warning that peace could be at risk from an EU exit did not go down well with the Leave side. It was mocked by Boris Johnson, who said it was ""very curious"" that the prime minister had called a referendum on leaving the EU, only to warn us ""that World War III is about to break out unless we vote to remain"".The Leave campaign's constant refrain is that Remain are trying to scare voters into backing their side. They call it Project Fear.The Remain campaign, for its part, have tried to suggest the Leavers are a bunch of swivel-eyed conspiracy theorists.""The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster,"" said George Osborne last week, on a visit to Stansted airport with Ed Balls and Sir Vince Cable.There is an old internet maxim, known as Godwin's Law, that states the longer a debate goes on the more likely it is that someone will bring up Hitler or the Nazis.It was Boris Johnson who proved it correct last week, when he compared the EU's efforts to unify Europe to Hitler's. This was the moment that turned simmering tensions into (apologies for mixing the metaphors) a full-blown firestorm.Lord Heseltine - a longstanding supporter of the EU - suggested that the strain of the campaign must be getting to Boris Johnson, causing him to lose his judgement, blasting Mr Johnson's Hitler article as ""preposterous"" and ""obscene"" and suggesting he is not fit be Tory leader.Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Lord Heseltine as a ""voice from the past"" and fellow Leave campaigner Steve Baker accused Downing Street of being behind ""vicious briefings"" against his side, as he called for an end to ""personal nastiness"".And that is where we are today, with Conservative MPs on all sides appealing for an end to ""blue-on-blue"" conflict as the civil war in their party appears to rage out of control.But at least one Tory Leave campaigner is taking the longer view. Jacob-Rees Mogg,  writing in the Financial Times has drawn parallels with Conservative splits over the Corn Laws in the 19th century.""The Tory party survived great splits when its discipline and structures were much less well founded than they are now. The EU referendum will decide the matter of Europe for a generation - and the party is united in all other important policy areas."""

2016-05-23,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160522033219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-24,Scots vote 'within two years of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36393483,"Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has said he would expect another referendum on Scottish independence within two years of a Brexit vote, in a BBC EU debate.He said if Scotland is ""dragged out"" of the EU ""against our will"" on 23 June, he believed there would be another vote - and it would back independence. But Conservative Liam Fox said the EU vote should not be ""stoked by fear"" of a second Scottish referendum.Voters aged 18-to-29 took part in the BBC debate in Glasgow.Ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, the at-times feisty debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - also included Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU, and UKIP's Diane James, who is campaigning for a Leave vote.Former First Minister Mr Salmond, who backs remaining in the EU, told the audience a second Scottish independence referendum ""would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw"" from the EU, should it vote to leave.He said: ""If you had the situation where Scotland, in four weeks' time, votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.""""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""But Leave supporter Mr Fox accused Mr Salmond of ""yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum"".Mr Fox said: ""I have never been very sure what the SNP didn't understand about the result - the Scottish people voted to stay in the UK.""He said the EU referendum was ""a decision that we take as the UK... every vote counts.""It's a decision for all the people in the UK and we should take it on the merits of the European Union debate and not be sidetracked into yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum.""BBC political correspondent Iain WatsonIt was lively. It was feisty. And that was just the audience.The BBC referendum debate gathered together 18 to 29-year-olds from all over the UK to hear four panellists, the youngest of whom - 54-year-old Liam Fox - was a quarter of a century older than the oldest member of the audience.But the most striking contribution came from 60-something Alex Salmond. The former first minister of Scotland didn't just want to talk about this referendum, but the next one.Read more from Iain.During a wide-ranging discussion, the audience criticised both campaigns for using the economy and immigration to ""get the emotions ramped up"". Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the ""scaremongering"" material put out by the Treasury on the Remain side, adding: ""It wouldn't be economic apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more chances if we stay in.""He said: ""That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose.""To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case.""Some of the young voters taking part criticised ""tit-for-tat"" attacks during the campaign, describing it as ""petty name-calling"" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been ""appalling"".She said there had been a focus on migration ""on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government.. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy"". Other issues raised during the debate included travel, the NHS, house prices and jobs. Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, Mr Fox said: ""Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after.""Why do we have these arrangements? Because it is genuinely in the interests of both parties to do so.""But Labour's Mr Johnson said: ""At the moment, we have a very beneficial system we can go anywhere within the EU, it's a two-way process...""There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are you going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas.""He added: ""Unless you put a border and watchtowers across the borders between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, you're going to have people coming across there because you're going to have an EU country and a non-EU country."" Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, UKIP's Ms James said: ""We just don't know"".She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a ""Plan B""."

2016-05-24,G7 leaders warn of Brexit risk to growth,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394905,"A declaration at the G7 meeting in Japan says a vote by the UK to leave the European Union would pose a ""serious threat to global growth"".In its final statement, the group warned that a UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend of increased global trade, investment and jobs. The meeting brings together the world's leading seven industrialised nations. The final communiqué set global growth as a priority for dealing with threats to the world's economy and security.But the warning about the economic consequences of the UK leaving the European Union comes as Britain prepares for a referendum on 23 June. Prime Minister David Cameron has been campaigning for Britain to stay within the 28-country bloc with recent polls suggesting a lead for those who support remaining within the EU. The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideAnalysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondentThat Brexit has been seen as a serious risk to the world economy at the G7 shouldn't surprise anyone. The G7 finance ministers meeting over the weekend in Sendai came to the same conclusion - and it was what the Japanese Central Bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told me in an interview earlier this week. What is surprising is how much of an impact this communique says a yes vote will have on global growth - jobs, investment and trade will be affected. But it's also sentiment - investors are nervous about what Brexit will mean for confidence in Europe and how it will change the landscape of the world economy. No one likes uncertainty, and with 26 days left before the referendum, expect a lot more of these sorts of global statements.After two days of talks, the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan set global growth as an ""urgent priority.""The group pledged to ""collectively tackle"" major risks to global growth, including threats to the international order from terrorist attacks and violent extremism.The statement promised to commit ""to strengthening... policy responses in a cooperative manner and to employing a more forceful and balanced policy mix, in order to swiftly achieve a strong, sustainable and balanced growth pattern"".""We remain committed to ensuring that growth is inclusive and job-rich, benefiting all segments of our societies,"" the document added. They also called for international markets to be kept open to fight all forms of protectionism and for countries to avoid competitive devaluations of their currencies.The G7 has also released an action plan to counter terrorism which they hope will close ""critical gaps"" in capacity and international cooperation. Aside from stepping up information sharing between countries and Interpol, they also said they would improve border control and aviation security. The communiqué described the migrant crisis in Europe ""as a global challenge which requires a global response"" of increased aid from international financial institutions and donor countries.The statement went on to express ""concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas"" where maritime disputes have lead to increasing regional tensions over the past years.  While there is no mention of China and its expansion into territorially disputed waters specifically, the document calls for respecting freedom of navigation and for resolving conflicts peacefully through law."
2016-05-24,UK set to send second warship to Libya,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394597,"The UK is set to send another warship to the Mediterranean to help tackle people-smuggling and movements of arms in and out of Libya, officials say.David Cameron told the G7 summit in Japan that the UK was ready to take an ""active leadership role"" in helping Libya deal with trafficking. The UK currently has one survey vessel, HMS Enterprise, operating in the area.For the UK to send another warship, the EU will need to extend the mandate of its current naval operation.UK officials at this week's meeting of G7 industrialised nations said they would seek UN approval so that the new warship could also seize boats suspected of smuggling arms to fighters of so-called Islamic State in Libya. Last Sunday the new Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli asked the European Union for more help in training its navy and coastguard to stop the trafficking of migrants across the Mediterranean.It is thought this may soon be followed by a request for international ships to operate in Libyan waters.If this request is received, the UK will seek the extension of the EU's Operation Sophia mission to tackle people-trafficking in the central Mediterranean, as well as a Security Council resolution at the UN enabling its forces to assist in the interception of arms shipments.This week the UK sent four military planners to the Rome headquarters of Operation Sophia, with the goal of preparing a plan to improve the effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard.Downing Street did not say what type of Royal Navy ship would be sent and declined to discuss what evidence it had for illicit arms movements from the Libyan coast.Mr Cameron first put forward the idea of extending Operation Sophia into Libyan territorial waters at a Brussels summit of the EU in March.He warned that the number of migrants attempting to cross via the central Mediterranean could be expected to swell once the alternative route through Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans had been closed."
2016-05-24,Hundreds more terror records deleted,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394494,"Errors that led to fingerprint and DNA records of hundreds of terror suspects being deleted were more widespread than thought, it has emerged. The Biometrics Commissioner said two months ago that 450 profiles had been wrongly deleted from a police database in England and Wales. But in an updated report, Alastair MacGregor revealed the figure was 810. The Home Office, which released the report, said steps were being taken to fix the issue. Under a new system introduced in 2013, DNA and fingerprint profiles of people who are not convicted of a crime have to be removed from a counter-terrorism database. However, the records can be kept in the interests of national security - such as in cases where someone has been suspected of having links to terrorism - when a senior officer makes a national security determination (NSD).But Mr MacGregor said the 810 profiles had been deleted because police officers had failed to make NSD applications in time.He found that in at least 108 cases there would have been national security grounds to store the data and the records ""could and should have been retained"".He added: ""It is obviously very important that steps quickly be taken to establish whether - and, if so, how - replacement material should be obtained from those individuals and/or other action should be taken to minimise any risk which they pose to national security.""Mr MacGregor also revised upwards the number of people on British counter-terrorism databases who have not been convicted of a ""recordable"" offence, from 3,800 to 4,500.However, he said he was ""broadly satisfied"" that the issues he raised were being addressed.A Home Office spokesman said: ""The commissioner has concluded that steps are being taken to address these issues, and the police have provided further assurances that they will be kept under close review.""The government's full response to the commissioner's annual report will be published in due course.""Source: Biometrics Commissioner's annual report, 2015, and Home Office and National DNA database annual report"
2016-05-24,Treasury warns of 'Brexit pension hit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36393513,"The Treasury has warned that millions of current and future pensioners will be worse off if the UK leaves the European Union.Its analysis suggests Brexit would cause inflation to rise, eroding the value of state pension increases, costing recipients £137 a year.Those with an additional pension pot worth £60,000 would see its value drop by £1,900, the Treasury said.However, Vote Leave said the analysis was ""utterly outrageous"".Former Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for Vote Leave, said: ""This is an utterly outrageous attempt by the government to do down people's pensions and is little more than a cynical attempt to distract from the government's broken promises on immigration.""""The biggest threat to British pensions is the European Commission's proposals to undermine occupational pensions, which the government themselves have described as 'damaging and reckless'.""Meanwhile, tax proposals from Eurozone countries will wipe billions off British assets hitting pension funds hardest,"" he said.The Treasury analysis also looked at the impact Brexit would have on someone aged 50.Its analysis found that an individual with pension savings of £20,000, who is contributing 8% of their earnings into a pension fund between now and 2030, would be between £223 and £335 a year worse off in retirement.Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Much of the [Brexit] debate so far has focused on the potential economic fallout of a vote for Leave for those now in work, in terms of the impact on their jobs. ""But it's important that pensioners understand what's at stake for them too on 23 June.""Pensioners who have worked hard all their lives deserve dignity, security and certainty in retirement. That's what we all hope for and what any responsible government should seek to provide,"" the Chancellor said.Pensions minister Baroness Altmann, told the BBC's Today programme, that there was a ""consensus"" among major economic bodies such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the OECD, the head of the IMF and the Bank of England  that the British economy would be weaker if there was a vote to leave the EU.""I have looked at pensions for years. If there is uncertainty, markets do not do well. If there is economic weakness companies cannot do well and that means your investments in pensions and the amount of money put in pensions will fall,"" she added.Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy, Hargreaves Lansdown said such forecasting was ""ambitious"".""The Treasury paints a fairly apocalyptic picture of widespread reductions in retirement incomes. ""The key assumptions they make are of higher inflation and lower economic growth; both of these assumptions may be open to challenge by the Leave campaign. ""Change the underlying assumptions and you change the outcomes."" The state pension has been subjected to a triple lock since 2010, ensuring it rises each year by whichever is higher - inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.He said at the moment state pensioners were receiving annual increases above the rate of inflation.Higher prices would erode this benefit, but because state pension increases are pegged to inflation their standard of living would be maintained.Mr McPhail said higher prices are likely to be more of a problem for some final salary pensions and many individual annuities that are not fully inflation-proofed.""Higher inflation could therefore undermine the real value of these incomes.""However we also note that a rise in bond yields following a Leave vote could equally have a significant beneficial impact on final salary scheme deficits.""He said a recent survey by fund managers conducted by Hargreaves Lansdown on the impact of Brexit, found the majority agreed it would mean lower GDP over 1 to 2 years, but more than a fifth suggested it could be higher in 5-10 years. In the longer term they forecast Brexit would have no impact on the economy."
2016-05-24,"Net migration to UK rises to 333,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382199,"Net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates - the second highest figure on record.Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high.Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been ""cynical"" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK was part of the EU.Speaking to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Conservative MP and former London Mayor said it was ""cynical and unacceptable to say you can fulfil that pledge"".""I think that they (the figures) show the scandal of the promise made by politicians repeatedly that they could cut immigration to the tens of thousands and then to throw their hands up in the air and say there's nothing we can do because Brussels has taken away our control of immigration,"" he said.Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU in June's referendum, said he was pro-immigration but there was ""no public consent for the scale of immigration we are seeing"" and the situation was ""completely out of control"".He said that the only solution was to leave the EU, saying that a vote to stay in the union would mean people ""kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration"".Laura Kuenssberg said the immigration figures ""could hardly have come at a more sensitive time, just when the referendum campaign is moving into a more brutal and frantic phase"".Home Office minister James Brokenshire said David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU, which will see restrictions placed on the benefits new arrivals can claim and a crackdown on ""sham marriages"", would ""close back-door routes"" into the country. ""Leaving the EU is absolutely no panacea or silver bullet,"" he added, telling BBC News that net migration from outside the EU was higher than from within it and leaving would ""wreck the economy and harm jobs"". In other developments, with four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June on whether to stay in or leave the EU:According to the Office for National Statistics, there was a 20,000 rise in net migration to the UK from the 313,000 for the year to December 2014.The figure is well above the government's aim of getting it to the ""tens of thousands"" and is the highest recorded for a calendar year.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.A Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether Mr Cameron remained committed to that target but said the government would ""continue to look at what more might be done"".The spokesman added: ""Of course people rightly have concerns on immigration but the PM's view is very clearly that wrecking the economy and destroying jobs by getting rid of our privileged access to the world's biggest market is not the answer.""He said the Leave campaign failed to spell out what would happen to migration if the UK left the EU, with some saying ""they will cut migration while telling other groups that they will keep freedom of movement or increase visas"".Thursday's figures show estimated levels of long-term migration into the UK from within the EU and outside in the year to December 2015.They show that 270,000 EU citizens moved to the UK for at least a year in 2015, up from 264,000 in 2014. The number of non-EU citizens moving to the UK was 277,000, down from 287,000 in 2014.The rise in the net figure was the result of a fall in the numbers of people emigrating.Analysis By Home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe net migration figure is just short of the record but that statistic alone doesn't do justice to the global picture and the UK's place in it. Everywhere you look, people are on the move - coming and going depending on economic and political circumstances. EU immigration is relatively stable - although there are more southern Europeans than before thanks to the Eurozone's economic doldrums. One really interesting figure, that doesn't affect the population headcount - officially at least - is the 110,000 rise in short-term immigration to about 1.2m. More people are coming for less than a year - such as short contract workers selected by employers who are looking internationally for the best people at the most competitive price. But it will also include some Brits who spend part of the year here - and the rest living in the sun. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the numbers show ""mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU, going on with disastrous open borders"".But former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett warned that an agreement with France to allow British border controls at Calais and the Eurostar terminals in Paris and Brussels would be at risk if Britain left the EU. He criticised Leave campaigners for wanting to create a ""fortress Britain"" - and defended the last Labour government's record immigration, saying ""We didn't just simply say to Poles coming in back in 2004, just come here, we said we'd rather you come here and work than be in the sub-economy."" He added: ""40% of those who registered to work back in 2004 were already in the country and the reason I make that point is because a lot of people would come in illegally if we didn't have the border controls on French soil.""  The Institute of Directors said the public was ""being very poorly served by the current level of the debate on immigration"" and people came to work in the UK because it is one of ""best performing economies in Europe"".""Employment is at a record high, and there are big skills gaps that employers cannot fill domestically. Despite the overblown rhetoric that today's figures have sparked, the actual numbers have not changed much in the last year,"" said IoD employment spokesman Seamus Nevin.Other ONS figures on employment show:How to follow the BBC One EU referendum debate"
2016-05-24,French unions oppose Hinkley Point,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394601,"The future of the planned new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point remains in doubt as key French unions still oppose the project, BBC Newsnight has learned. EDF, which would build the plant, had delayed a decision on the project in Somerset until the summer while it consulted French union representatives.The company, which is 85% French state-owned, had hoped to win support from a committee of workplace representatives. But the committee said staff had not been reassured about the plant's costs.Trade union representatives hold six of the 18 seats on EDF's board.Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of the Central Works Committee that EDF consulted with, told Newsnight that staff feared the cost of the project would cripple EDF.He said: ""We have reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation, and procurement.""The trade unions are unlikely to give their blessing to the project in its current state. All you need to know about Hinkley Point""We are not reassured by the documents we have received. We have been given a marketing folder, not the full information we require.""We got the documents on 9 May - we are sending EDF a request for more explanations.""On Monday French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron wrote to MPs on Westminster's energy select committee to reassure them the French government remained committed to the project.But Mr Macron added: ""It is also necessary, in the interests of all, that EDF follows due process before committing itself to an investment of this magnitude. ""The consultation of the Central Works Committee brings legal robustness on the decision.""EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz also told MPs on the committee that he did not know when a final decision on the project would be made.Earlier this month, French President Francois Hollande said he would like the project to go ahead.Hinkley Point C, which would provide 7% of the UK's total energy requirements, had originally been meant to open in 2017. But it has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project.While one third of the £18bn capital costs of the project are being met by Chinese investors, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company.In March, Thomas Piquemal, EDF's chief financial officer, quit after his proposal to delay the project by three years was rejected by colleagues.In April, French Energy Minister Ségolène Royale also suggested the project should be delayed.Much of this scepticism is the consequence of problems in constructing nuclear power stations to similar designs elsewhere. A plant being built by EDF at Flamanville in Normandy, northern France, has been hit by years of delays and spiralling costs. Furthermore, since the company is nationally owned, the decision is also subject to political pressure. A former energy adviser to the French government told Newsnight that while EDF did not technically need the backing of the trade union representatives, it would be very difficult, politically, to go ahead without it.Yves Marignac said: ""Going for it would for the government be crossing a red line in their relationship with the trade unions, which would make it really difficult for the government, particularly with the perspective of the next general election when they will need to get some support of the trade unions.""Making a decision for the project is not possible right now. The political costs and the costs for EDF's financial situation are too high right now."""

2016-05-24,Procurement costs 'slashed outside EU',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382197,"""Foolish"" EU procurement rules cost UK taxpayers £1.6bn a year, which could be better spent on new hospitals and flood defences, Leave campaigners have said.Existing laws imposed a big bureaucratic burden on companies, Vote Leave said, with no regard to the size of contracts or who was tendering.An estimated 1.9 million days were lost a year in red-tape delays, it added.But Remain campaigners said their opponents' wider economic arguments were ""falling apart"".Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the Leave team were ""becoming increasingly desperate"" and claimed the figures cited showed that Norway and Iceland, which are outside the EU, faced higher procurement costs than the UK. The British public will decide whether to vote to stay in the EU or leave in a referendum on 23 June.In other developments:On Wednesday the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the budgetary gains from leaving the EU could be outweighed by the subsequent economic damage while the head of the World Trade Organization said the UK could face £9bn in import tariffs outside the EU. As it seeks to turn the spotlight on the risks of remaining in the EU, Vote Leave has published new research it says shows the extent to which EU procurement processes are harming business competitiveness.Procurement laws, it says, are an integral part of the EU's internal market, from which it wants to withdraw. The threshold at which procurement legislation applies is set too low, it says, inhibiting businesses from bidding for contracts above that level, while the rules cover purely domestic tenders, including the bulk of government contracts, unrelated to foreign trade.The government, Vote Leave says, promised to alleviate the burden on private companies and public authorities of complying with the ""onerous"" rules - including the requirement to advertise all major tenders in EU publications and to read a 128-page code of contract regulations - but it did not feature in Mr Cameron's renegotiations of the UK's membership.How to follow BBC One's EU Referendum debateVote Leave says complying with EU rules has cost the British taxpayer £1.7bn in each of the past five years, funds which it says would pay for 25 new hospitals, 273,000 basic state pensions as well as increased spending on NHS drugs and road maintenance.It arrived at the figure of £8.4bn over five years by multiplying the amount spent by government on current and capital procurement every year and multiplying that by the estimated cost of EU compliance, taking into account inflation. Separate analysis suggests two million days have been lost in each of the past five years because of delays in finalising contracts. Vote Leave has cited a European Commission report in 2011 suggesting UK contracts took 193 days on average to progress from tender to award, longer than any other EU member apart from Greece and Malta. Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a leading Leave campaigner, has previously said EU procurement rules constrained government efforts to build new schools and refurbish existing ones when he was education secretary. Speaking on Thursday, he said: ""If we vote Leave, we can scrap the EU's foolish rules on how Whitehall runs procurement processes, which add billions to the cost of government every year,"" he said.""I've experienced firsthand in the Department for Education how these rules add significant operational costs and generate expensive delays to construction projects. ""Across Whitehall, there are billions to save after we vote Leave.""But the Leave campaign has been accused of overstating the amount that would be saved by leaving the single market and circumventing existing EU regulation.

2016-05-24,Warning over steel pension cut proposal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36384508,"The government has been warned that a plan to cut pension benefits to help save Tata Steel's UK operations could take ministers down a ""dangerous path"".Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb urged caution over ""rushed changes"" he said could have implications for workers ""well beyond the steel industry"".A £485m pension deficit has been deterring potential buyers of Tata.Ministers are considering changing the measure used for British Steel pension increases to cut its liabilities. The government is expected to propose basing the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the current Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure.Some union leaders are likely to support the proposals, the BBC understands.But Mark Turner of the Unite union cautioned that he wanted to see the detail.""We don't want to make changes if they're going to be detrimental to the rest of industry,"" he told the BBC.In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members; it is not clear how many of those would be affected by the plan.Further details are likely to emerge later when the government announces a consultation on the proposals in a written statement to the House of Commons.Former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: ""The government is going down a very dangerous path.""Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry.""The suggestion is that the new rules would stipulate that a company could only change their pension liabilities in an emergency. But, speaking to the BBC, Mr Webb said the term emergency was ""ill-defined"" and that companies could create them artificially in order to reduce their pension payouts.""Once there's a loophole that says you can walk away from promises you've made. Other [companies] could walk away,"" he said, adding that he thought there could also be legal challenges.Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said steel workers' pensions ""must be protected"".""If these reports are accurate, the secretary of state for work and pensions should come to the House to explain precisely what is being proposed, including how current and future steel pensioners will be affected and what precedents might be set by any changes to hard-won pension protection legislation,"" he added. The pension fund and its deficit have been a source of unease for the current owners Tata and a deal-breaker for any would-be buyers.Reducing its burden will make a sale easier and may even convince Tata to hang on to its UK steel business. Any such change would be very controversial as it would set what some would see as a dangerous precedent.The move is evidence of the business secretary's sense of urgency to resolve an industrial crisis which has put 10,000 steel workers' jobs in imminent danger. The BBC understands that union leaders have accepted that this proposal is a better deal than seeing the pension scheme shunted into the lifeboat of the Pensions Protection Fund, which can see some members lose 10% of their payout immediately and see lower increments in future years.  Who are the potential bidders?Jack: How Excalibur and Liberty could join forcesThe rise and fall of Britain's steel industryWhen asked about the proposal to cut the pension deficit, Business Minister Anna Soubry told Channel 4 News: ""We have always said we would do everything we can to look at pensions. ""The prime minister said 'no stone to be unturned' and that is exactly what has been done.""Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones told the programme that there were better ways of dealing with the scheme than putting it in the Pensions Protection Fund, which would take on the deficit, but would also result in members losing some of their benefits.""The UK government has more levers it can pull than we can with its control of the tax system and pensions legislation,"" he said.Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Mr Jones visited Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata executives.It was thought the company might announce a shortlist of bidders, but Tata would only say that bids were still under ""active consideration"".Are you a steelworker?

The biggest single donation was £850,000 from International Motors Ltd. The various campaigns for the UK to remain in the EU collectively declared £1,573,402 over the same period, the bulk of which was raised by Britain Stronger In Europe.Its largest donations were both for £250,000, one from the Bet365 group and one from Mark Coombs.The group said it had received an ""excellent response from across the UK"", with more than 13,000 donations of £50 or less.But it said the difference in amounts raised ""highlights the hypocrisy of the deep-pocketed Leave campaigns and their claims about 'the establishment', which will ring increasingly hollow as it becomes apparent how well-funded they are"".Vote Leave has said it is in a ""David and Goliath"" fight against the Remain camp - pointing to banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have funded the campaign. It has also accused Ryanair of breaking electoral law in its pro-EU campaign.On Thursday, a spokesman for Vote Leave said the Remain campaign could ""still rely on the big banks to fill their coffers"" but the public were being ""turned off by a campaign to do down the British economy"".""The fact that funding is drying up for the In campaign shows that the financial support for 'Project Fear' is collapsing,"" the Vote Leave spokesman said."

The airline dubbed the campaign ""Leave loonies"".The UK votes on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.Chancellor George Osborne, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Liberal Democrat Sir Vince Cable gave speeches making the case for remaining in the EU in front of a sign-written aircraft at Ryanair's base at Stansted Airport.It has been reported that Ryanair intends to spend €25,000 (£18,980) on a campaign for Remain. It has offered discounted flights to passengers who want to fly home to vote to stay in the EU.The airline may be able to disregard the spending rules as it is registered as a company in Ireland. A Ryanair spokesman told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: ""The Leave campaign must be getting really desperate if they're objecting to low-fare air travel for British citizens.""With less than four weeks to go, we will continue to work hard to help deliver a resounding Remain majority on 23 June - and ensure that the Leave loonies don't ban low-fare air travel too.""An Electoral Commission spokesman said it had ""received a complaint from Vote Leave regarding the campaigning activity of Ryanair at the EU referendum"".It added: ""We are establishing the facts before determining what, if any, further steps to take.""Earlier in May, Vote Leave reported Ryanair to the Metropolitan Police accusing it of bribery for offering discounted flights home to Remain voters - a suggestion rejected by Ryanair, which announced it would extend its offer.A series of major companies have given the Remain campaign their public backing but only the recruitment firm Adecco, a TV documentary producer and an advertising firm are registered campaigners so far.Adecco said it had registered because it had sponsored a single panel event with a think tank."

2016-05-24,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-24,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-24,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."
2016-05-24,Is it 'workin'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380007,"The battle between the Remain and Leave sides in the EU referendum is in full swing and social media is being used by both camps to try to win the race.Younger voters have so far been slower to register to vote and campaigners are keen to win their attention and support.Some strategies have enjoyed surprise success while others have misfired completely. The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be. As PR strategy consultant Deborah Mattinson says: ""Social media campaigns need to be totally spot on or it's absolutely awful.""Compiled by Zak Brophy"

2016-05-24,Success and failure,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36370560,"Adam Lang, the fictional British Prime Minister in Robert Harris' novel The Ghost faces prosecution for war crimes in an international court. Lang is not so much a thinly veiled portrait of Tony Blair as an explicitly, obviously exotic extension, with added warts and delusions, of our former prime minister.Now, according to one Sunday newspaper, the Chilcot inquiry could, in reality, accuse Tony Bair of such crimes. The added spice is that while Lang merely faced his former foreign secretary, current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would apparently back Blair's prosecution at the Hague. No novelist would be quite so obvious as to cast his revenging fury as a current party leader, the very embodiment of all his victim had exiled from mainstream politics. The Ghost indeed.The Labour Party is still haunted by the manifest success and equally spectacular failure of Tony Blair. Mr Blair has just suggested that simple lessons should be learnt about genies and bottles, saying: ""We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and that would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime.""Chilcot may not be as dramatic as the weekend headlines suggest, but it is still very far from ancient history. What is the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war for?Iraq Inquiry: Timeline of key momentsThe legacy of the Iraq War is a critical part of the vital, current debate within the Labour party. Still, Mr Blair looms too large for his erstwhile supporters to either praise him or bury him. Crucially, the road to Baghdad was paved with political ambitions for his party.One was dealing with the outsized fear, after 9/11, of enemies getting hold of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The mingling of realistic fears, the actual facts and convenient fantasy is what Chilcot has to disentangle, and there will be plenty of time to chew over the findings.What may get lost is the wider context of Mr Blair's enthusiasm for action.Central to Mr Blair's transformation of the Labour Party was killing off negative perceptions that the party was ""too left wing"" for power. He didn't bother to dispute the accusations of a hostile press and the worries of swing voters - instead his technique was to flamboyantly adopt policies that spoke loudly of their opposite. In one area, he saw a double lock on Labour's door to power - the claims it was:Both had deep roots, from the pacifism of party leader George Lansbury in the 1930s to protests over Vietnam in the 1960s.But more important was CND in the 1980s and a view of the world that saw the US not as a valiant bulwark in a Cold War against tyranny, but the inheritor of an Western imperial legacy, giving succour to dictators and oppressors who made the world safe to sell Coca-Cola. Jeremy Corbyn was firmly, prominently, consistently one of those who saw the ills of the world through the lens of American imperial power. Mr Blair thought the world needed that power, almost irrespective of its actual actions.Curious as it seems in retrospect, he feared that George W Bush (pre-9/11) would disengage the US from the world. An enthusiastic ""liberal interventionist"", as set out in his Chicago speech, Tony Blair realised the US was an essential part of his vision of a West that righted wrongs with enthusiasm and military power. As he has made clear since, he didn't just go along with President Bush.""It's worse than you think,"" he said. ""I believe in it. I am truly committed to dealing with this, irrespective of the position of America.""If the Americans were not doing this, I would be pressing for them to be doing so."" He is still at it, urging a new ground war in Syria and Iraq, involving the UK, US and France.Born: 6 May 1953Educated: Choristers school, Fettes, OxfordFamily: Married, four children1976: Barrister specialising in trade union and employment law1983: Labour MP for Sedgefield, shadow City spokesman1984-87: Shadow trade and industry minister1987-88: Shadow energy secretary1989-92: Shadow employment secretary1992-94: Shadow home secretary1994-97: Opposition leader1997-2007: Prime minister, winning three successive general elections2007-2015: Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East2008: Launched the Tony Blair Faith FoundationAfter Mr Blair, after Iraq Labour supporters could bitterly, wryly, reflect that their party had put to bed forever the idea that it was weak on defence, such was his enthusiasm for offensive action. Except that is no longer true. We are witnessing the same old debates, the same old questions, about Trident, about Nato, about military spending. And perhaps that is appropriate. But it is not very helpful for the Labour party itself to be squabbling in the past tense.On the eve of the Iraq War, I reflected that we were sailing into uncharted waters - a British prime minister taking a country into a war, that as far as one can tell, the population didn't want. A war against the will of the people. It could have turned out differently, perhaps. But no WMD were found, and the occupation was both occasionally brutal and usually incompetent. New Labour staggered on, but those who had always mistrusted Mr Blair found a fitting locus for their dislike.Party members and voters peeled off, so slowly, but so certainly.His behaviour out of office has made him even more of a hate figure for some on the left. Although he is the ghost who haunts the party's halls, he is a very bouncy, upbeat, jet-setting sort of spirit - defiantly unapologetic, made extravagantly rich in part, some say, by consorting with questionable regimes. I can't be the only one who sees something of Mr Blair in Hugh Laurie's brilliant portrayal of Richard Roper in the Night Manager - not that anyone's suggesting Mr Blair is a corrupt arms dealer, its just there's something familiar about his breezy, easy way with power, wealth and entourage.Wherever Mr Corbyn's subsequent career takes him, it is impossible to imagine him following these footsteps. It is only one of the myriad ways in which he is the austere anti-Blair. Not, however, Mr Blair's exorcist, but his primal antithesis, all the tribe's most atavistic instincts reanimated, all that Mr Blair buried, resurrected.  He will not lay the family ghost.The leadership may despise Mr Blair's techniques for winning power - but they haven't yet found their own.Part of Mr Blair's skill was in the much-mocked art of triangulation, rising above left and right, to hover somewhere not only midway between the two, but with a certain degree of moral altitude above both. No-one in the Labour party has yet attempted this between Mr Blair and Mr Corbyn. It is perhaps too soon. But the world does not wait. The lessons drawn from Iraq by a former senior civil servant may be clear by the late summer, but the foreign policy debate generally grows ever more complex.It is too early for Labour to deal with its devils, but it will probably means it will be stuck in a black-and-white debate in an increasingly multi-hued world."
2016-05-24,Nick Robinson,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378655,"A pinch of cardamom, a little coriander and a smattering of cinnamon - all ingredients not just in a great British curry but in a political row that's been bubbling up in the kitchens of Indian restaurants up and down the country. It begins with a question - where is the next generation of curry chefs going to come from - and ends in with another - would leaving the EU save your local Indian from closing? Currently two or three curry restaurants are shutting every week. Now, you may think you know the answer to where Indian chefs come from. If so think again. For decades your ""Indian"" - whether a chicken tikka masala or late night vindaloo - was almost certainly cooked by a chef from Bangladesh or, perhaps, someone whose father was.  Not any more though. The voices you hear in a growing number of kitchens above the noise of the chopping and the sizzling are the voices of East Europeans - in particular Romanians. The reason is that tougher immigration rules mean it simply costs too much for most restaurants to bring new chefs over here. White thug poster aimed at ethnic minority votersPolls reveal divided nationEthnic minorities could be key, says UKIPA decade or so ago a curry chef would earn around £15,000 a year. Now, a restaurant has to pay almost double that as well as jumping a series of complex bureaucratic hurdles to persuade the Home Office to allow them to bring in a chef from abroad. ""Abroad"" means, of course, not from outside the UK but outside the EU.Pasha Khandakar, the president of the Bangladesh Caterers Association, told me that this was an ""immigration double standard"".""We've been told by British ministers to import European Union people,"" he said, pointing to a ""language problem, a culture problem and a smell problem."" He contends that Eastern European workers dislike the smell of curries. ""We have to give chance for everyone in this world who's fit for these jobs - not for their colour, not for their geographical identity.""""Why should it be easier and cheaper to hire a Romanian to work in a curry house than a Bangladeshi?"" many British Asians ask. Why, indeed, should it be so easy for Eastern Europeans to bring their families to live with them when it is now so much harder than it once was for the families of British people with Commonwealth roots to do the same? It is the widespread feeling that immigration rules now discriminate against them and their families which Brexit campaigners have sought to tap into. Indeed, the employment minister and prominent Leave campaigner, Priti Patel, has claimed that a vote to quit the EU is the only way to save the curry industry.That depends on a very big assumption. That following Brexit the British public would become so relaxed about immigration that politicians felt able to relax the immigration rules that stop low paid and low skilled workers coming here from elsewhere. At Le Raj in Epsom - an upmarket restaurant in Surrey which is a favourite of Chris Tarrant and Heston Blumenthal - that's not how they see things. The head chef here is a Bangladeshi. Recently he's had to brush up on his language skills - to learn not English but Romanian. His kitchen is manned now by people who had never smelt a curry never mind cooked one before coming to work under his tutelage. The boss of the Raj, Jeffrey Ali, is as frustrated as anyone in his industry with the current immigration rules but he tells me that he simply does not believe any politician will want ""to touch relaxing the rules with a 10 foot pole"". ""If immigration were to be brought down, even by half, there would still be no onus from any politician to say, 'Ok now because we have less people coming from the EU, let's bring in more people from the Commonwealth,'"" said Mr Ali, who plans to vote Remain in the referendum. Not least when unemployment is high amongst the British Bangladeshi community whose children choose, he argues, to claim benefit rather than to take the relatively low pay and long hours that their parents once worked as waiters or chefs. Brexit, he believes, offers a false dawn for an industry that needs to do more to raise its status and to train the next generation of chefs. Jeffrey Ali is helping to sponsor a new academy down the road to teach cooking to young British born people in the hope that one day he will not be forced to choose between immigrants he cannot afford and those who know as much about curry as he knows about Romanian cuisine.Immigration is the main reason people who plan to Vote Leave give for their choice. What's clear, though, is that even if we do vote to quit the EU on the 23rd June the debate about how much immigration we need and want and can afford as a country will stay firmly on the menu alongside  the question - who will cook and serve my Indian in the future?"
2016-05-24,The Great Escape?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382206,"Welcome aboard the top deck of an open top Daimler Fleet Line double decker.A jalopy of such vintage, I'm told, Torvill and Dean used it for a victory parade in Nottingham in 1984. And it was in its second decade then.In an era of airtight political choreography, this is a campaign that's sufficiently breezy that the party leader shouts ""duck"" on the upper deck as we all get whacked by branches when the bus goes under some trees.Think what you like about the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but two things from this vantage point seem indisputable. This referendum is happening because of the impact he's had on British politics.And who else at Westminster is up for the kind of campaigning he does?Arriving in Chapeltown, just north of Sheffield, the loudspeakers gaffer taped onto the upper deck are turned on. Eager members of the small Team Farage are instructed to cling on to said speakers, such is the fear that gravity might triumph over them.The music to The Great Escape pumps out, to a Farage chuckle; a joke the veteran MEP can't resist. The response as the bus slows is binary: from the Anglo Saxon unbroadcastable insult, hollered with gusto, to the thumbs up and smile from the nonagenarian woman at the bus stop.Pulling up outside the Wagon and Horses, Mr Farage is the unlikely voice of temporary prohibition. It's just gone 10am and he had been after a coffee; some of his activists were necking lager half an hour earlier.He leaps off the bus and starts chatting. Sure, these affairs attract the converted, the committed, the convinced. Even the evangelical.Bits of slogan-emblazoned cardboard aloft, some approach him as if Bono or Bieber have rolled up. Kisses, autographs, all the rest of it.But he has a crack too at passers by, the unconvinced, the unconverted, but persuadable. And one or two who have no intention of being persuaded at all. Mr Farage appears to be attempting to take on the crater-sized criticism screamed at him by his opponents also wanting the UK to vote to leave the EU.Their critique is simple: he can motivate those who agree with him, but he's toxic amongst those who don't, and don't yet. The big question is this: given his binary appeal, are they right? His argument is this: look how many people I've won over so far.They argue this is a race to get half of those who vote, plus one more. Can he convince those crucial floating voters?Lunch, as you might have guessed, is at a pub. High on Saddleworth Moor, the Rams Head flies a St George's flag in the car park.His persuading and charming, arguing and chatting, continues with whoever he meets. By two o'clock we are back on the vintage bus.Whatever you do, don't ask for the wifi code or where the toilet is. A corkscrew appears. Briefly entertaining the idea that, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang like, it might be to get the charabanc going again, I ask what it's for.The Rioja appears. After all, we are half an hour down the M62 away from the next campaign stop in Bolton. So let's be clear: you might have noticed this was an entertaining, engaging and refreshing day on the campaign trail. Refreshing, indeed, in all sorts of ways. But here are the big questions: Does Nigel Farage change minds among the unconvinced to win a referendum? Or do too many people simply not like him?It's a massive unanswered question. Can an approach to politics - as different as his is - actually lead it to the very highest success?Can a man who has turbo charged an outfit from a dusty room in the London School of Economics into a major player in British politics, actually achieve the only thing he ever set out to do - get the UK out of the EU?And, afterwards, whether win or lose, what on earth does he do next?"

2016-05-24,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

2016-05-25,Scots vote 'within two years of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36393483,"Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has said he would expect another referendum on Scottish independence within two years of a Brexit vote, in a BBC EU debate.He said if Scotland is ""dragged out"" of the EU ""against our will"" on 23 June, he believed there would be another vote - and it would back independence. But Conservative Liam Fox said the EU vote should not be ""stoked by fear"" of a second Scottish referendum.Voters aged 18-to-29 took part in the BBC debate in Glasgow.Ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, the at-times feisty debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - also included Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU, and UKIP's Diane James, who is campaigning for a Leave vote.Former First Minister Mr Salmond, who backs remaining in the EU, told the audience a second Scottish independence referendum ""would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw"" from the EU, should it vote to leave.He said: ""If you had the situation where Scotland, in four weeks' time, votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.""""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""But Leave supporter Mr Fox accused Mr Salmond of ""yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum"".Mr Fox said: ""I have never been very sure what the SNP didn't understand about the result - the Scottish people voted to stay in the UK.""He said the EU referendum was ""a decision that we take as the UK... every vote counts.""It's a decision for all the people in the UK and we should take it on the merits of the European Union debate and not be sidetracked into yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum.""BBC political correspondent Iain WatsonIt was lively. It was feisty. And that was just the audience.The BBC referendum debate gathered together 18 to 29-year-olds from all over the UK to hear four panellists, the youngest of whom - 54-year-old Liam Fox - was a quarter of a century older than the oldest member of the audience.But the most striking contribution came from 60-something Alex Salmond. The former first minister of Scotland didn't just want to talk about this referendum, but the next one.Read more from Iain.During a wide-ranging discussion, the audience criticised both campaigns for using the economy and immigration to ""get the emotions ramped up"". Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the ""scaremongering"" material put out by the Treasury on the Remain side, adding: ""It wouldn't be economic apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more chances if we stay in.""He said: ""That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose.""To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case.""Some of the young voters taking part criticised ""tit-for-tat"" attacks during the campaign, describing it as ""petty name-calling"" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been ""appalling"".She said there had been a focus on migration ""on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government.. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy"". Other issues raised during the debate included travel, the NHS, house prices and jobs. Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, Mr Fox said: ""Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after.""Why do we have these arrangements? Because it is genuinely in the interests of both parties to do so.""But Labour's Mr Johnson said: ""At the moment, we have a very beneficial system we can go anywhere within the EU, it's a two-way process...""There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are you going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas.""He added: ""Unless you put a border and watchtowers across the borders between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, you're going to have people coming across there because you're going to have an EU country and a non-EU country."" Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, UKIP's Ms James said: ""We just don't know"".She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a ""Plan B""."

2016-05-25,G7 leaders warn of Brexit risk to growth,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394905,"A declaration at the G7 meeting in Japan says a vote by the UK to leave the European Union would pose a ""serious threat to global growth"".In its final statement, the group warned that a UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend of increased global trade, investment and jobs. The meeting brings together the world's leading seven industrialised nations. The final communiqué set global growth as a priority for dealing with threats to the world's economy and security.But the warning about the economic consequences of the UK leaving the European Union comes as Britain prepares for a referendum on 23 June. Prime Minister David Cameron has been campaigning for Britain to stay within the 28-country bloc with recent polls suggesting a lead for those who support remaining within the EU. The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideAnalysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondentThat Brexit has been seen as a serious risk to the world economy at the G7 shouldn't surprise anyone. The G7 finance ministers meeting over the weekend in Sendai came to the same conclusion - and it was what the Japanese Central Bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told me in an interview earlier this week. What is surprising is how much of an impact this communique says a yes vote will have on global growth - jobs, investment and trade will be affected. But it's also sentiment - investors are nervous about what Brexit will mean for confidence in Europe and how it will change the landscape of the world economy. No one likes uncertainty, and with 26 days left before the referendum, expect a lot more of these sorts of global statements.After two days of talks, the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan set global growth as an ""urgent priority.""The group pledged to ""collectively tackle"" major risks to global growth, including threats to the international order from terrorist attacks and violent extremism.The statement promised to commit ""to strengthening... policy responses in a cooperative manner and to employing a more forceful and balanced policy mix, in order to swiftly achieve a strong, sustainable and balanced growth pattern"".""We remain committed to ensuring that growth is inclusive and job-rich, benefiting all segments of our societies,"" the document added. They also called for international markets to be kept open to fight all forms of protectionism and for countries to avoid competitive devaluations of their currencies.The G7 has also released an action plan to counter terrorism which they hope will close ""critical gaps"" in capacity and international cooperation. Aside from stepping up information sharing between countries and Interpol, they also said they would improve border control and aviation security. The communiqué described the migrant crisis in Europe ""as a global challenge which requires a global response"" of increased aid from international financial institutions and donor countries.The statement went on to express ""concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas"" where maritime disputes have lead to increasing regional tensions over the past years.  While there is no mention of China and its expansion into territorially disputed waters specifically, the document calls for respecting freedom of navigation and for resolving conflicts peacefully through law."
2016-05-25,UK set to send second warship to Libya,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394597,"The UK is set to send another warship to the Mediterranean to help tackle people-smuggling and movements of arms in and out of Libya, officials say.David Cameron told the G7 summit in Japan that the UK was ready to take an ""active leadership role"" in helping Libya deal with trafficking. The UK currently has one survey vessel, HMS Enterprise, operating in the area.For the UK to send another warship, the EU will need to extend the mandate of its current naval operation.UK officials at this week's meeting of G7 industrialised nations said they would seek UN approval so that the new warship could also seize boats suspected of smuggling arms to fighters of so-called Islamic State in Libya. Last Sunday the new Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli asked the European Union for more help in training its navy and coastguard to stop the trafficking of migrants across the Mediterranean.It is thought this may soon be followed by a request for international ships to operate in Libyan waters.If this request is received, the UK will seek the extension of the EU's Operation Sophia mission to tackle people-trafficking in the central Mediterranean, as well as a Security Council resolution at the UN enabling its forces to assist in the interception of arms shipments.This week the UK sent four military planners to the Rome headquarters of Operation Sophia, with the goal of preparing a plan to improve the effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard.Downing Street did not say what type of Royal Navy ship would be sent and declined to discuss what evidence it had for illicit arms movements from the Libyan coast.Mr Cameron first put forward the idea of extending Operation Sophia into Libyan territorial waters at a Brussels summit of the EU in March.He warned that the number of migrants attempting to cross via the central Mediterranean could be expected to swell once the alternative route through Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans had been closed."
2016-05-25,Hundreds more terror records deleted,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394494,"Errors that led to fingerprint and DNA records of hundreds of terror suspects being deleted were more widespread than thought, it has emerged. The Biometrics Commissioner said two months ago that 450 profiles had been wrongly deleted from a police database in England and Wales. But in an updated report, Alastair MacGregor revealed the figure was 810. The Home Office, which released the report, said steps were being taken to fix the issue. Under a new system introduced in 2013, DNA and fingerprint profiles of people who are not convicted of a crime have to be removed from a counter-terrorism database. However, the records can be kept in the interests of national security - such as in cases where someone has been suspected of having links to terrorism - when a senior officer makes a national security determination (NSD).But Mr MacGregor said the 810 profiles had been deleted because police officers had failed to make NSD applications in time.He found that in at least 108 cases there would have been national security grounds to store the data and the records ""could and should have been retained"".He added: ""It is obviously very important that steps quickly be taken to establish whether - and, if so, how - replacement material should be obtained from those individuals and/or other action should be taken to minimise any risk which they pose to national security.""Mr MacGregor also revised upwards the number of people on British counter-terrorism databases who have not been convicted of a ""recordable"" offence, from 3,800 to 4,500.However, he said he was ""broadly satisfied"" that the issues he raised were being addressed.A Home Office spokesman said: ""The commissioner has concluded that steps are being taken to address these issues, and the police have provided further assurances that they will be kept under close review.""The government's full response to the commissioner's annual report will be published in due course.""Source: Biometrics Commissioner's annual report, 2015, and Home Office and National DNA database annual report"
2016-05-25,Treasury warns of 'Brexit pension hit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36393513,"The Treasury has warned that millions of current and future pensioners will be worse off if the UK leaves the European Union.Its analysis suggests Brexit would cause inflation to rise, eroding the value of state pension increases, costing recipients £137 a year.Those with an additional pension pot worth £60,000 would see its value drop by £1,900, the Treasury said.However, Vote Leave said the analysis was ""utterly outrageous"".Former Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for Vote Leave, said: ""This is an utterly outrageous attempt by the government to do down people's pensions and is little more than a cynical attempt to distract from the government's broken promises on immigration.""""The biggest threat to British pensions is the European Commission's proposals to undermine occupational pensions, which the government themselves have described as 'damaging and reckless'.""Meanwhile, tax proposals from Eurozone countries will wipe billions off British assets hitting pension funds hardest,"" he said.The Treasury analysis also looked at the impact Brexit would have on someone aged 50.Its analysis found that an individual with pension savings of £20,000, who is contributing 8% of their earnings into a pension fund between now and 2030, would be between £223 and £335 a year worse off in retirement.Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Much of the [Brexit] debate so far has focused on the potential economic fallout of a vote for Leave for those now in work, in terms of the impact on their jobs. ""But it's important that pensioners understand what's at stake for them too on 23 June.""Pensioners who have worked hard all their lives deserve dignity, security and certainty in retirement. That's what we all hope for and what any responsible government should seek to provide,"" the Chancellor said.Pensions minister Baroness Altmann, told the BBC's Today programme, that there was a ""consensus"" among major economic bodies such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the OECD, the head of the IMF and the Bank of England  that the British economy would be weaker if there was a vote to leave the EU.""I have looked at pensions for years. If there is uncertainty, markets do not do well. If there is economic weakness companies cannot do well and that means your investments in pensions and the amount of money put in pensions will fall,"" she added.Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy, Hargreaves Lansdown said such forecasting was ""ambitious"".""The Treasury paints a fairly apocalyptic picture of widespread reductions in retirement incomes. ""The key assumptions they make are of higher inflation and lower economic growth; both of these assumptions may be open to challenge by the Leave campaign. ""Change the underlying assumptions and you change the outcomes."" The state pension has been subjected to a triple lock since 2010, ensuring it rises each year by whichever is higher - inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.He said at the moment state pensioners were receiving annual increases above the rate of inflation.Higher prices would erode this benefit, but because state pension increases are pegged to inflation their standard of living would be maintained.Mr McPhail said higher prices are likely to be more of a problem for some final salary pensions and many individual annuities that are not fully inflation-proofed.""Higher inflation could therefore undermine the real value of these incomes.""However we also note that a rise in bond yields following a Leave vote could equally have a significant beneficial impact on final salary scheme deficits.""He said a recent survey by fund managers conducted by Hargreaves Lansdown on the impact of Brexit, found the majority agreed it would mean lower GDP over 1 to 2 years, but more than a fifth suggested it could be higher in 5-10 years. In the longer term they forecast Brexit would have no impact on the economy."
2016-05-25,"Net migration to UK rises to 333,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382199,"Net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates - the second highest figure on record.Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high.Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been ""cynical"" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK was part of the EU.Speaking to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Conservative MP and former London Mayor said it was ""cynical and unacceptable to say you can fulfil that pledge"".""I think that they (the figures) show the scandal of the promise made by politicians repeatedly that they could cut immigration to the tens of thousands and then to throw their hands up in the air and say there's nothing we can do because Brussels has taken away our control of immigration,"" he said.Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU in June's referendum, said he was pro-immigration but there was ""no public consent for the scale of immigration we are seeing"" and the situation was ""completely out of control"".He said that the only solution was to leave the EU, saying that a vote to stay in the union would mean people ""kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration"".Laura Kuenssberg said the immigration figures ""could hardly have come at a more sensitive time, just when the referendum campaign is moving into a more brutal and frantic phase"".Home Office minister James Brokenshire said David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU, which will see restrictions placed on the benefits new arrivals can claim and a crackdown on ""sham marriages"", would ""close back-door routes"" into the country. ""Leaving the EU is absolutely no panacea or silver bullet,"" he added, telling BBC News that net migration from outside the EU was higher than from within it and leaving would ""wreck the economy and harm jobs"". In other developments, with four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June on whether to stay in or leave the EU:According to the Office for National Statistics, there was a 20,000 rise in net migration to the UK from the 313,000 for the year to December 2014.The figure is well above the government's aim of getting it to the ""tens of thousands"" and is the highest recorded for a calendar year.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.A Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether Mr Cameron remained committed to that target but said the government would ""continue to look at what more might be done"".The spokesman added: ""Of course people rightly have concerns on immigration but the PM's view is very clearly that wrecking the economy and destroying jobs by getting rid of our privileged access to the world's biggest market is not the answer.""He said the Leave campaign failed to spell out what would happen to migration if the UK left the EU, with some saying ""they will cut migration while telling other groups that they will keep freedom of movement or increase visas"".Thursday's figures show estimated levels of long-term migration into the UK from within the EU and outside in the year to December 2015.They show that 270,000 EU citizens moved to the UK for at least a year in 2015, up from 264,000 in 2014. The number of non-EU citizens moving to the UK was 277,000, down from 287,000 in 2014.The rise in the net figure was the result of a fall in the numbers of people emigrating.Analysis By Home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe net migration figure is just short of the record but that statistic alone doesn't do justice to the global picture and the UK's place in it. Everywhere you look, people are on the move - coming and going depending on economic and political circumstances. EU immigration is relatively stable - although there are more southern Europeans than before thanks to the Eurozone's economic doldrums. One really interesting figure, that doesn't affect the population headcount - officially at least - is the 110,000 rise in short-term immigration to about 1.2m. More people are coming for less than a year - such as short contract workers selected by employers who are looking internationally for the best people at the most competitive price. But it will also include some Brits who spend part of the year here - and the rest living in the sun. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the numbers show ""mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU, going on with disastrous open borders"".But former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett warned that an agreement with France to allow British border controls at Calais and the Eurostar terminals in Paris and Brussels would be at risk if Britain left the EU. He criticised Leave campaigners for wanting to create a ""fortress Britain"" - and defended the last Labour government's record immigration, saying ""We didn't just simply say to Poles coming in back in 2004, just come here, we said we'd rather you come here and work than be in the sub-economy."" He added: ""40% of those who registered to work back in 2004 were already in the country and the reason I make that point is because a lot of people would come in illegally if we didn't have the border controls on French soil.""  The Institute of Directors said the public was ""being very poorly served by the current level of the debate on immigration"" and people came to work in the UK because it is one of ""best performing economies in Europe"".""Employment is at a record high, and there are big skills gaps that employers cannot fill domestically. Despite the overblown rhetoric that today's figures have sparked, the actual numbers have not changed much in the last year,"" said IoD employment spokesman Seamus Nevin.Other ONS figures on employment show:How to follow the BBC One EU referendum debate"
2016-05-25,French unions oppose Hinkley Point,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394601,"The future of the planned new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point remains in doubt as key French unions still oppose the project, BBC Newsnight has learned. EDF, which would build the plant, had delayed a decision on the project in Somerset until the summer while it consulted French union representatives.The company, which is 85% French state-owned, had hoped to win support from a committee of workplace representatives. But the committee said staff had not been reassured about the plant's costs.Trade union representatives hold six of the 18 seats on EDF's board.Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of the Central Works Committee that EDF consulted with, told Newsnight that staff feared the cost of the project would cripple EDF.He said: ""We have reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation, and procurement.""The trade unions are unlikely to give their blessing to the project in its current state. All you need to know about Hinkley Point""We are not reassured by the documents we have received. We have been given a marketing folder, not the full information we require.""We got the documents on 9 May - we are sending EDF a request for more explanations.""On Monday French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron wrote to MPs on Westminster's energy select committee to reassure them the French government remained committed to the project.But Mr Macron added: ""It is also necessary, in the interests of all, that EDF follows due process before committing itself to an investment of this magnitude. ""The consultation of the Central Works Committee brings legal robustness on the decision.""EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz also told MPs on the committee that he did not know when a final decision on the project would be made.Earlier this month, French President Francois Hollande said he would like the project to go ahead.Hinkley Point C, which would provide 7% of the UK's total energy requirements, had originally been meant to open in 2017. But it has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project.While one third of the £18bn capital costs of the project are being met by Chinese investors, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company.In March, Thomas Piquemal, EDF's chief financial officer, quit after his proposal to delay the project by three years was rejected by colleagues.In April, French Energy Minister Ségolène Royale also suggested the project should be delayed.Much of this scepticism is the consequence of problems in constructing nuclear power stations to similar designs elsewhere. A plant being built by EDF at Flamanville in Normandy, northern France, has been hit by years of delays and spiralling costs. Furthermore, since the company is nationally owned, the decision is also subject to political pressure. A former energy adviser to the French government told Newsnight that while EDF did not technically need the backing of the trade union representatives, it would be very difficult, politically, to go ahead without it.Yves Marignac said: ""Going for it would for the government be crossing a red line in their relationship with the trade unions, which would make it really difficult for the government, particularly with the perspective of the next general election when they will need to get some support of the trade unions.""Making a decision for the project is not possible right now. The political costs and the costs for EDF's financial situation are too high right now."""

These people turned up at the event intent on causing disruption.""When our team left the area, the gorilla was still in good spirits and dancing around and didn't look like he had been punched.""The man in the gorilla suit claims he was elbowed in the ribs and punched in the face by a man who was screaming at him.The other man, local Lib Dem candidate John Romero, described the attitude of Leave supporters as ""an absolute disgrace, beyond belief"".He claims he was pushed two metres down steps of the historic Buttercross as he tried to heckle Mr Johnson's speech. Police are appealing for witnesses and are examining photographic evidence of both assaults. "
2016-05-25,Procurement costs 'slashed outside EU',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382197,"""Foolish"" EU procurement rules cost UK taxpayers £1.6bn a year, which could be better spent on new hospitals and flood defences, Leave campaigners have said.Existing laws imposed a big bureaucratic burden on companies, Vote Leave said, with no regard to the size of contracts or who was tendering.An estimated 1.9 million days were lost a year in red-tape delays, it added.But Remain campaigners said their opponents' wider economic arguments were ""falling apart"".Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the Leave team were ""becoming increasingly desperate"" and claimed the figures cited showed that Norway and Iceland, which are outside the EU, faced higher procurement costs than the UK. The British public will decide whether to vote to stay in the EU or leave in a referendum on 23 June.In other developments:On Wednesday the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the budgetary gains from leaving the EU could be outweighed by the subsequent economic damage while the head of the World Trade Organization said the UK could face £9bn in import tariffs outside the EU. As it seeks to turn the spotlight on the risks of remaining in the EU, Vote Leave has published new research it says shows the extent to which EU procurement processes are harming business competitiveness.Procurement laws, it says, are an integral part of the EU's internal market, from which it wants to withdraw. The threshold at which procurement legislation applies is set too low, it says, inhibiting businesses from bidding for contracts above that level, while the rules cover purely domestic tenders, including the bulk of government contracts, unrelated to foreign trade.The government, Vote Leave says, promised to alleviate the burden on private companies and public authorities of complying with the ""onerous"" rules - including the requirement to advertise all major tenders in EU publications and to read a 128-page code of contract regulations - but it did not feature in Mr Cameron's renegotiations of the UK's membership.How to follow BBC One's EU Referendum debateVote Leave says complying with EU rules has cost the British taxpayer £1.7bn in each of the past five years, funds which it says would pay for 25 new hospitals, 273,000 basic state pensions as well as increased spending on NHS drugs and road maintenance.It arrived at the figure of £8.4bn over five years by multiplying the amount spent by government on current and capital procurement every year and multiplying that by the estimated cost of EU compliance, taking into account inflation. Separate analysis suggests two million days have been lost in each of the past five years because of delays in finalising contracts. Vote Leave has cited a European Commission report in 2011 suggesting UK contracts took 193 days on average to progress from tender to award, longer than any other EU member apart from Greece and Malta. Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a leading Leave campaigner, has previously said EU procurement rules constrained government efforts to build new schools and refurbish existing ones when he was education secretary. Speaking on Thursday, he said: ""If we vote Leave, we can scrap the EU's foolish rules on how Whitehall runs procurement processes, which add billions to the cost of government every year,"" he said.""I've experienced firsthand in the Department for Education how these rules add significant operational costs and generate expensive delays to construction projects. ""Across Whitehall, there are billions to save after we vote Leave.""But the Leave campaign has been accused of overstating the amount that would be saved by leaving the single market and circumventing existing EU regulation.

2016-05-25,Warning over steel pension cut proposal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36384508,"The government has been warned that a plan to cut pension benefits to help save Tata Steel's UK operations could take ministers down a ""dangerous path"".Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb urged caution over ""rushed changes"" he said could have implications for workers ""well beyond the steel industry"".A £485m pension deficit has been deterring potential buyers of Tata.Ministers are considering changing the measure used for British Steel pension increases to cut its liabilities. The government is expected to propose basing the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the current Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure.Some union leaders are likely to support the proposals, the BBC understands.But Mark Turner of the Unite union cautioned that he wanted to see the detail.""We don't want to make changes if they're going to be detrimental to the rest of industry,"" he told the BBC.In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members; it is not clear how many of those would be affected by the plan.Further details are likely to emerge later when the government announces a consultation on the proposals in a written statement to the House of Commons.Former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: ""The government is going down a very dangerous path.""Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry.""The suggestion is that the new rules would stipulate that a company could only change their pension liabilities in an emergency. But, speaking to the BBC, Mr Webb said the term emergency was ""ill-defined"" and that companies could create them artificially in order to reduce their pension payouts.""Once there's a loophole that says you can walk away from promises you've made. Other [companies] could walk away,"" he said, adding that he thought there could also be legal challenges.Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said steel workers' pensions ""must be protected"".""If these reports are accurate, the secretary of state for work and pensions should come to the House to explain precisely what is being proposed, including how current and future steel pensioners will be affected and what precedents might be set by any changes to hard-won pension protection legislation,"" he added. The pension fund and its deficit have been a source of unease for the current owners Tata and a deal-breaker for any would-be buyers.Reducing its burden will make a sale easier and may even convince Tata to hang on to its UK steel business. Any such change would be very controversial as it would set what some would see as a dangerous precedent.The move is evidence of the business secretary's sense of urgency to resolve an industrial crisis which has put 10,000 steel workers' jobs in imminent danger. The BBC understands that union leaders have accepted that this proposal is a better deal than seeing the pension scheme shunted into the lifeboat of the Pensions Protection Fund, which can see some members lose 10% of their payout immediately and see lower increments in future years.  Who are the potential bidders?Jack: How Excalibur and Liberty could join forcesThe rise and fall of Britain's steel industryWhen asked about the proposal to cut the pension deficit, Business Minister Anna Soubry told Channel 4 News: ""We have always said we would do everything we can to look at pensions. ""The prime minister said 'no stone to be unturned' and that is exactly what has been done.""Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones told the programme that there were better ways of dealing with the scheme than putting it in the Pensions Protection Fund, which would take on the deficit, but would also result in members losing some of their benefits.""The UK government has more levers it can pull than we can with its control of the tax system and pensions legislation,"" he said.Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Mr Jones visited Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata executives.It was thought the company might announce a shortlist of bidders, but Tata would only say that bids were still under ""active consideration"".Are you a steelworker?

The biggest single donation was £850,000 from International Motors Ltd. The various campaigns for the UK to remain in the EU collectively declared £1,573,402 over the same period, the bulk of which was raised by Britain Stronger In Europe.Its largest donations were both for £250,000, one from the Bet365 group and one from Mark Coombs.The group said it had received an ""excellent response from across the UK"", with more than 13,000 donations of £50 or less.But it said the difference in amounts raised ""highlights the hypocrisy of the deep-pocketed Leave campaigns and their claims about 'the establishment', which will ring increasingly hollow as it becomes apparent how well-funded they are"".Vote Leave has said it is in a ""David and Goliath"" fight against the Remain camp - pointing to banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have funded the campaign. It has also accused Ryanair of breaking electoral law in its pro-EU campaign.On Thursday, a spokesman for Vote Leave said the Remain campaign could ""still rely on the big banks to fill their coffers"" but the public were being ""turned off by a campaign to do down the British economy"".""The fact that funding is drying up for the In campaign shows that the financial support for 'Project Fear' is collapsing,"" the Vote Leave spokesman said."

The airline dubbed the campaign ""Leave loonies"".The UK votes on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.Chancellor George Osborne, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Liberal Democrat Sir Vince Cable gave speeches making the case for remaining in the EU in front of a sign-written aircraft at Ryanair's base at Stansted Airport.It has been reported that Ryanair intends to spend €25,000 (£18,980) on a campaign for Remain. It has offered discounted flights to passengers who want to fly home to vote to stay in the EU.The airline may be able to disregard the spending rules as it is registered as a company in Ireland. A Ryanair spokesman told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: ""The Leave campaign must be getting really desperate if they're objecting to low-fare air travel for British citizens.""With less than four weeks to go, we will continue to work hard to help deliver a resounding Remain majority on 23 June - and ensure that the Leave loonies don't ban low-fare air travel too.""An Electoral Commission spokesman said it had ""received a complaint from Vote Leave regarding the campaigning activity of Ryanair at the EU referendum"".It added: ""We are establishing the facts before determining what, if any, further steps to take.""Earlier in May, Vote Leave reported Ryanair to the Metropolitan Police accusing it of bribery for offering discounted flights home to Remain voters - a suggestion rejected by Ryanair, which announced it would extend its offer.A series of major companies have given the Remain campaign their public backing but only the recruitment firm Adecco, a TV documentary producer and an advertising firm are registered campaigners so far.Adecco said it had registered because it had sponsored a single panel event with a think tank."

2016-05-25,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-25,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-25,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."

The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be. As PR strategy consultant Deborah Mattinson says: ""Social media campaigns need to be totally spot on or it's absolutely awful.""Compiled by Zak Brophy"

Lang is not so much a thinly veiled portrait of Tony Blair as an explicitly, obviously exotic extension, with added warts and delusions, of our former prime minister.Now, according to one Sunday newspaper, the Chilcot inquiry could, in reality, accuse Tony Bair of such crimes. The added spice is that while Lang merely faced his former foreign secretary, current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would apparently back Blair's prosecution at the Hague. No novelist would be quite so obvious as to cast his revenging fury as a current party leader, the very embodiment of all his victim had exiled from mainstream politics. The Ghost indeed.The Labour Party is still haunted by the manifest success and equally spectacular failure of Tony Blair. Mr Blair has just suggested that simple lessons should be learnt about genies and bottles, saying: ""We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and that would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime.""Chilcot may not be as dramatic as the weekend headlines suggest, but it is still very far from ancient history. What is the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war for?Iraq Inquiry: Timeline of key momentsThe legacy of the Iraq War is a critical part of the vital, current debate within the Labour party. Still, Mr Blair looms too large for his erstwhile supporters to either praise him or bury him. Crucially, the road to Baghdad was paved with political ambitions for his party.One was dealing with the outsized fear, after 9/11, of enemies getting hold of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The mingling of realistic fears, the actual facts and convenient fantasy is what Chilcot has to disentangle, and there will be plenty of time to chew over the findings.What may get lost is the wider context of Mr Blair's enthusiasm for action.Central to Mr Blair's transformation of the Labour Party was killing off negative perceptions that the party was ""too left wing"" for power. He didn't bother to dispute the accusations of a hostile press and the worries of swing voters - instead his technique was to flamboyantly adopt policies that spoke loudly of their opposite. In one area, he saw a double lock on Labour's door to power - the claims it was:Both had deep roots, from the pacifism of party leader George Lansbury in the 1930s to protests over Vietnam in the 1960s.But more important was CND in the 1980s and a view of the world that saw the US not as a valiant bulwark in a Cold War against tyranny, but the inheritor of an Western imperial legacy, giving succour to dictators and oppressors who made the world safe to sell Coca-Cola. Jeremy Corbyn was firmly, prominently, consistently one of those who saw the ills of the world through the lens of American imperial power. Mr Blair thought the world needed that power, almost irrespective of its actual actions.Curious as it seems in retrospect, he feared that George W Bush (pre-9/11) would disengage the US from the world. An enthusiastic ""liberal interventionist"", as set out in his Chicago speech, Tony Blair realised the US was an essential part of his vision of a West that righted wrongs with enthusiasm and military power. As he has made clear since, he didn't just go along with President Bush.""It's worse than you think,"" he said. ""I believe in it. I am truly committed to dealing with this, irrespective of the position of America.""If the Americans were not doing this, I would be pressing for them to be doing so."" He is still at it, urging a new ground war in Syria and Iraq, involving the UK, US and France.Born: 6 May 1953Educated: Choristers school, Fettes, OxfordFamily: Married, four children1976: Barrister specialising in trade union and employment law1983: Labour MP for Sedgefield, shadow City spokesman1984-87: Shadow trade and industry minister1987-88: Shadow energy secretary1989-92: Shadow employment secretary1992-94: Shadow home secretary1994-97: Opposition leader1997-2007: Prime minister, winning three successive general elections2007-2015: Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East2008: Launched the Tony Blair Faith FoundationAfter Mr Blair, after Iraq Labour supporters could bitterly, wryly, reflect that their party had put to bed forever the idea that it was weak on defence, such was his enthusiasm for offensive action. Except that is no longer true. We are witnessing the same old debates, the same old questions, about Trident, about Nato, about military spending. And perhaps that is appropriate. But it is not very helpful for the Labour party itself to be squabbling in the past tense.On the eve of the Iraq War, I reflected that we were sailing into uncharted waters - a British prime minister taking a country into a war, that as far as one can tell, the population didn't want. A war against the will of the people. It could have turned out differently, perhaps. But no WMD were found, and the occupation was both occasionally brutal and usually incompetent. New Labour staggered on, but those who had always mistrusted Mr Blair found a fitting locus for their dislike.Party members and voters peeled off, so slowly, but so certainly.His behaviour out of office has made him even more of a hate figure for some on the left. Although he is the ghost who haunts the party's halls, he is a very bouncy, upbeat, jet-setting sort of spirit - defiantly unapologetic, made extravagantly rich in part, some say, by consorting with questionable regimes. I can't be the only one who sees something of Mr Blair in Hugh Laurie's brilliant portrayal of Richard Roper in the Night Manager - not that anyone's suggesting Mr Blair is a corrupt arms dealer, its just there's something familiar about his breezy, easy way with power, wealth and entourage.Wherever Mr Corbyn's subsequent career takes him, it is impossible to imagine him following these footsteps. It is only one of the myriad ways in which he is the austere anti-Blair. Not, however, Mr Blair's exorcist, but his primal antithesis, all the tribe's most atavistic instincts reanimated, all that Mr Blair buried, resurrected.  He will not lay the family ghost.The leadership may despise Mr Blair's techniques for winning power - but they haven't yet found their own.Part of Mr Blair's skill was in the much-mocked art of triangulation, rising above left and right, to hover somewhere not only midway between the two, but with a certain degree of moral altitude above both. No-one in the Labour party has yet attempted this between Mr Blair and Mr Corbyn. It is perhaps too soon. But the world does not wait. The lessons drawn from Iraq by a former senior civil servant may be clear by the late summer, but the foreign policy debate generally grows ever more complex.It is too early for Labour to deal with its devils, but it will probably means it will be stuck in a black-and-white debate in an increasingly multi-hued world."
2016-05-25,Nick Robinson,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378655,"A pinch of cardamom, a little coriander and a smattering of cinnamon - all ingredients not just in a great British curry but in a political row that's been bubbling up in the kitchens of Indian restaurants up and down the country. It begins with a question - where is the next generation of curry chefs going to come from - and ends in with another - would leaving the EU save your local Indian from closing? Currently two or three curry restaurants are shutting every week. Now, you may think you know the answer to where Indian chefs come from. If so think again. For decades your ""Indian"" - whether a chicken tikka masala or late night vindaloo - was almost certainly cooked by a chef from Bangladesh or, perhaps, someone whose father was.  Not any more though. The voices you hear in a growing number of kitchens above the noise of the chopping and the sizzling are the voices of East Europeans - in particular Romanians. The reason is that tougher immigration rules mean it simply costs too much for most restaurants to bring new chefs over here. White thug poster aimed at ethnic minority votersPolls reveal divided nationEthnic minorities could be key, says UKIPA decade or so ago a curry chef would earn around £15,000 a year. Now, a restaurant has to pay almost double that as well as jumping a series of complex bureaucratic hurdles to persuade the Home Office to allow them to bring in a chef from abroad. ""Abroad"" means, of course, not from outside the UK but outside the EU.Pasha Khandakar, the president of the Bangladesh Caterers Association, told me that this was an ""immigration double standard"".""We've been told by British ministers to import European Union people,"" he said, pointing to a ""language problem, a culture problem and a smell problem."" He contends that Eastern European workers dislike the smell of curries. ""We have to give chance for everyone in this world who's fit for these jobs - not for their colour, not for their geographical identity.""""Why should it be easier and cheaper to hire a Romanian to work in a curry house than a Bangladeshi?"" many British Asians ask. Why, indeed, should it be so easy for Eastern Europeans to bring their families to live with them when it is now so much harder than it once was for the families of British people with Commonwealth roots to do the same? It is the widespread feeling that immigration rules now discriminate against them and their families which Brexit campaigners have sought to tap into. Indeed, the employment minister and prominent Leave campaigner, Priti Patel, has claimed that a vote to quit the EU is the only way to save the curry industry.That depends on a very big assumption. That following Brexit the British public would become so relaxed about immigration that politicians felt able to relax the immigration rules that stop low paid and low skilled workers coming here from elsewhere. At Le Raj in Epsom - an upmarket restaurant in Surrey which is a favourite of Chris Tarrant and Heston Blumenthal - that's not how they see things. The head chef here is a Bangladeshi. Recently he's had to brush up on his language skills - to learn not English but Romanian. His kitchen is manned now by people who had never smelt a curry never mind cooked one before coming to work under his tutelage. The boss of the Raj, Jeffrey Ali, is as frustrated as anyone in his industry with the current immigration rules but he tells me that he simply does not believe any politician will want ""to touch relaxing the rules with a 10 foot pole"". ""If immigration were to be brought down, even by half, there would still be no onus from any politician to say, 'Ok now because we have less people coming from the EU, let's bring in more people from the Commonwealth,'"" said Mr Ali, who plans to vote Remain in the referendum. Not least when unemployment is high amongst the British Bangladeshi community whose children choose, he argues, to claim benefit rather than to take the relatively low pay and long hours that their parents once worked as waiters or chefs. Brexit, he believes, offers a false dawn for an industry that needs to do more to raise its status and to train the next generation of chefs. Jeffrey Ali is helping to sponsor a new academy down the road to teach cooking to young British born people in the hope that one day he will not be forced to choose between immigrants he cannot afford and those who know as much about curry as he knows about Romanian cuisine.Immigration is the main reason people who plan to Vote Leave give for their choice. What's clear, though, is that even if we do vote to quit the EU on the 23rd June the debate about how much immigration we need and want and can afford as a country will stay firmly on the menu alongside  the question - who will cook and serve my Indian in the future?"
2016-05-25,The Great Escape?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382206,"Welcome aboard the top deck of an open top Daimler Fleet Line double decker.A jalopy of such vintage, I'm told, Torvill and Dean used it for a victory parade in Nottingham in 1984. And it was in its second decade then.In an era of airtight political choreography, this is a campaign that's sufficiently breezy that the party leader shouts ""duck"" on the upper deck as we all get whacked by branches when the bus goes under some trees.Think what you like about the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but two things from this vantage point seem indisputable. This referendum is happening because of the impact he's had on British politics.And who else at Westminster is up for the kind of campaigning he does?Arriving in Chapeltown, just north of Sheffield, the loudspeakers gaffer taped onto the upper deck are turned on. Eager members of the small Team Farage are instructed to cling on to said speakers, such is the fear that gravity might triumph over them.The music to The Great Escape pumps out, to a Farage chuckle; a joke the veteran MEP can't resist. The response as the bus slows is binary: from the Anglo Saxon unbroadcastable insult, hollered with gusto, to the thumbs up and smile from the nonagenarian woman at the bus stop.Pulling up outside the Wagon and Horses, Mr Farage is the unlikely voice of temporary prohibition. It's just gone 10am and he had been after a coffee; some of his activists were necking lager half an hour earlier.He leaps off the bus and starts chatting. Sure, these affairs attract the converted, the committed, the convinced. Even the evangelical.Bits of slogan-emblazoned cardboard aloft, some approach him as if Bono or Bieber have rolled up. Kisses, autographs, all the rest of it.But he has a crack too at passers by, the unconvinced, the unconverted, but persuadable. And one or two who have no intention of being persuaded at all. Mr Farage appears to be attempting to take on the crater-sized criticism screamed at him by his opponents also wanting the UK to vote to leave the EU.Their critique is simple: he can motivate those who agree with him, but he's toxic amongst those who don't, and don't yet. The big question is this: given his binary appeal, are they right? His argument is this: look how many people I've won over so far.They argue this is a race to get half of those who vote, plus one more. Can he convince those crucial floating voters?Lunch, as you might have guessed, is at a pub. High on Saddleworth Moor, the Rams Head flies a St George's flag in the car park.His persuading and charming, arguing and chatting, continues with whoever he meets. By two o'clock we are back on the vintage bus.Whatever you do, don't ask for the wifi code or where the toilet is. A corkscrew appears. Briefly entertaining the idea that, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang like, it might be to get the charabanc going again, I ask what it's for.The Rioja appears. After all, we are half an hour down the M62 away from the next campaign stop in Bolton. So let's be clear: you might have noticed this was an entertaining, engaging and refreshing day on the campaign trail. Refreshing, indeed, in all sorts of ways. But here are the big questions: Does Nigel Farage change minds among the unconvinced to win a referendum? Or do too many people simply not like him?It's a massive unanswered question. Can an approach to politics - as different as his is - actually lead it to the very highest success?Can a man who has turbo charged an outfit from a dusty room in the London School of Economics into a major player in British politics, actually achieve the only thing he ever set out to do - get the UK out of the EU?And, afterwards, whether win or lose, what on earth does he do next?"

2016-05-25,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-26,Scots vote 'within two years of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36393483,"Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has said he would expect another referendum on Scottish independence within two years of a Brexit vote, in a BBC EU debate.He said if Scotland is ""dragged out"" of the EU ""against our will"" on 23 June, he believed there would be another vote - and it would back independence. But Conservative Liam Fox said the EU vote should not be ""stoked by fear"" of a second Scottish referendum.Voters aged 18-to-29 took part in the BBC debate in Glasgow.Ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, the at-times feisty debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - also included Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU, and UKIP's Diane James, who is campaigning for a Leave vote.Former First Minister Mr Salmond, who backs remaining in the EU, told the audience a second Scottish independence referendum ""would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw"" from the EU, should it vote to leave.He said: ""If you had the situation where Scotland, in four weeks' time, votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.""""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""But Leave supporter Mr Fox accused Mr Salmond of ""yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum"".Mr Fox said: ""I have never been very sure what the SNP didn't understand about the result - the Scottish people voted to stay in the UK.""He said the EU referendum was ""a decision that we take as the UK... every vote counts.""It's a decision for all the people in the UK and we should take it on the merits of the European Union debate and not be sidetracked into yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum.""BBC political correspondent Iain WatsonIt was lively. It was feisty. And that was just the audience.The BBC referendum debate gathered together 18 to 29-year-olds from all over the UK to hear four panellists, the youngest of whom - 54-year-old Liam Fox - was a quarter of a century older than the oldest member of the audience.But the most striking contribution came from 60-something Alex Salmond. The former first minister of Scotland didn't just want to talk about this referendum, but the next one.Read more from Iain.During a wide-ranging discussion, the audience criticised both campaigns for using the economy and immigration to ""get the emotions ramped up"". Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the ""scaremongering"" material put out by the Treasury on the Remain side, adding: ""It wouldn't be economic apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more chances if we stay in.""He said: ""That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose.""To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case.""Some of the young voters taking part criticised ""tit-for-tat"" attacks during the campaign, describing it as ""petty name-calling"" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been ""appalling"".She said there had been a focus on migration ""on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government.. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy"". Other issues raised during the debate included travel, the NHS, house prices and jobs. Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, Mr Fox said: ""Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after.""Why do we have these arrangements? Because it is genuinely in the interests of both parties to do so.""But Labour's Mr Johnson said: ""At the moment, we have a very beneficial system we can go anywhere within the EU, it's a two-way process...""There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are you going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas.""He added: ""Unless you put a border and watchtowers across the borders between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, you're going to have people coming across there because you're going to have an EU country and a non-EU country."" Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, UKIP's Ms James said: ""We just don't know"".She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a ""Plan B""."

2016-05-26,G7 leaders warn of Brexit risk to growth,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394905,"A declaration at the G7 meeting in Japan says a vote by the UK to leave the European Union would pose a ""serious threat to global growth"".In its final statement, the group warned that a UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend of increased global trade, investment and jobs. The meeting brings together the world's leading seven industrialised nations. The final communiqué set global growth as a priority for dealing with threats to the world's economy and security.But the warning about the economic consequences of the UK leaving the European Union comes as Britain prepares for a referendum on 23 June. Prime Minister David Cameron has been campaigning for Britain to stay within the 28-country bloc with recent polls suggesting a lead for those who support remaining within the EU. The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideAnalysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondentThat Brexit has been seen as a serious risk to the world economy at the G7 shouldn't surprise anyone. The G7 finance ministers meeting over the weekend in Sendai came to the same conclusion - and it was what the Japanese Central Bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told me in an interview earlier this week. What is surprising is how much of an impact this communique says a yes vote will have on global growth - jobs, investment and trade will be affected. But it's also sentiment - investors are nervous about what Brexit will mean for confidence in Europe and how it will change the landscape of the world economy. No one likes uncertainty, and with 26 days left before the referendum, expect a lot more of these sorts of global statements.After two days of talks, the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan set global growth as an ""urgent priority.""The group pledged to ""collectively tackle"" major risks to global growth, including threats to the international order from terrorist attacks and violent extremism.The statement promised to commit ""to strengthening... policy responses in a cooperative manner and to employing a more forceful and balanced policy mix, in order to swiftly achieve a strong, sustainable and balanced growth pattern"".""We remain committed to ensuring that growth is inclusive and job-rich, benefiting all segments of our societies,"" the document added. They also called for international markets to be kept open to fight all forms of protectionism and for countries to avoid competitive devaluations of their currencies.The G7 has also released an action plan to counter terrorism which they hope will close ""critical gaps"" in capacity and international cooperation. Aside from stepping up information sharing between countries and Interpol, they also said they would improve border control and aviation security. The communiqué described the migrant crisis in Europe ""as a global challenge which requires a global response"" of increased aid from international financial institutions and donor countries.The statement went on to express ""concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas"" where maritime disputes have lead to increasing regional tensions over the past years.  While there is no mention of China and its expansion into territorially disputed waters specifically, the document calls for respecting freedom of navigation and for resolving conflicts peacefully through law."
2016-05-26,UK set to send second warship to Libya,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394597,"The UK is set to send another warship to the Mediterranean to help tackle people-smuggling and movements of arms in and out of Libya, officials say.David Cameron told the G7 summit in Japan that the UK was ready to take an ""active leadership role"" in helping Libya deal with trafficking. The UK currently has one survey vessel, HMS Enterprise, operating in the area.For the UK to send another warship, the EU will need to extend the mandate of its current naval operation.UK officials at this week's meeting of G7 industrialised nations said they would seek UN approval so that the new warship could also seize boats suspected of smuggling arms to fighters of so-called Islamic State in Libya. Last Sunday the new Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli asked the European Union for more help in training its navy and coastguard to stop the trafficking of migrants across the Mediterranean.It is thought this may soon be followed by a request for international ships to operate in Libyan waters.If this request is received, the UK will seek the extension of the EU's Operation Sophia mission to tackle people-trafficking in the central Mediterranean, as well as a Security Council resolution at the UN enabling its forces to assist in the interception of arms shipments.This week the UK sent four military planners to the Rome headquarters of Operation Sophia, with the goal of preparing a plan to improve the effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard.Downing Street did not say what type of Royal Navy ship would be sent and declined to discuss what evidence it had for illicit arms movements from the Libyan coast.Mr Cameron first put forward the idea of extending Operation Sophia into Libyan territorial waters at a Brussels summit of the EU in March.He warned that the number of migrants attempting to cross via the central Mediterranean could be expected to swell once the alternative route through Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans had been closed."
2016-05-26,Hundreds more terror records deleted,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394494,"Errors that led to fingerprint and DNA records of hundreds of terror suspects being deleted were more widespread than thought, it has emerged. The Biometrics Commissioner said two months ago that 450 profiles had been wrongly deleted from a police database in England and Wales. But in an updated report, Alastair MacGregor revealed the figure was 810. The Home Office, which released the report, said steps were being taken to fix the issue. Under a new system introduced in 2013, DNA and fingerprint profiles of people who are not convicted of a crime have to be removed from a counter-terrorism database. However, the records can be kept in the interests of national security - such as in cases where someone has been suspected of having links to terrorism - when a senior officer makes a national security determination (NSD).But Mr MacGregor said the 810 profiles had been deleted because police officers had failed to make NSD applications in time.He found that in at least 108 cases there would have been national security grounds to store the data and the records ""could and should have been retained"".He added: ""It is obviously very important that steps quickly be taken to establish whether - and, if so, how - replacement material should be obtained from those individuals and/or other action should be taken to minimise any risk which they pose to national security.""Mr MacGregor also revised upwards the number of people on British counter-terrorism databases who have not been convicted of a ""recordable"" offence, from 3,800 to 4,500.However, he said he was ""broadly satisfied"" that the issues he raised were being addressed.A Home Office spokesman said: ""The commissioner has concluded that steps are being taken to address these issues, and the police have provided further assurances that they will be kept under close review.""The government's full response to the commissioner's annual report will be published in due course.""Source: Biometrics Commissioner's annual report, 2015, and Home Office and National DNA database annual report"
2016-05-26,Treasury warns of 'Brexit pension hit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36393513,"The Treasury has warned that millions of current and future pensioners will be worse off if the UK leaves the European Union.Its analysis suggests Brexit would cause inflation to rise, eroding the value of state pension increases, costing recipients £137 a year.Those with an additional pension pot worth £60,000 would see its value drop by £1,900, the Treasury said.However, Vote Leave said the analysis was ""utterly outrageous"".Former Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for Vote Leave, said: ""This is an utterly outrageous attempt by the government to do down people's pensions and is little more than a cynical attempt to distract from the government's broken promises on immigration.""""The biggest threat to British pensions is the European Commission's proposals to undermine occupational pensions, which the government themselves have described as 'damaging and reckless'.""Meanwhile, tax proposals from Eurozone countries will wipe billions off British assets hitting pension funds hardest,"" he said.The Treasury analysis also looked at the impact Brexit would have on someone aged 50.Its analysis found that an individual with pension savings of £20,000, who is contributing 8% of their earnings into a pension fund between now and 2030, would be between £223 and £335 a year worse off in retirement.Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Much of the [Brexit] debate so far has focused on the potential economic fallout of a vote for Leave for those now in work, in terms of the impact on their jobs. ""But it's important that pensioners understand what's at stake for them too on 23 June.""Pensioners who have worked hard all their lives deserve dignity, security and certainty in retirement. That's what we all hope for and what any responsible government should seek to provide,"" the Chancellor said.Pensions minister Baroness Altmann, told the BBC's Today programme, that there was a ""consensus"" among major economic bodies such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the OECD, the head of the IMF and the Bank of England  that the British economy would be weaker if there was a vote to leave the EU.""I have looked at pensions for years. If there is uncertainty, markets do not do well. If there is economic weakness companies cannot do well and that means your investments in pensions and the amount of money put in pensions will fall,"" she added.Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy, Hargreaves Lansdown said such forecasting was ""ambitious"".""The Treasury paints a fairly apocalyptic picture of widespread reductions in retirement incomes. ""The key assumptions they make are of higher inflation and lower economic growth; both of these assumptions may be open to challenge by the Leave campaign. ""Change the underlying assumptions and you change the outcomes."" The state pension has been subjected to a triple lock since 2010, ensuring it rises each year by whichever is higher - inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.He said at the moment state pensioners were receiving annual increases above the rate of inflation.Higher prices would erode this benefit, but because state pension increases are pegged to inflation their standard of living would be maintained.Mr McPhail said higher prices are likely to be more of a problem for some final salary pensions and many individual annuities that are not fully inflation-proofed.""Higher inflation could therefore undermine the real value of these incomes.""However we also note that a rise in bond yields following a Leave vote could equally have a significant beneficial impact on final salary scheme deficits.""He said a recent survey by fund managers conducted by Hargreaves Lansdown on the impact of Brexit, found the majority agreed it would mean lower GDP over 1 to 2 years, but more than a fifth suggested it could be higher in 5-10 years. In the longer term they forecast Brexit would have no impact on the economy."
2016-05-26,"Net migration to UK rises to 333,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382199,"Net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates - the second highest figure on record.Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high.Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been ""cynical"" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK was part of the EU.Speaking to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Conservative MP and former London Mayor said it was ""cynical and unacceptable to say you can fulfil that pledge"".""I think that they (the figures) show the scandal of the promise made by politicians repeatedly that they could cut immigration to the tens of thousands and then to throw their hands up in the air and say there's nothing we can do because Brussels has taken away our control of immigration,"" he said.Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU in June's referendum, said he was pro-immigration but there was ""no public consent for the scale of immigration we are seeing"" and the situation was ""completely out of control"".He said that the only solution was to leave the EU, saying that a vote to stay in the union would mean people ""kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration"".Laura Kuenssberg said the immigration figures ""could hardly have come at a more sensitive time, just when the referendum campaign is moving into a more brutal and frantic phase"".Home Office minister James Brokenshire said David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU, which will see restrictions placed on the benefits new arrivals can claim and a crackdown on ""sham marriages"", would ""close back-door routes"" into the country. ""Leaving the EU is absolutely no panacea or silver bullet,"" he added, telling BBC News that net migration from outside the EU was higher than from within it and leaving would ""wreck the economy and harm jobs"". In other developments, with four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June on whether to stay in or leave the EU:According to the Office for National Statistics, there was a 20,000 rise in net migration to the UK from the 313,000 for the year to December 2014.The figure is well above the government's aim of getting it to the ""tens of thousands"" and is the highest recorded for a calendar year.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.A Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether Mr Cameron remained committed to that target but said the government would ""continue to look at what more might be done"".The spokesman added: ""Of course people rightly have concerns on immigration but the PM's view is very clearly that wrecking the economy and destroying jobs by getting rid of our privileged access to the world's biggest market is not the answer.""He said the Leave campaign failed to spell out what would happen to migration if the UK left the EU, with some saying ""they will cut migration while telling other groups that they will keep freedom of movement or increase visas"".Thursday's figures show estimated levels of long-term migration into the UK from within the EU and outside in the year to December 2015.They show that 270,000 EU citizens moved to the UK for at least a year in 2015, up from 264,000 in 2014. The number of non-EU citizens moving to the UK was 277,000, down from 287,000 in 2014.The rise in the net figure was the result of a fall in the numbers of people emigrating.Analysis By Home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe net migration figure is just short of the record but that statistic alone doesn't do justice to the global picture and the UK's place in it. Everywhere you look, people are on the move - coming and going depending on economic and political circumstances. EU immigration is relatively stable - although there are more southern Europeans than before thanks to the Eurozone's economic doldrums. One really interesting figure, that doesn't affect the population headcount - officially at least - is the 110,000 rise in short-term immigration to about 1.2m. More people are coming for less than a year - such as short contract workers selected by employers who are looking internationally for the best people at the most competitive price. But it will also include some Brits who spend part of the year here - and the rest living in the sun. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the numbers show ""mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU, going on with disastrous open borders"".But former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett warned that an agreement with France to allow British border controls at Calais and the Eurostar terminals in Paris and Brussels would be at risk if Britain left the EU. He criticised Leave campaigners for wanting to create a ""fortress Britain"" - and defended the last Labour government's record immigration, saying ""We didn't just simply say to Poles coming in back in 2004, just come here, we said we'd rather you come here and work than be in the sub-economy."" He added: ""40% of those who registered to work back in 2004 were already in the country and the reason I make that point is because a lot of people would come in illegally if we didn't have the border controls on French soil.""  The Institute of Directors said the public was ""being very poorly served by the current level of the debate on immigration"" and people came to work in the UK because it is one of ""best performing economies in Europe"".""Employment is at a record high, and there are big skills gaps that employers cannot fill domestically. Despite the overblown rhetoric that today's figures have sparked, the actual numbers have not changed much in the last year,"" said IoD employment spokesman Seamus Nevin.Other ONS figures on employment show:How to follow the BBC One EU referendum debate"
2016-05-26,French unions oppose Hinkley Point,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394601,"The future of the planned new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point remains in doubt as key French unions still oppose the project, BBC Newsnight has learned. EDF, which would build the plant, had delayed a decision on the project in Somerset until the summer while it consulted French union representatives.The company, which is 85% French state-owned, had hoped to win support from a committee of workplace representatives. But the committee said staff had not been reassured about the plant's costs.Trade union representatives hold six of the 18 seats on EDF's board.Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of the Central Works Committee that EDF consulted with, told Newsnight that staff feared the cost of the project would cripple EDF.He said: ""We have reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation, and procurement.""The trade unions are unlikely to give their blessing to the project in its current state. All you need to know about Hinkley Point""We are not reassured by the documents we have received. We have been given a marketing folder, not the full information we require.""We got the documents on 9 May - we are sending EDF a request for more explanations.""On Monday French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron wrote to MPs on Westminster's energy select committee to reassure them the French government remained committed to the project.But Mr Macron added: ""It is also necessary, in the interests of all, that EDF follows due process before committing itself to an investment of this magnitude. ""The consultation of the Central Works Committee brings legal robustness on the decision.""EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz also told MPs on the committee that he did not know when a final decision on the project would be made.Earlier this month, French President Francois Hollande said he would like the project to go ahead.Hinkley Point C, which would provide 7% of the UK's total energy requirements, had originally been meant to open in 2017. But it has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project.While one third of the £18bn capital costs of the project are being met by Chinese investors, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company.In March, Thomas Piquemal, EDF's chief financial officer, quit after his proposal to delay the project by three years was rejected by colleagues.In April, French Energy Minister Ségolène Royale also suggested the project should be delayed.Much of this scepticism is the consequence of problems in constructing nuclear power stations to similar designs elsewhere. A plant being built by EDF at Flamanville in Normandy, northern France, has been hit by years of delays and spiralling costs. Furthermore, since the company is nationally owned, the decision is also subject to political pressure. A former energy adviser to the French government told Newsnight that while EDF did not technically need the backing of the trade union representatives, it would be very difficult, politically, to go ahead without it.Yves Marignac said: ""Going for it would for the government be crossing a red line in their relationship with the trade unions, which would make it really difficult for the government, particularly with the perspective of the next general election when they will need to get some support of the trade unions.""Making a decision for the project is not possible right now. The political costs and the costs for EDF's financial situation are too high right now."""

2016-05-26,Procurement costs 'slashed outside EU',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382197,"""Foolish"" EU procurement rules cost UK taxpayers £1.6bn a year, which could be better spent on new hospitals and flood defences, Leave campaigners have said.Existing laws imposed a big bureaucratic burden on companies, Vote Leave said, with no regard to the size of contracts or who was tendering.An estimated 1.9 million days were lost a year in red-tape delays, it added.But Remain campaigners said their opponents' wider economic arguments were ""falling apart"".Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the Leave team were ""becoming increasingly desperate"" and claimed the figures cited showed that Norway and Iceland, which are outside the EU, faced higher procurement costs than the UK. The British public will decide whether to vote to stay in the EU or leave in a referendum on 23 June.In other developments:On Wednesday the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the budgetary gains from leaving the EU could be outweighed by the subsequent economic damage while the head of the World Trade Organization said the UK could face £9bn in import tariffs outside the EU. As it seeks to turn the spotlight on the risks of remaining in the EU, Vote Leave has published new research it says shows the extent to which EU procurement processes are harming business competitiveness.Procurement laws, it says, are an integral part of the EU's internal market, from which it wants to withdraw. The threshold at which procurement legislation applies is set too low, it says, inhibiting businesses from bidding for contracts above that level, while the rules cover purely domestic tenders, including the bulk of government contracts, unrelated to foreign trade.The government, Vote Leave says, promised to alleviate the burden on private companies and public authorities of complying with the ""onerous"" rules - including the requirement to advertise all major tenders in EU publications and to read a 128-page code of contract regulations - but it did not feature in Mr Cameron's renegotiations of the UK's membership.How to follow BBC One's EU Referendum debateVote Leave says complying with EU rules has cost the British taxpayer £1.7bn in each of the past five years, funds which it says would pay for 25 new hospitals, 273,000 basic state pensions as well as increased spending on NHS drugs and road maintenance.It arrived at the figure of £8.4bn over five years by multiplying the amount spent by government on current and capital procurement every year and multiplying that by the estimated cost of EU compliance, taking into account inflation. Separate analysis suggests two million days have been lost in each of the past five years because of delays in finalising contracts. Vote Leave has cited a European Commission report in 2011 suggesting UK contracts took 193 days on average to progress from tender to award, longer than any other EU member apart from Greece and Malta. Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a leading Leave campaigner, has previously said EU procurement rules constrained government efforts to build new schools and refurbish existing ones when he was education secretary. Speaking on Thursday, he said: ""If we vote Leave, we can scrap the EU's foolish rules on how Whitehall runs procurement processes, which add billions to the cost of government every year,"" he said.""I've experienced firsthand in the Department for Education how these rules add significant operational costs and generate expensive delays to construction projects. ""Across Whitehall, there are billions to save after we vote Leave.""But the Leave campaign has been accused of overstating the amount that would be saved by leaving the single market and circumventing existing EU regulation.

2016-05-26,Warning over steel pension cut proposal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36384508,"The government has been warned that a plan to cut pension benefits to help save Tata Steel's UK operations could take ministers down a ""dangerous path"".Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb urged caution over ""rushed changes"" he said could have implications for workers ""well beyond the steel industry"".A £485m pension deficit has been deterring potential buyers of Tata.Ministers are considering changing the measure used for British Steel pension increases to cut its liabilities. The government is expected to propose basing the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the current Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure.Some union leaders are likely to support the proposals, the BBC understands.But Mark Turner of the Unite union cautioned that he wanted to see the detail.""We don't want to make changes if they're going to be detrimental to the rest of industry,"" he told the BBC.In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members; it is not clear how many of those would be affected by the plan.Further details are likely to emerge later when the government announces a consultation on the proposals in a written statement to the House of Commons.Former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: ""The government is going down a very dangerous path.""Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry.""The suggestion is that the new rules would stipulate that a company could only change their pension liabilities in an emergency. But, speaking to the BBC, Mr Webb said the term emergency was ""ill-defined"" and that companies could create them artificially in order to reduce their pension payouts.""Once there's a loophole that says you can walk away from promises you've made. Other [companies] could walk away,"" he said, adding that he thought there could also be legal challenges.Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said steel workers' pensions ""must be protected"".""If these reports are accurate, the secretary of state for work and pensions should come to the House to explain precisely what is being proposed, including how current and future steel pensioners will be affected and what precedents might be set by any changes to hard-won pension protection legislation,"" he added. The pension fund and its deficit have been a source of unease for the current owners Tata and a deal-breaker for any would-be buyers.Reducing its burden will make a sale easier and may even convince Tata to hang on to its UK steel business. Any such change would be very controversial as it would set what some would see as a dangerous precedent.The move is evidence of the business secretary's sense of urgency to resolve an industrial crisis which has put 10,000 steel workers' jobs in imminent danger. The BBC understands that union leaders have accepted that this proposal is a better deal than seeing the pension scheme shunted into the lifeboat of the Pensions Protection Fund, which can see some members lose 10% of their payout immediately and see lower increments in future years.  Who are the potential bidders?Jack: How Excalibur and Liberty could join forcesThe rise and fall of Britain's steel industryWhen asked about the proposal to cut the pension deficit, Business Minister Anna Soubry told Channel 4 News: ""We have always said we would do everything we can to look at pensions. ""The prime minister said 'no stone to be unturned' and that is exactly what has been done.""Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones told the programme that there were better ways of dealing with the scheme than putting it in the Pensions Protection Fund, which would take on the deficit, but would also result in members losing some of their benefits.""The UK government has more levers it can pull than we can with its control of the tax system and pensions legislation,"" he said.Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Mr Jones visited Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata executives.It was thought the company might announce a shortlist of bidders, but Tata would only say that bids were still under ""active consideration"".Are you a steelworker?

The biggest single donation was £850,000 from International Motors Ltd. The various campaigns for the UK to remain in the EU collectively declared £1,573,402 over the same period, the bulk of which was raised by Britain Stronger In Europe.Its largest donations were both for £250,000, one from the Bet365 group and one from Mark Coombs.The group said it had received an ""excellent response from across the UK"", with more than 13,000 donations of £50 or less.But it said the difference in amounts raised ""highlights the hypocrisy of the deep-pocketed Leave campaigns and their claims about 'the establishment', which will ring increasingly hollow as it becomes apparent how well-funded they are"".Vote Leave has said it is in a ""David and Goliath"" fight against the Remain camp - pointing to banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have funded the campaign. It has also accused Ryanair of breaking electoral law in its pro-EU campaign.On Thursday, a spokesman for Vote Leave said the Remain campaign could ""still rely on the big banks to fill their coffers"" but the public were being ""turned off by a campaign to do down the British economy"".""The fact that funding is drying up for the In campaign shows that the financial support for 'Project Fear' is collapsing,"" the Vote Leave spokesman said."

The airline dubbed the campaign ""Leave loonies"".The UK votes on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.Chancellor George Osborne, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Liberal Democrat Sir Vince Cable gave speeches making the case for remaining in the EU in front of a sign-written aircraft at Ryanair's base at Stansted Airport.It has been reported that Ryanair intends to spend €25,000 (£18,980) on a campaign for Remain. It has offered discounted flights to passengers who want to fly home to vote to stay in the EU.The airline may be able to disregard the spending rules as it is registered as a company in Ireland. A Ryanair spokesman told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: ""The Leave campaign must be getting really desperate if they're objecting to low-fare air travel for British citizens.""With less than four weeks to go, we will continue to work hard to help deliver a resounding Remain majority on 23 June - and ensure that the Leave loonies don't ban low-fare air travel too.""An Electoral Commission spokesman said it had ""received a complaint from Vote Leave regarding the campaigning activity of Ryanair at the EU referendum"".It added: ""We are establishing the facts before determining what, if any, further steps to take.""Earlier in May, Vote Leave reported Ryanair to the Metropolitan Police accusing it of bribery for offering discounted flights home to Remain voters - a suggestion rejected by Ryanair, which announced it would extend its offer.A series of major companies have given the Remain campaign their public backing but only the recruitment firm Adecco, a TV documentary producer and an advertising firm are registered campaigners so far.Adecco said it had registered because it had sponsored a single panel event with a think tank."

2016-05-26,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-26,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-26,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."
2016-05-26,Is it 'workin'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380007,"The battle between the Remain and Leave sides in the EU referendum is in full swing and social media is being used by both camps to try to win the race.Younger voters have so far been slower to register to vote and campaigners are keen to win their attention and support.Some strategies have enjoyed surprise success while others have misfired completely. The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be. As PR strategy consultant Deborah Mattinson says: ""Social media campaigns need to be totally spot on or it's absolutely awful.""Compiled by Zak Brophy"

2016-05-26,Success and failure,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36370560,"Adam Lang, the fictional British Prime Minister in Robert Harris' novel The Ghost faces prosecution for war crimes in an international court. Lang is not so much a thinly veiled portrait of Tony Blair as an explicitly, obviously exotic extension, with added warts and delusions, of our former prime minister.Now, according to one Sunday newspaper, the Chilcot inquiry could, in reality, accuse Tony Bair of such crimes. The added spice is that while Lang merely faced his former foreign secretary, current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would apparently back Blair's prosecution at the Hague. No novelist would be quite so obvious as to cast his revenging fury as a current party leader, the very embodiment of all his victim had exiled from mainstream politics. The Ghost indeed.The Labour Party is still haunted by the manifest success and equally spectacular failure of Tony Blair. Mr Blair has just suggested that simple lessons should be learnt about genies and bottles, saying: ""We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and that would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime.""Chilcot may not be as dramatic as the weekend headlines suggest, but it is still very far from ancient history. What is the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war for?Iraq Inquiry: Timeline of key momentsThe legacy of the Iraq War is a critical part of the vital, current debate within the Labour party. Still, Mr Blair looms too large for his erstwhile supporters to either praise him or bury him. Crucially, the road to Baghdad was paved with political ambitions for his party.One was dealing with the outsized fear, after 9/11, of enemies getting hold of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The mingling of realistic fears, the actual facts and convenient fantasy is what Chilcot has to disentangle, and there will be plenty of time to chew over the findings.What may get lost is the wider context of Mr Blair's enthusiasm for action.Central to Mr Blair's transformation of the Labour Party was killing off negative perceptions that the party was ""too left wing"" for power. He didn't bother to dispute the accusations of a hostile press and the worries of swing voters - instead his technique was to flamboyantly adopt policies that spoke loudly of their opposite. In one area, he saw a double lock on Labour's door to power - the claims it was:Both had deep roots, from the pacifism of party leader George Lansbury in the 1930s to protests over Vietnam in the 1960s.But more important was CND in the 1980s and a view of the world that saw the US not as a valiant bulwark in a Cold War against tyranny, but the inheritor of an Western imperial legacy, giving succour to dictators and oppressors who made the world safe to sell Coca-Cola. Jeremy Corbyn was firmly, prominently, consistently one of those who saw the ills of the world through the lens of American imperial power. Mr Blair thought the world needed that power, almost irrespective of its actual actions.Curious as it seems in retrospect, he feared that George W Bush (pre-9/11) would disengage the US from the world. An enthusiastic ""liberal interventionist"", as set out in his Chicago speech, Tony Blair realised the US was an essential part of his vision of a West that righted wrongs with enthusiasm and military power. As he has made clear since, he didn't just go along with President Bush.""It's worse than you think,"" he said. ""I believe in it. I am truly committed to dealing with this, irrespective of the position of America.""If the Americans were not doing this, I would be pressing for them to be doing so."" He is still at it, urging a new ground war in Syria and Iraq, involving the UK, US and France.Born: 6 May 1953Educated: Choristers school, Fettes, OxfordFamily: Married, four children1976: Barrister specialising in trade union and employment law1983: Labour MP for Sedgefield, shadow City spokesman1984-87: Shadow trade and industry minister1987-88: Shadow energy secretary1989-92: Shadow employment secretary1992-94: Shadow home secretary1994-97: Opposition leader1997-2007: Prime minister, winning three successive general elections2007-2015: Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East2008: Launched the Tony Blair Faith FoundationAfter Mr Blair, after Iraq Labour supporters could bitterly, wryly, reflect that their party had put to bed forever the idea that it was weak on defence, such was his enthusiasm for offensive action. Except that is no longer true. We are witnessing the same old debates, the same old questions, about Trident, about Nato, about military spending. And perhaps that is appropriate. But it is not very helpful for the Labour party itself to be squabbling in the past tense.On the eve of the Iraq War, I reflected that we were sailing into uncharted waters - a British prime minister taking a country into a war, that as far as one can tell, the population didn't want. A war against the will of the people. It could have turned out differently, perhaps. But no WMD were found, and the occupation was both occasionally brutal and usually incompetent. New Labour staggered on, but those who had always mistrusted Mr Blair found a fitting locus for their dislike.Party members and voters peeled off, so slowly, but so certainly.His behaviour out of office has made him even more of a hate figure for some on the left. Although he is the ghost who haunts the party's halls, he is a very bouncy, upbeat, jet-setting sort of spirit - defiantly unapologetic, made extravagantly rich in part, some say, by consorting with questionable regimes. I can't be the only one who sees something of Mr Blair in Hugh Laurie's brilliant portrayal of Richard Roper in the Night Manager - not that anyone's suggesting Mr Blair is a corrupt arms dealer, its just there's something familiar about his breezy, easy way with power, wealth and entourage.Wherever Mr Corbyn's subsequent career takes him, it is impossible to imagine him following these footsteps. It is only one of the myriad ways in which he is the austere anti-Blair. Not, however, Mr Blair's exorcist, but his primal antithesis, all the tribe's most atavistic instincts reanimated, all that Mr Blair buried, resurrected.  He will not lay the family ghost.The leadership may despise Mr Blair's techniques for winning power - but they haven't yet found their own.Part of Mr Blair's skill was in the much-mocked art of triangulation, rising above left and right, to hover somewhere not only midway between the two, but with a certain degree of moral altitude above both. No-one in the Labour party has yet attempted this between Mr Blair and Mr Corbyn. It is perhaps too soon. But the world does not wait. The lessons drawn from Iraq by a former senior civil servant may be clear by the late summer, but the foreign policy debate generally grows ever more complex.It is too early for Labour to deal with its devils, but it will probably means it will be stuck in a black-and-white debate in an increasingly multi-hued world."
2016-05-26,Nick Robinson,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378655,"A pinch of cardamom, a little coriander and a smattering of cinnamon - all ingredients not just in a great British curry but in a political row that's been bubbling up in the kitchens of Indian restaurants up and down the country. It begins with a question - where is the next generation of curry chefs going to come from - and ends in with another - would leaving the EU save your local Indian from closing? Currently two or three curry restaurants are shutting every week. Now, you may think you know the answer to where Indian chefs come from. If so think again. For decades your ""Indian"" - whether a chicken tikka masala or late night vindaloo - was almost certainly cooked by a chef from Bangladesh or, perhaps, someone whose father was.  Not any more though. The voices you hear in a growing number of kitchens above the noise of the chopping and the sizzling are the voices of East Europeans - in particular Romanians. The reason is that tougher immigration rules mean it simply costs too much for most restaurants to bring new chefs over here. White thug poster aimed at ethnic minority votersPolls reveal divided nationEthnic minorities could be key, says UKIPA decade or so ago a curry chef would earn around £15,000 a year. Now, a restaurant has to pay almost double that as well as jumping a series of complex bureaucratic hurdles to persuade the Home Office to allow them to bring in a chef from abroad. ""Abroad"" means, of course, not from outside the UK but outside the EU.Pasha Khandakar, the president of the Bangladesh Caterers Association, told me that this was an ""immigration double standard"".""We've been told by British ministers to import European Union people,"" he said, pointing to a ""language problem, a culture problem and a smell problem."" He contends that Eastern European workers dislike the smell of curries. ""We have to give chance for everyone in this world who's fit for these jobs - not for their colour, not for their geographical identity.""""Why should it be easier and cheaper to hire a Romanian to work in a curry house than a Bangladeshi?"" many British Asians ask. Why, indeed, should it be so easy for Eastern Europeans to bring their families to live with them when it is now so much harder than it once was for the families of British people with Commonwealth roots to do the same? It is the widespread feeling that immigration rules now discriminate against them and their families which Brexit campaigners have sought to tap into. Indeed, the employment minister and prominent Leave campaigner, Priti Patel, has claimed that a vote to quit the EU is the only way to save the curry industry.That depends on a very big assumption. That following Brexit the British public would become so relaxed about immigration that politicians felt able to relax the immigration rules that stop low paid and low skilled workers coming here from elsewhere. At Le Raj in Epsom - an upmarket restaurant in Surrey which is a favourite of Chris Tarrant and Heston Blumenthal - that's not how they see things. The head chef here is a Bangladeshi. Recently he's had to brush up on his language skills - to learn not English but Romanian. His kitchen is manned now by people who had never smelt a curry never mind cooked one before coming to work under his tutelage. The boss of the Raj, Jeffrey Ali, is as frustrated as anyone in his industry with the current immigration rules but he tells me that he simply does not believe any politician will want ""to touch relaxing the rules with a 10 foot pole"". ""If immigration were to be brought down, even by half, there would still be no onus from any politician to say, 'Ok now because we have less people coming from the EU, let's bring in more people from the Commonwealth,'"" said Mr Ali, who plans to vote Remain in the referendum. Not least when unemployment is high amongst the British Bangladeshi community whose children choose, he argues, to claim benefit rather than to take the relatively low pay and long hours that their parents once worked as waiters or chefs. Brexit, he believes, offers a false dawn for an industry that needs to do more to raise its status and to train the next generation of chefs. Jeffrey Ali is helping to sponsor a new academy down the road to teach cooking to young British born people in the hope that one day he will not be forced to choose between immigrants he cannot afford and those who know as much about curry as he knows about Romanian cuisine.Immigration is the main reason people who plan to Vote Leave give for their choice. What's clear, though, is that even if we do vote to quit the EU on the 23rd June the debate about how much immigration we need and want and can afford as a country will stay firmly on the menu alongside  the question - who will cook and serve my Indian in the future?"
2016-05-26,The Great Escape?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382206,"Welcome aboard the top deck of an open top Daimler Fleet Line double decker.A jalopy of such vintage, I'm told, Torvill and Dean used it for a victory parade in Nottingham in 1984. And it was in its second decade then.In an era of airtight political choreography, this is a campaign that's sufficiently breezy that the party leader shouts ""duck"" on the upper deck as we all get whacked by branches when the bus goes under some trees.Think what you like about the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but two things from this vantage point seem indisputable. This referendum is happening because of the impact he's had on British politics.And who else at Westminster is up for the kind of campaigning he does?Arriving in Chapeltown, just north of Sheffield, the loudspeakers gaffer taped onto the upper deck are turned on. Eager members of the small Team Farage are instructed to cling on to said speakers, such is the fear that gravity might triumph over them.The music to The Great Escape pumps out, to a Farage chuckle; a joke the veteran MEP can't resist. The response as the bus slows is binary: from the Anglo Saxon unbroadcastable insult, hollered with gusto, to the thumbs up and smile from the nonagenarian woman at the bus stop.Pulling up outside the Wagon and Horses, Mr Farage is the unlikely voice of temporary prohibition. It's just gone 10am and he had been after a coffee; some of his activists were necking lager half an hour earlier.He leaps off the bus and starts chatting. Sure, these affairs attract the converted, the committed, the convinced. Even the evangelical.Bits of slogan-emblazoned cardboard aloft, some approach him as if Bono or Bieber have rolled up. Kisses, autographs, all the rest of it.But he has a crack too at passers by, the unconvinced, the unconverted, but persuadable. And one or two who have no intention of being persuaded at all. Mr Farage appears to be attempting to take on the crater-sized criticism screamed at him by his opponents also wanting the UK to vote to leave the EU.Their critique is simple: he can motivate those who agree with him, but he's toxic amongst those who don't, and don't yet. The big question is this: given his binary appeal, are they right? His argument is this: look how many people I've won over so far.They argue this is a race to get half of those who vote, plus one more. Can he convince those crucial floating voters?Lunch, as you might have guessed, is at a pub. High on Saddleworth Moor, the Rams Head flies a St George's flag in the car park.His persuading and charming, arguing and chatting, continues with whoever he meets. By two o'clock we are back on the vintage bus.Whatever you do, don't ask for the wifi code or where the toilet is. A corkscrew appears. Briefly entertaining the idea that, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang like, it might be to get the charabanc going again, I ask what it's for.The Rioja appears. After all, we are half an hour down the M62 away from the next campaign stop in Bolton. So let's be clear: you might have noticed this was an entertaining, engaging and refreshing day on the campaign trail. Refreshing, indeed, in all sorts of ways. But here are the big questions: Does Nigel Farage change minds among the unconvinced to win a referendum? Or do too many people simply not like him?It's a massive unanswered question. Can an approach to politics - as different as his is - actually lead it to the very highest success?Can a man who has turbo charged an outfit from a dusty room in the London School of Economics into a major player in British politics, actually achieve the only thing he ever set out to do - get the UK out of the EU?And, afterwards, whether win or lose, what on earth does he do next?"

2016-05-26,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

2016-05-27,Scots vote 'within two years of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36393483,"Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has said he would expect another referendum on Scottish independence within two years of a Brexit vote, in a BBC EU debate.He said if Scotland is ""dragged out"" of the EU ""against our will"" on 23 June, he believed there would be another vote - and it would back independence. But Conservative Liam Fox said the EU vote should not be ""stoked by fear"" of a second Scottish referendum.Voters aged 18-to-29 took part in the BBC debate in Glasgow.Ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, the at-times feisty debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - also included Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU, and UKIP's Diane James, who is campaigning for a Leave vote.Former First Minister Mr Salmond, who backs remaining in the EU, told the audience a second Scottish independence referendum ""would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw"" from the EU, should it vote to leave.He said: ""If you had the situation where Scotland, in four weeks' time, votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.""""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""But Leave supporter Mr Fox accused Mr Salmond of ""yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum"".Mr Fox said: ""I have never been very sure what the SNP didn't understand about the result - the Scottish people voted to stay in the UK.""He said the EU referendum was ""a decision that we take as the UK... every vote counts.""It's a decision for all the people in the UK and we should take it on the merits of the European Union debate and not be sidetracked into yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum.""BBC political correspondent Iain WatsonIt was lively. It was feisty. And that was just the audience.The BBC referendum debate gathered together 18 to 29-year-olds from all over the UK to hear four panellists, the youngest of whom - 54-year-old Liam Fox - was a quarter of a century older than the oldest member of the audience.But the most striking contribution came from 60-something Alex Salmond. The former first minister of Scotland didn't just want to talk about this referendum, but the next one.Read more from Iain.During a wide-ranging discussion, the audience criticised both campaigns for using the economy and immigration to ""get the emotions ramped up"". Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the ""scaremongering"" material put out by the Treasury on the Remain side, adding: ""It wouldn't be economic apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more chances if we stay in.""He said: ""That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose.""To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case.""Some of the young voters taking part criticised ""tit-for-tat"" attacks during the campaign, describing it as ""petty name-calling"" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been ""appalling"".She said there had been a focus on migration ""on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government.. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy"". Other issues raised during the debate included travel, the NHS, house prices and jobs. Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, Mr Fox said: ""Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after.""Why do we have these arrangements? Because it is genuinely in the interests of both parties to do so.""But Labour's Mr Johnson said: ""At the moment, we have a very beneficial system we can go anywhere within the EU, it's a two-way process...""There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are you going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas.""He added: ""Unless you put a border and watchtowers across the borders between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, you're going to have people coming across there because you're going to have an EU country and a non-EU country."" Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, UKIP's Ms James said: ""We just don't know"".She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a ""Plan B""."

2016-05-27,G7 leaders warn of Brexit risk to growth,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394905,"A declaration at the G7 meeting in Japan says a vote by the UK to leave the European Union would pose a ""serious threat to global growth"".In its final statement, the group warned that a UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend of increased global trade, investment and jobs. The meeting brings together the world's leading seven industrialised nations. The final communiqué set global growth as a priority for dealing with threats to the world's economy and security.But the warning about the economic consequences of the UK leaving the European Union comes as Britain prepares for a referendum on 23 June. Prime Minister David Cameron has been campaigning for Britain to stay within the 28-country bloc with recent polls suggesting a lead for those who support remaining within the EU. The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideAnalysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondentThat Brexit has been seen as a serious risk to the world economy at the G7 shouldn't surprise anyone. The G7 finance ministers meeting over the weekend in Sendai came to the same conclusion - and it was what the Japanese Central Bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told me in an interview earlier this week. What is surprising is how much of an impact this communique says a yes vote will have on global growth - jobs, investment and trade will be affected. But it's also sentiment - investors are nervous about what Brexit will mean for confidence in Europe and how it will change the landscape of the world economy. No one likes uncertainty, and with 26 days left before the referendum, expect a lot more of these sorts of global statements.After two days of talks, the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan set global growth as an ""urgent priority.""The group pledged to ""collectively tackle"" major risks to global growth, including threats to the international order from terrorist attacks and violent extremism.The statement promised to commit ""to strengthening... policy responses in a cooperative manner and to employing a more forceful and balanced policy mix, in order to swiftly achieve a strong, sustainable and balanced growth pattern"".""We remain committed to ensuring that growth is inclusive and job-rich, benefiting all segments of our societies,"" the document added. They also called for international markets to be kept open to fight all forms of protectionism and for countries to avoid competitive devaluations of their currencies.The G7 has also released an action plan to counter terrorism which they hope will close ""critical gaps"" in capacity and international cooperation. Aside from stepping up information sharing between countries and Interpol, they also said they would improve border control and aviation security. The communiqué described the migrant crisis in Europe ""as a global challenge which requires a global response"" of increased aid from international financial institutions and donor countries.The statement went on to express ""concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas"" where maritime disputes have lead to increasing regional tensions over the past years.  While there is no mention of China and its expansion into territorially disputed waters specifically, the document calls for respecting freedom of navigation and for resolving conflicts peacefully through law."
2016-05-27,UK set to send second warship to Libya,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394597,"The UK is set to send another warship to the Mediterranean to help tackle people-smuggling and movements of arms in and out of Libya, officials say.David Cameron told the G7 summit in Japan that the UK was ready to take an ""active leadership role"" in helping Libya deal with trafficking. The UK currently has one survey vessel, HMS Enterprise, operating in the area.For the UK to send another warship, the EU will need to extend the mandate of its current naval operation.UK officials at this week's meeting of G7 industrialised nations said they would seek UN approval so that the new warship could also seize boats suspected of smuggling arms to fighters of so-called Islamic State in Libya. Last Sunday the new Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli asked the European Union for more help in training its navy and coastguard to stop the trafficking of migrants across the Mediterranean.It is thought this may soon be followed by a request for international ships to operate in Libyan waters.If this request is received, the UK will seek the extension of the EU's Operation Sophia mission to tackle people-trafficking in the central Mediterranean, as well as a Security Council resolution at the UN enabling its forces to assist in the interception of arms shipments.This week the UK sent four military planners to the Rome headquarters of Operation Sophia, with the goal of preparing a plan to improve the effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard.Downing Street did not say what type of Royal Navy ship would be sent and declined to discuss what evidence it had for illicit arms movements from the Libyan coast.Mr Cameron first put forward the idea of extending Operation Sophia into Libyan territorial waters at a Brussels summit of the EU in March.He warned that the number of migrants attempting to cross via the central Mediterranean could be expected to swell once the alternative route through Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans had been closed."
2016-05-27,Hundreds more terror records deleted,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36394494,"Errors that led to fingerprint and DNA records of hundreds of terror suspects being deleted were more widespread than thought, it has emerged. The Biometrics Commissioner said two months ago that 450 profiles had been wrongly deleted from a police database in England and Wales. But in an updated report, Alastair MacGregor revealed the figure was 810. The Home Office, which released the report, said steps were being taken to fix the issue. Under a new system introduced in 2013, DNA and fingerprint profiles of people who are not convicted of a crime have to be removed from a counter-terrorism database. However, the records can be kept in the interests of national security - such as in cases where someone has been suspected of having links to terrorism - when a senior officer makes a national security determination (NSD).But Mr MacGregor said the 810 profiles had been deleted because police officers had failed to make NSD applications in time.He found that in at least 108 cases there would have been national security grounds to store the data and the records ""could and should have been retained"".He added: ""It is obviously very important that steps quickly be taken to establish whether - and, if so, how - replacement material should be obtained from those individuals and/or other action should be taken to minimise any risk which they pose to national security.""Mr MacGregor also revised upwards the number of people on British counter-terrorism databases who have not been convicted of a ""recordable"" offence, from 3,800 to 4,500.However, he said he was ""broadly satisfied"" that the issues he raised were being addressed.A Home Office spokesman said: ""The commissioner has concluded that steps are being taken to address these issues, and the police have provided further assurances that they will be kept under close review.""The government's full response to the commissioner's annual report will be published in due course.""Source: Biometrics Commissioner's annual report, 2015, and Home Office and National DNA database annual report"
2016-05-27,Treasury warns of 'Brexit pension hit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36393513,"The Treasury has warned that millions of current and future pensioners will be worse off if the UK leaves the European Union.Its analysis suggests Brexit would cause inflation to rise, eroding the value of state pension increases, costing recipients £137 a year.Those with an additional pension pot worth £60,000 would see its value drop by £1,900, the Treasury said.However, Vote Leave said the analysis was ""utterly outrageous"".Former Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for Vote Leave, said: ""This is an utterly outrageous attempt by the government to do down people's pensions and is little more than a cynical attempt to distract from the government's broken promises on immigration.""""The biggest threat to British pensions is the European Commission's proposals to undermine occupational pensions, which the government themselves have described as 'damaging and reckless'.""Meanwhile, tax proposals from Eurozone countries will wipe billions off British assets hitting pension funds hardest,"" he said.The Treasury analysis also looked at the impact Brexit would have on someone aged 50.Its analysis found that an individual with pension savings of £20,000, who is contributing 8% of their earnings into a pension fund between now and 2030, would be between £223 and £335 a year worse off in retirement.Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Much of the [Brexit] debate so far has focused on the potential economic fallout of a vote for Leave for those now in work, in terms of the impact on their jobs. ""But it's important that pensioners understand what's at stake for them too on 23 June.""Pensioners who have worked hard all their lives deserve dignity, security and certainty in retirement. That's what we all hope for and what any responsible government should seek to provide,"" the Chancellor said.Pensions minister Baroness Altmann, told the BBC's Today programme, that there was a ""consensus"" among major economic bodies such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the OECD, the head of the IMF and the Bank of England  that the British economy would be weaker if there was a vote to leave the EU.""I have looked at pensions for years. If there is uncertainty, markets do not do well. If there is economic weakness companies cannot do well and that means your investments in pensions and the amount of money put in pensions will fall,"" she added.Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy, Hargreaves Lansdown said such forecasting was ""ambitious"".""The Treasury paints a fairly apocalyptic picture of widespread reductions in retirement incomes. ""The key assumptions they make are of higher inflation and lower economic growth; both of these assumptions may be open to challenge by the Leave campaign. ""Change the underlying assumptions and you change the outcomes."" The state pension has been subjected to a triple lock since 2010, ensuring it rises each year by whichever is higher - inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.He said at the moment state pensioners were receiving annual increases above the rate of inflation.Higher prices would erode this benefit, but because state pension increases are pegged to inflation their standard of living would be maintained.Mr McPhail said higher prices are likely to be more of a problem for some final salary pensions and many individual annuities that are not fully inflation-proofed.""Higher inflation could therefore undermine the real value of these incomes.""However we also note that a rise in bond yields following a Leave vote could equally have a significant beneficial impact on final salary scheme deficits.""He said a recent survey by fund managers conducted by Hargreaves Lansdown on the impact of Brexit, found the majority agreed it would mean lower GDP over 1 to 2 years, but more than a fifth suggested it could be higher in 5-10 years. In the longer term they forecast Brexit would have no impact on the economy."
2016-05-27,"Net migration to UK rises to 333,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382199,"Net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates - the second highest figure on record.Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high.Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been ""cynical"" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK was part of the EU.Speaking to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Conservative MP and former London Mayor said it was ""cynical and unacceptable to say you can fulfil that pledge"".""I think that they (the figures) show the scandal of the promise made by politicians repeatedly that they could cut immigration to the tens of thousands and then to throw their hands up in the air and say there's nothing we can do because Brussels has taken away our control of immigration,"" he said.Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU in June's referendum, said he was pro-immigration but there was ""no public consent for the scale of immigration we are seeing"" and the situation was ""completely out of control"".He said that the only solution was to leave the EU, saying that a vote to stay in the union would mean people ""kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration"".Laura Kuenssberg said the immigration figures ""could hardly have come at a more sensitive time, just when the referendum campaign is moving into a more brutal and frantic phase"".Home Office minister James Brokenshire said David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU, which will see restrictions placed on the benefits new arrivals can claim and a crackdown on ""sham marriages"", would ""close back-door routes"" into the country. ""Leaving the EU is absolutely no panacea or silver bullet,"" he added, telling BBC News that net migration from outside the EU was higher than from within it and leaving would ""wreck the economy and harm jobs"". In other developments, with four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June on whether to stay in or leave the EU:According to the Office for National Statistics, there was a 20,000 rise in net migration to the UK from the 313,000 for the year to December 2014.The figure is well above the government's aim of getting it to the ""tens of thousands"" and is the highest recorded for a calendar year.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.A Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether Mr Cameron remained committed to that target but said the government would ""continue to look at what more might be done"".The spokesman added: ""Of course people rightly have concerns on immigration but the PM's view is very clearly that wrecking the economy and destroying jobs by getting rid of our privileged access to the world's biggest market is not the answer.""He said the Leave campaign failed to spell out what would happen to migration if the UK left the EU, with some saying ""they will cut migration while telling other groups that they will keep freedom of movement or increase visas"".Thursday's figures show estimated levels of long-term migration into the UK from within the EU and outside in the year to December 2015.They show that 270,000 EU citizens moved to the UK for at least a year in 2015, up from 264,000 in 2014. The number of non-EU citizens moving to the UK was 277,000, down from 287,000 in 2014.The rise in the net figure was the result of a fall in the numbers of people emigrating.Analysis By Home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe net migration figure is just short of the record but that statistic alone doesn't do justice to the global picture and the UK's place in it. Everywhere you look, people are on the move - coming and going depending on economic and political circumstances. EU immigration is relatively stable - although there are more southern Europeans than before thanks to the Eurozone's economic doldrums. One really interesting figure, that doesn't affect the population headcount - officially at least - is the 110,000 rise in short-term immigration to about 1.2m. More people are coming for less than a year - such as short contract workers selected by employers who are looking internationally for the best people at the most competitive price. But it will also include some Brits who spend part of the year here - and the rest living in the sun. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the numbers show ""mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU, going on with disastrous open borders"".But former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett warned that an agreement with France to allow British border controls at Calais and the Eurostar terminals in Paris and Brussels would be at risk if Britain left the EU. He criticised Leave campaigners for wanting to create a ""fortress Britain"" - and defended the last Labour government's record immigration, saying ""We didn't just simply say to Poles coming in back in 2004, just come here, we said we'd rather you come here and work than be in the sub-economy."" He added: ""40% of those who registered to work back in 2004 were already in the country and the reason I make that point is because a lot of people would come in illegally if we didn't have the border controls on French soil.""  The Institute of Directors said the public was ""being very poorly served by the current level of the debate on immigration"" and people came to work in the UK because it is one of ""best performing economies in Europe"".""Employment is at a record high, and there are big skills gaps that employers cannot fill domestically. Despite the overblown rhetoric that today's figures have sparked, the actual numbers have not changed much in the last year,"" said IoD employment spokesman Seamus Nevin.Other ONS figures on employment show:How to follow the BBC One EU referendum debate"
2016-05-27,French unions oppose Hinkley Point,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36394601,"The future of the planned new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point remains in doubt as key French unions still oppose the project, BBC Newsnight has learned. EDF, which would build the plant, had delayed a decision on the project in Somerset until the summer while it consulted French union representatives.The company, which is 85% French state-owned, had hoped to win support from a committee of workplace representatives. But the committee said staff had not been reassured about the plant's costs.Trade union representatives hold six of the 18 seats on EDF's board.Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of the Central Works Committee that EDF consulted with, told Newsnight that staff feared the cost of the project would cripple EDF.He said: ""We have reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation, and procurement.""The trade unions are unlikely to give their blessing to the project in its current state. All you need to know about Hinkley Point""We are not reassured by the documents we have received. We have been given a marketing folder, not the full information we require.""We got the documents on 9 May - we are sending EDF a request for more explanations.""On Monday French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron wrote to MPs on Westminster's energy select committee to reassure them the French government remained committed to the project.But Mr Macron added: ""It is also necessary, in the interests of all, that EDF follows due process before committing itself to an investment of this magnitude. ""The consultation of the Central Works Committee brings legal robustness on the decision.""EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz also told MPs on the committee that he did not know when a final decision on the project would be made.Earlier this month, French President Francois Hollande said he would like the project to go ahead.Hinkley Point C, which would provide 7% of the UK's total energy requirements, had originally been meant to open in 2017. But it has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project.While one third of the £18bn capital costs of the project are being met by Chinese investors, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company.In March, Thomas Piquemal, EDF's chief financial officer, quit after his proposal to delay the project by three years was rejected by colleagues.In April, French Energy Minister Ségolène Royale also suggested the project should be delayed.Much of this scepticism is the consequence of problems in constructing nuclear power stations to similar designs elsewhere. A plant being built by EDF at Flamanville in Normandy, northern France, has been hit by years of delays and spiralling costs. Furthermore, since the company is nationally owned, the decision is also subject to political pressure. A former energy adviser to the French government told Newsnight that while EDF did not technically need the backing of the trade union representatives, it would be very difficult, politically, to go ahead without it.Yves Marignac said: ""Going for it would for the government be crossing a red line in their relationship with the trade unions, which would make it really difficult for the government, particularly with the perspective of the next general election when they will need to get some support of the trade unions.""Making a decision for the project is not possible right now.

These people turned up at the event intent on causing disruption.""When our team left the area, the gorilla was still in good spirits and dancing around and didn't look like he had been punched.""The man in the gorilla suit claims he was elbowed in the ribs and punched in the face by a man who was screaming at him.The other man, local Lib Dem candidate John Romero, described the attitude of Leave supporters as ""an absolute disgrace, beyond belief"".He claims he was pushed two metres down steps of the historic Buttercross as he tried to heckle Mr Johnson's speech. Police are appealing for witnesses and are examining photographic evidence of both assaults. "
2016-05-27,Procurement costs 'slashed outside EU',https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382197,"""Foolish"" EU procurement rules cost UK taxpayers £1.6bn a year, which could be better spent on new hospitals and flood defences, Leave campaigners have said.Existing laws imposed a big bureaucratic burden on companies, Vote Leave said, with no regard to the size of contracts or who was tendering.An estimated 1.9 million days were lost a year in red-tape delays, it added.But Remain campaigners said their opponents' wider economic arguments were ""falling apart"".Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the Leave team were ""becoming increasingly desperate"" and claimed the figures cited showed that Norway and Iceland, which are outside the EU, faced higher procurement costs than the UK. The British public will decide whether to vote to stay in the EU or leave in a referendum on 23 June.In other developments:On Wednesday the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the budgetary gains from leaving the EU could be outweighed by the subsequent economic damage while the head of the World Trade Organization said the UK could face £9bn in import tariffs outside the EU. As it seeks to turn the spotlight on the risks of remaining in the EU, Vote Leave has published new research it says shows the extent to which EU procurement processes are harming business competitiveness.Procurement laws, it says, are an integral part of the EU's internal market, from which it wants to withdraw. The threshold at which procurement legislation applies is set too low, it says, inhibiting businesses from bidding for contracts above that level, while the rules cover purely domestic tenders, including the bulk of government contracts, unrelated to foreign trade.The government, Vote Leave says, promised to alleviate the burden on private companies and public authorities of complying with the ""onerous"" rules - including the requirement to advertise all major tenders in EU publications and to read a 128-page code of contract regulations - but it did not feature in Mr Cameron's renegotiations of the UK's membership.How to follow BBC One's EU Referendum debateVote Leave says complying with EU rules has cost the British taxpayer £1.7bn in each of the past five years, funds which it says would pay for 25 new hospitals, 273,000 basic state pensions as well as increased spending on NHS drugs and road maintenance.It arrived at the figure of £8.4bn over five years by multiplying the amount spent by government on current and capital procurement every year and multiplying that by the estimated cost of EU compliance, taking into account inflation. Separate analysis suggests two million days have been lost in each of the past five years because of delays in finalising contracts. Vote Leave has cited a European Commission report in 2011 suggesting UK contracts took 193 days on average to progress from tender to award, longer than any other EU member apart from Greece and Malta. Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a leading Leave campaigner, has previously said EU procurement rules constrained government efforts to build new schools and refurbish existing ones when he was education secretary. Speaking on Thursday, he said: ""If we vote Leave, we can scrap the EU's foolish rules on how Whitehall runs procurement processes, which add billions to the cost of government every year,"" he said.""I've experienced firsthand in the Department for Education how these rules add significant operational costs and generate expensive delays to construction projects. ""Across Whitehall, there are billions to save after we vote Leave.""But the Leave campaign has been accused of overstating the amount that would be saved by leaving the single market and circumventing existing EU regulation.

2016-05-27,Warning over steel pension cut proposal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36384508,"The government has been warned that a plan to cut pension benefits to help save Tata Steel's UK operations could take ministers down a ""dangerous path"".Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb urged caution over ""rushed changes"" he said could have implications for workers ""well beyond the steel industry"".A £485m pension deficit has been deterring potential buyers of Tata.Ministers are considering changing the measure used for British Steel pension increases to cut its liabilities. The government is expected to propose basing the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the current Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure.Some union leaders are likely to support the proposals, the BBC understands.But Mark Turner of the Unite union cautioned that he wanted to see the detail.""We don't want to make changes if they're going to be detrimental to the rest of industry,"" he told the BBC.In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members; it is not clear how many of those would be affected by the plan.Further details are likely to emerge later when the government announces a consultation on the proposals in a written statement to the House of Commons.Former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: ""The government is going down a very dangerous path.""Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry.""The suggestion is that the new rules would stipulate that a company could only change their pension liabilities in an emergency. But, speaking to the BBC, Mr Webb said the term emergency was ""ill-defined"" and that companies could create them artificially in order to reduce their pension payouts.""Once there's a loophole that says you can walk away from promises you've made. Other [companies] could walk away,"" he said, adding that he thought there could also be legal challenges.Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said steel workers' pensions ""must be protected"".""If these reports are accurate, the secretary of state for work and pensions should come to the House to explain precisely what is being proposed, including how current and future steel pensioners will be affected and what precedents might be set by any changes to hard-won pension protection legislation,"" he added. The pension fund and its deficit have been a source of unease for the current owners Tata and a deal-breaker for any would-be buyers.Reducing its burden will make a sale easier and may even convince Tata to hang on to its UK steel business. Any such change would be very controversial as it would set what some would see as a dangerous precedent.The move is evidence of the business secretary's sense of urgency to resolve an industrial crisis which has put 10,000 steel workers' jobs in imminent danger. The BBC understands that union leaders have accepted that this proposal is a better deal than seeing the pension scheme shunted into the lifeboat of the Pensions Protection Fund, which can see some members lose 10% of their payout immediately and see lower increments in future years.  Who are the potential bidders?Jack: How Excalibur and Liberty could join forcesThe rise and fall of Britain's steel industryWhen asked about the proposal to cut the pension deficit, Business Minister Anna Soubry told Channel 4 News: ""We have always said we would do everything we can to look at pensions. ""The prime minister said 'no stone to be unturned' and that is exactly what has been done.""Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones told the programme that there were better ways of dealing with the scheme than putting it in the Pensions Protection Fund, which would take on the deficit, but would also result in members losing some of their benefits.""The UK government has more levers it can pull than we can with its control of the tax system and pensions legislation,"" he said.Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Mr Jones visited Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata executives.It was thought the company might announce a shortlist of bidders, but Tata would only say that bids were still under ""active consideration"".Are you a steelworker?

The biggest single donation was £850,000 from International Motors Ltd. The various campaigns for the UK to remain in the EU collectively declared £1,573,402 over the same period, the bulk of which was raised by Britain Stronger In Europe.Its largest donations were both for £250,000, one from the Bet365 group and one from Mark Coombs.The group said it had received an ""excellent response from across the UK"", with more than 13,000 donations of £50 or less.But it said the difference in amounts raised ""highlights the hypocrisy of the deep-pocketed Leave campaigns and their claims about 'the establishment', which will ring increasingly hollow as it becomes apparent how well-funded they are"".Vote Leave has said it is in a ""David and Goliath"" fight against the Remain camp - pointing to banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have funded the campaign. It has also accused Ryanair of breaking electoral law in its pro-EU campaign.On Thursday, a spokesman for Vote Leave said the Remain campaign could ""still rely on the big banks to fill their coffers"" but the public were being ""turned off by a campaign to do down the British economy"".""The fact that funding is drying up for the In campaign shows that the financial support for 'Project Fear' is collapsing,"" the Vote Leave spokesman said."

The airline dubbed the campaign ""Leave loonies"".The UK votes on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.Chancellor George Osborne, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Liberal Democrat Sir Vince Cable gave speeches making the case for remaining in the EU in front of a sign-written aircraft at Ryanair's base at Stansted Airport.It has been reported that Ryanair intends to spend €25,000 (£18,980) on a campaign for Remain. It has offered discounted flights to passengers who want to fly home to vote to stay in the EU.The airline may be able to disregard the spending rules as it is registered as a company in Ireland. A Ryanair spokesman told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: ""The Leave campaign must be getting really desperate if they're objecting to low-fare air travel for British citizens.""With less than four weeks to go, we will continue to work hard to help deliver a resounding Remain majority on 23 June - and ensure that the Leave loonies don't ban low-fare air travel too.""An Electoral Commission spokesman said it had ""received a complaint from Vote Leave regarding the campaigning activity of Ryanair at the EU referendum"".It added: ""We are establishing the facts before determining what, if any, further steps to take.""Earlier in May, Vote Leave reported Ryanair to the Metropolitan Police accusing it of bribery for offering discounted flights home to Remain voters - a suggestion rejected by Ryanair, which announced it would extend its offer.A series of major companies have given the Remain campaign their public backing but only the recruitment firm Adecco, a TV documentary producer and an advertising firm are registered campaigners so far.Adecco said it had registered because it had sponsored a single panel event with a think tank."

At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%.

2016-05-27,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."
2016-05-27,Is it 'workin'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380007,"The battle between the Remain and Leave sides in the EU referendum is in full swing and social media is being used by both camps to try to win the race.Younger voters have so far been slower to register to vote and campaigners are keen to win their attention and support.Some strategies have enjoyed surprise success while others have misfired completely. The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be. As PR strategy consultant Deborah Mattinson says: ""Social media campaigns need to be totally spot on or it's absolutely awful.""Compiled by Zak Brophy"

2016-05-27,Success and failure,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36370560,"Adam Lang, the fictional British Prime Minister in Robert Harris' novel The Ghost faces prosecution for war crimes in an international court. Lang is not so much a thinly veiled portrait of Tony Blair as an explicitly, obviously exotic extension, with added warts and delusions, of our former prime minister.Now, according to one Sunday newspaper, the Chilcot inquiry could, in reality, accuse Tony Bair of such crimes. The added spice is that while Lang merely faced his former foreign secretary, current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would apparently back Blair's prosecution at the Hague. No novelist would be quite so obvious as to cast his revenging fury as a current party leader, the very embodiment of all his victim had exiled from mainstream politics. The Ghost indeed.The Labour Party is still haunted by the manifest success and equally spectacular failure of Tony Blair. Mr Blair has just suggested that simple lessons should be learnt about genies and bottles, saying: ""We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and that would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime.""Chilcot may not be as dramatic as the weekend headlines suggest, but it is still very far from ancient history. What is the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war for?Iraq Inquiry: Timeline of key momentsThe legacy of the Iraq War is a critical part of the vital, current debate within the Labour party. Still, Mr Blair looms too large for his erstwhile supporters to either praise him or bury him. Crucially, the road to Baghdad was paved with political ambitions for his party.One was dealing with the outsized fear, after 9/11, of enemies getting hold of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The mingling of realistic fears, the actual facts and convenient fantasy is what Chilcot has to disentangle, and there will be plenty of time to chew over the findings.What may get lost is the wider context of Mr Blair's enthusiasm for action.Central to Mr Blair's transformation of the Labour Party was killing off negative perceptions that the party was ""too left wing"" for power. He didn't bother to dispute the accusations of a hostile press and the worries of swing voters - instead his technique was to flamboyantly adopt policies that spoke loudly of their opposite. In one area, he saw a double lock on Labour's door to power - the claims it was:Both had deep roots, from the pacifism of party leader George Lansbury in the 1930s to protests over Vietnam in the 1960s.But more important was CND in the 1980s and a view of the world that saw the US not as a valiant bulwark in a Cold War against tyranny, but the inheritor of an Western imperial legacy, giving succour to dictators and oppressors who made the world safe to sell Coca-Cola. Jeremy Corbyn was firmly, prominently, consistently one of those who saw the ills of the world through the lens of American imperial power. Mr Blair thought the world needed that power, almost irrespective of its actual actions.Curious as it seems in retrospect, he feared that George W Bush (pre-9/11) would disengage the US from the world. An enthusiastic ""liberal interventionist"", as set out in his Chicago speech, Tony Blair realised the US was an essential part of his vision of a West that righted wrongs with enthusiasm and military power. As he has made clear since, he didn't just go along with President Bush.""It's worse than you think,"" he said. ""I believe in it. I am truly committed to dealing with this, irrespective of the position of America.""If the Americans were not doing this, I would be pressing for them to be doing so."" He is still at it, urging a new ground war in Syria and Iraq, involving the UK, US and France.Born: 6 May 1953Educated: Choristers school, Fettes, OxfordFamily: Married, four children1976: Barrister specialising in trade union and employment law1983: Labour MP for Sedgefield, shadow City spokesman1984-87: Shadow trade and industry minister1987-88: Shadow energy secretary1989-92: Shadow employment secretary1992-94: Shadow home secretary1994-97: Opposition leader1997-2007: Prime minister, winning three successive general elections2007-2015: Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East2008: Launched the Tony Blair Faith FoundationAfter Mr Blair, after Iraq Labour supporters could bitterly, wryly, reflect that their party had put to bed forever the idea that it was weak on defence, such was his enthusiasm for offensive action. Except that is no longer true. We are witnessing the same old debates, the same old questions, about Trident, about Nato, about military spending. And perhaps that is appropriate. But it is not very helpful for the Labour party itself to be squabbling in the past tense.On the eve of the Iraq War, I reflected that we were sailing into uncharted waters - a British prime minister taking a country into a war, that as far as one can tell, the population didn't want. A war against the will of the people. It could have turned out differently, perhaps. But no WMD were found, and the occupation was both occasionally brutal and usually incompetent. New Labour staggered on, but those who had always mistrusted Mr Blair found a fitting locus for their dislike.Party members and voters peeled off, so slowly, but so certainly.His behaviour out of office has made him even more of a hate figure for some on the left. Although he is the ghost who haunts the party's halls, he is a very bouncy, upbeat, jet-setting sort of spirit - defiantly unapologetic, made extravagantly rich in part, some say, by consorting with questionable regimes. I can't be the only one who sees something of Mr Blair in Hugh Laurie's brilliant portrayal of Richard Roper in the Night Manager - not that anyone's suggesting Mr Blair is a corrupt arms dealer, its just there's something familiar about his breezy, easy way with power, wealth and entourage.Wherever Mr Corbyn's subsequent career takes him, it is impossible to imagine him following these footsteps. It is only one of the myriad ways in which he is the austere anti-Blair. Not, however, Mr Blair's exorcist, but his primal antithesis, all the tribe's most atavistic instincts reanimated, all that Mr Blair buried, resurrected.  He will not lay the family ghost.The leadership may despise Mr Blair's techniques for winning power - but they haven't yet found their own.Part of Mr Blair's skill was in the much-mocked art of triangulation, rising above left and right, to hover somewhere not only midway between the two, but with a certain degree of moral altitude above both. No-one in the Labour party has yet attempted this between Mr Blair and Mr Corbyn. It is perhaps too soon. But the world does not wait. The lessons drawn from Iraq by a former senior civil servant may be clear by the late summer, but the foreign policy debate generally grows ever more complex.It is too early for Labour to deal with its devils, but it will probably means it will be stuck in a black-and-white debate in an increasingly multi-hued world."
2016-05-27,Nick Robinson,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378655,"A pinch of cardamom, a little coriander and a smattering of cinnamon - all ingredients not just in a great British curry but in a political row that's been bubbling up in the kitchens of Indian restaurants up and down the country. It begins with a question - where is the next generation of curry chefs going to come from - and ends in with another - would leaving the EU save your local Indian from closing? Currently two or three curry restaurants are shutting every week. Now, you may think you know the answer to where Indian chefs come from. If so think again. For decades your ""Indian"" - whether a chicken tikka masala or late night vindaloo - was almost certainly cooked by a chef from Bangladesh or, perhaps, someone whose father was.  Not any more though. The voices you hear in a growing number of kitchens above the noise of the chopping and the sizzling are the voices of East Europeans - in particular Romanians. The reason is that tougher immigration rules mean it simply costs too much for most restaurants to bring new chefs over here. White thug poster aimed at ethnic minority votersPolls reveal divided nationEthnic minorities could be key, says UKIPA decade or so ago a curry chef would earn around £15,000 a year. Now, a restaurant has to pay almost double that as well as jumping a series of complex bureaucratic hurdles to persuade the Home Office to allow them to bring in a chef from abroad. ""Abroad"" means, of course, not from outside the UK but outside the EU.Pasha Khandakar, the president of the Bangladesh Caterers Association, told me that this was an ""immigration double standard"".""We've been told by British ministers to import European Union people,"" he said, pointing to a ""language problem, a culture problem and a smell problem."" He contends that Eastern European workers dislike the smell of curries. ""We have to give chance for everyone in this world who's fit for these jobs - not for their colour, not for their geographical identity.""""Why should it be easier and cheaper to hire a Romanian to work in a curry house than a Bangladeshi?"" many British Asians ask. Why, indeed, should it be so easy for Eastern Europeans to bring their families to live with them when it is now so much harder than it once was for the families of British people with Commonwealth roots to do the same? It is the widespread feeling that immigration rules now discriminate against them and their families which Brexit campaigners have sought to tap into. Indeed, the employment minister and prominent Leave campaigner, Priti Patel, has claimed that a vote to quit the EU is the only way to save the curry industry.That depends on a very big assumption. That following Brexit the British public would become so relaxed about immigration that politicians felt able to relax the immigration rules that stop low paid and low skilled workers coming here from elsewhere. At Le Raj in Epsom - an upmarket restaurant in Surrey which is a favourite of Chris Tarrant and Heston Blumenthal - that's not how they see things. The head chef here is a Bangladeshi. Recently he's had to brush up on his language skills - to learn not English but Romanian. His kitchen is manned now by people who had never smelt a curry never mind cooked one before coming to work under his tutelage. The boss of the Raj, Jeffrey Ali, is as frustrated as anyone in his industry with the current immigration rules but he tells me that he simply does not believe any politician will want ""to touch relaxing the rules with a 10 foot pole"". ""If immigration were to be brought down, even by half, there would still be no onus from any politician to say, 'Ok now because we have less people coming from the EU, let's bring in more people from the Commonwealth,'"" said Mr Ali, who plans to vote Remain in the referendum. Not least when unemployment is high amongst the British Bangladeshi community whose children choose, he argues, to claim benefit rather than to take the relatively low pay and long hours that their parents once worked as waiters or chefs. Brexit, he believes, offers a false dawn for an industry that needs to do more to raise its status and to train the next generation of chefs. Jeffrey Ali is helping to sponsor a new academy down the road to teach cooking to young British born people in the hope that one day he will not be forced to choose between immigrants he cannot afford and those who know as much about curry as he knows about Romanian cuisine.Immigration is the main reason people who plan to Vote Leave give for their choice. What's clear, though, is that even if we do vote to quit the EU on the 23rd June the debate about how much immigration we need and want and can afford as a country will stay firmly on the menu alongside  the question - who will cook and serve my Indian in the future?"
2016-05-27,The Great Escape?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382206,"Welcome aboard the top deck of an open top Daimler Fleet Line double decker.A jalopy of such vintage, I'm told, Torvill and Dean used it for a victory parade in Nottingham in 1984. And it was in its second decade then.In an era of airtight political choreography, this is a campaign that's sufficiently breezy that the party leader shouts ""duck"" on the upper deck as we all get whacked by branches when the bus goes under some trees.Think what you like about the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but two things from this vantage point seem indisputable. This referendum is happening because of the impact he's had on British politics.And who else at Westminster is up for the kind of campaigning he does?Arriving in Chapeltown, just north of Sheffield, the loudspeakers gaffer taped onto the upper deck are turned on. Eager members of the small Team Farage are instructed to cling on to said speakers, such is the fear that gravity might triumph over them.The music to The Great Escape pumps out, to a Farage chuckle; a joke the veteran MEP can't resist. The response as the bus slows is binary: from the Anglo Saxon unbroadcastable insult, hollered with gusto, to the thumbs up and smile from the nonagenarian woman at the bus stop.Pulling up outside the Wagon and Horses, Mr Farage is the unlikely voice of temporary prohibition. It's just gone 10am and he had been after a coffee; some of his activists were necking lager half an hour earlier.He leaps off the bus and starts chatting. Sure, these affairs attract the converted, the committed, the convinced. Even the evangelical.Bits of slogan-emblazoned cardboard aloft, some approach him as if Bono or Bieber have rolled up. Kisses, autographs, all the rest of it.But he has a crack too at passers by, the unconvinced, the unconverted, but persuadable. And one or two who have no intention of being persuaded at all. Mr Farage appears to be attempting to take on the crater-sized criticism screamed at him by his opponents also wanting the UK to vote to leave the EU.Their critique is simple: he can motivate those who agree with him, but he's toxic amongst those who don't, and don't yet. The big question is this: given his binary appeal, are they right? His argument is this: look how many people I've won over so far.They argue this is a race to get half of those who vote, plus one more. Can he convince those crucial floating voters?Lunch, as you might have guessed, is at a pub. High on Saddleworth Moor, the Rams Head flies a St George's flag in the car park.His persuading and charming, arguing and chatting, continues with whoever he meets. By two o'clock we are back on the vintage bus.Whatever you do, don't ask for the wifi code or where the toilet is. A corkscrew appears. Briefly entertaining the idea that, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang like, it might be to get the charabanc going again, I ask what it's for.The Rioja appears. After all, we are half an hour down the M62 away from the next campaign stop in Bolton. So let's be clear: you might have noticed this was an entertaining, engaging and refreshing day on the campaign trail. Refreshing, indeed, in all sorts of ways. But here are the big questions: Does Nigel Farage change minds among the unconvinced to win a referendum? Or do too many people simply not like him?It's a massive unanswered question. Can an approach to politics - as different as his is - actually lead it to the very highest success?Can a man who has turbo charged an outfit from a dusty room in the London School of Economics into a major player in British politics, actually achieve the only thing he ever set out to do - get the UK out of the EU?And, afterwards, whether win or lose, what on earth does he do next?"

2016-05-27,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160527053537/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010.

The government is aiming to cut this figure to under 100,000.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high, and 188,000 for non-EU.In response to the letter, Number 10 said: ""This is a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that the overwhelming majority of economists and businesses believe leaving the single market would be disastrous for jobs, prices and opportunities for people.""Nine in 10 of the UK's top economists agree that leaving the EU would damage the country's economy, according to a survey published in the Observer.According to an IPSOS Mori poll of more than 600 economists, 88% of those who replied said leaving the EU single market would damage Britain's growth prospects over the next five years.Britain Stronger in Europe campaign director Will Straw said: ""This is the final nail in the coffin of the Leave campaign's economic credibility.""It is becoming clear that leaving is a risk we simply cannot afford to take.""It comes as former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major criticised the Vote Leave campaign in the Mail on Sunday.He wrote: ""As the referendum vote comes nearer, I again ask the senior figures of Vote Leave to correct the inaccuracies and falsehoods they are peddling to the British people.""On the issue of immigration from Europe, he said the Leave campaign ""seems more focused on raising fears than setting out facts"".""Their cavalier exaggeration of likely immigration flows has been the most distasteful aspect of this referendum campaign,"" he said.""Vote Leave has consistently failed to tell us how they see the UK outside Europe.

They took control of Sanaa in 2014.A coalition of Arab air forces, led by Saudi Arabia, began carrying out air strikes on the rebels in March 2015, saying it was ""defending the legitimate government"" of Mr Hadi. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates at least 3,200 civilians have been killed and 5,700 wounded, with 60% of the casualties inflicted by air strikes, in the year since the air strikes began."

But it's a big challenge for the centre... It would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policy-making, left or right.""He added: ""I do think the centre ground needs to work out how it recovers... gets its mojo back and gets the initiative back in the political debate, because... these guys aren't providing answers, not on the economy, not on foreign policy.""John McDonnell, shadow chancellor and close ally of Mr Corbyn dismissed Mr Blair's comments.""I find that a bit rich from a prime minister who took us into the Iraq war which resulted in half a million deaths. So I think it's inappropriate for him to comment and I look forward to the Chilcot report,"" he said.Sir John Chilcot's long-awaited report into how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath, is to be published on 6 July.Ahead of its publication, Mr Blair told This Week's World: ""I have a real humility about the decisions that I took and the issues around them.""I was trying to deal with this in the aftermath of 9/11 and it was very tough - it was very difficult.""The former PM, who set up a foundation which works to promote greater understanding between the world's religions and to challenge extremism and prejudice, said the West was not to blame for the situation in the Middle East.And he warned of bigger terrorist attacks on Europe in future.""You've got to open your eyes to the problem. If we don't do that we're going to store up an even bigger problem for ourselves, and we face the problem in Europe, I'm afraid, of even bigger terror attacks.""I think we need to be in no doubt at all about the people we're dealing with here. If they could kill larger numbers of people that's what they would do,"" he said.The threat, he said, was ""different... from anything we have faced before"" and he said it required a ""different type of policy response and... a different rhythm of thinking"", as it would be a ""generation fight, it's not a fight that's going to be resolved in one year, two years, or even 10"".Mr Blair also called for action to redress the widespread problem of indoctrination of Muslim children in extremist ideologies across the Middle East. He said there needed to be a global commitment, where countries promoted cultural tolerance and rooted out cultural prejudice within their education systems.""If you end up polluting the mind of your people as they're growing up within your country, in today's world where the boundaries come down where there is much more migration and integration, then that is not just for your country - it's a problem for all of us.""

2016-05-28,Miliband 'call to arms' for young voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36403826,"Former Labour leader Ed Miliband has issued a ""call to arms"", urging young people to register to vote in next month's EU referendum.The absence of millions of young voters from the electoral register could lead to a victory for the Leave camp in the EU referendum, he warned. Mr Miliband said their ""optimistic generation"" can keep Britain in the EU.But Leave campaigner, Conservative MP James Cleverly, said Mr Miliband's ""cynical"" comments would ""fool no-one"". Mr Miliband said in a speech in London on Saturday that 1.5 million of the six million 18-24 year olds eligible to vote are not registered, nor are a quarter of the eight million 25-35 year olds.They have until 7 June to register to vote in the UK's referendum on its membership of the EU, which takes place on 23 June. Mr Miliband said: ""Today is a call to arms to all young people to register to vote. ""Let's be clear about the danger - a decision not to vote is a decision to let someone else decide your future.""Young people can decide this referendum. If they don't use their vote, the danger is this referendum will be lost.""The UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsMr Miliband, who resigned as leader of the Labour Party following its defeat in the 2015 general election, said the Leave side offered a ""narrow"" future which pretended to be about national freedom.He added: ""When the Leave campaign is asked about the future - future jobs, future opportunities, future growth - they have one answer: they just don't know.""Those words should ring in the ears of every child, student and parent. Not knowing is not a path to prosperity, not knowing is the road to recession.""Mr Miliband also told BBC Breakfast that polls suggested younger people were more likely to vote to remain in the EU by three to one, and that older people should ""heed the wisdom of the young"".He added: ""All round the world young people are kicking against the establishment, and yet young people want to back Remain. ""That shows Remain is a future-orientated, positive, optimistic idea, because I think young people take for granted that we've got to work with other countries, and not isolate ourselves.""Mr Cleverly said Mr Miliband's ""cynical"" attempt to reach young people ""will fool no-one"". ""After his failed efforts to court the youth vote via Russell Brand last year, you'd think he would know better.""He also told the BBC that he ""absolutely"" wanted young people to vote in the referendum.""When I talk to young people, actually I find that they are very concerned about the costs of EU membership, about how it limits our ability to trade with the developing world, and how it impinges on our democracy.""Meanwhile, pro-Brexit employment minister Priti Patel launched an attack on the economic predictions of her government colleagues in the Treasury.While out campaigning she told the BBC its forecasts have ""been questioned heavily"" and that Vote Leave was ""making the positive economic case as to why we should leave the European Union"".""Of course we can take back control of the money we send to Europe and spend that growing our economic base and invest that in our economic prosperity in future,"" she said.And despite their increasingly personalised battle, David Cameron indicated he still regards Leave campaigner Boris Johnson as a ""substantial"" potential future successor.Mr Cameron said he would not reconsider comments he made that Mr Johnson, George Osborne and Theresa May were all figures who could step into his shoes when he steps down, which he has promised to do before the next general election."
2016-05-28,Vote Leave launches £50m football contest,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36397725,"The campaign to get Britain out of the EU has launched a contest to win £50m - if you can correctly predict the result of all 51 games in the Euro 2016 football championships.If no one manages that then there is a £50,000 prize for the person who gets the most consecutive games correct.Vote Leave has taken out an insurance policy to fund the contest.But Britain Stronger In Europe say it is a ""con"" - with the odds of winning a sextillion to one.The £50m represents the amount Vote Leave says Britain sends to the EU a day, a claim disputed by its critics.The argument that Britain sends £350m a week to the EU has proved controversial because it does not take into account the rebate that the UK gets on its payments to the EU.A Vote Leave source said the football contest could be a ""game changer"" for the campaign because it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.Anyone entering will have to rate themselves on a scale of one to five as to whether they are more likely to back continued membership of the EU.The campaign admits that the chances of winning the top prize are slim - but says it is ""worth a punt"".But Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, said the long odds were the same as those for Vote Leave ""coming up with a coherent vision for what life would look like outside the EU"". He added: ""Once again Vote Leave put wild guesswork at the heart of their campaign and it is the British people who they are asking to take the risk.""Hosts France take on Romania in the first game of Euro 2016 on 10 June, with England and Wales in action the following day.Vote Leave's campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""This is the chance of a lifetime - just imagine what you could do with the £50m we send to the EU every single day. ""We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP.""You are staggeringly unlikely to win this competition.There are 36 games in the group stages of the tournament, when there could be a victory for either side or a draw.Then there are 15 knockout games, which cannot be drawn.The odds of picking all 51 games randomly are one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is a bit better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street.Now, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages, which may go down to goal difference or even goals scored.The competition is a based on a similar contest in the US, run by billionaire Warren Buffett, one of the world's richest men, involving the annual men's NCAA basketball tournament known as March Madness.Vote Leave says the contest is free to enter and is open to anyone who is over the age of 18 who is registered to vote in the EU referendum. Entrants must supply their telephone number, email address and home address to qualify for the prize.Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to ""opt out"" from receiving campaign information ""at any time"".A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said any money spent on the contest would have to be reported by the campaign, but added: ""Vote Leave indicate that the £50m prize would be paid by an insurance company and not by them.""The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has again rebuked Vote Leave over its £350m a week claim.In a statement on the authority's website, Sir Andrew Dilnot said that he was ""disappointed"" that the campaign group continued to claim the full amount could be spent in the UK, saying it ""undermined trust in official statistics""."

Mr Johnson has previously said voters want proper debate and to hear about the issues, ""not personal attacks"".The UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The Conservative Party is deeply split over the the issue, with David Cameron and most of his cabinet campaigning for a Remain vote but about half of the MPs supporting an EU exit.The debate inside the party has turned increasingly acrimonious, with former deputy prime minister and pro-Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine recently accusing Mr Johnson of losing his judgement over the EU.Lord Patten, Tory party chairman from 1990 to 1992, added to that criticism of the former London mayor, in an interview with Newsnight's David Grossman on Friday.""Boris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that,"" he said.""There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar. I think he's one of those people in life who simply doesn't really understand the difference between fact and fiction.""He added: ""If he can make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it - and he doesn't think about it.""He'll be saying the opposite in a few months' time.""Lord Patten, a European commissioner from 2000 to 2004, said Mr Johnson was an ""amiable"" character, but added: ""Boris is Boris. Tommy Cooper was Tommy Cooper.""In response, Vote Leave said: ""It's sad to see the level of debate the 'Remainers' have been reduced to. They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now.""And speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's ""anger is almost certainly synthetic"".The MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to ""bash down"" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was ""hugely popular and trusted"" and was making the case for an EU exit ""exceptionally effectively"".The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that ""senior party figures"" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign.On the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be ""very difficult"" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader.""Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU?""I don't know,"" he said.Lord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together.But he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health.""That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,"" he said.Lord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be ""to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote"", which , he said, was ""extraordinary"".And he added: ""I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum.""Also in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro.""I put my hand up,"" he said. ""Everybody occasionally makes a mistake and I think I was wrong about that."""
2016-05-28,EU campaigns 'misleading voters',https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36397732,"Both sides in the EU referendum campaign have been accused of peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"" by a committee of MPs.The Treasury Select Committee calls Vote Leave's claim that Brexit would save £350m a week ""deeply problematic"".And it says Remain's claims families would be worse off by £4,300 a year if Britain quit the EU were ""mistaken"" and had ""probably confused"" voters.The rival groups are failing to inform the public, the MPs say.Vote Leave's £350m-a-week claim - repeated again today - does not take into account Britain's rebate and payments that flow back to the UK, the committee, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, says.""Vote Leave's persistence with it is deeply problematic,"" the report says.""It sits very awkwardly with its promises to the Electoral Commission to work in a spirit that reflects its 'very significant responsibility' and the 'gravity of the choice facing the British people'."" The committee criticised Chancellor George Osborne over his claim that a Treasury analysis showed that ""families would be £4,300 worse off"" if Britain left the EU.""This is not what the main Treasury analysis found - the average impact on household disposable incomes would be considerably smaller than this number, which refers to the impact on GDP per household,"" the report said.""It may have left many readers thinking that the figures refer to the effect of leaving the EU on household disposable income, which they do not,"" the report added.The report said government departments and Remain campaigners should not repeat this ""mistaken assertion,"" adding: ""To persist with this claim would be to misrepresent the Treasury's own work.""The Claim: The two sides in the EU referendum campaign have been accused of peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"" by a committee of MPs.Reality Check verdict: There is growing acceptance that both sides could be clearer about the figures they're using to support their arguments.Read more hereThe committee also finds that it is misleading to claim that three million jobs are dependent on Britain's membership of the EU. ""Without an estimate of how much trade would be lost as a result of Brexit, the impact on job losses cannot readily be estimated,"" it said.""The wider public might form the mistaken impression that all these jobs would be lost or at risk if the UK left the EU. ""Campaigners should be clear that three million jobs may be associated with, but would not necessarily be dependent on, our membership of the EU.""Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Vote Leave's £350m claim was ""by far the most serious claim out there"" which was ""simply not true"". ""But what we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter claims made by both sides on this.""I think it's confusing the public, it's impoverishing political debate... the public are thoroughly fed up with it.""The report also singled out for criticism the behaviour of Vote Leave campaigners Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings, whose treatment of the committee was described as ""appalling"". And the cross-party committee claimed it was ""highly unsatisfactory"" it had been was unable to scrutinise the government's analysis of the short-term impact of Brexit in time to include it in the report.The report says: ""It is to be hoped that scrutiny and transparency have not, in this case, been subordinated to the imperatives of the Number 10 'media grid'.""For Britain Stronger In Europe, Labour MP Wes Streeting said: ""The committee's report has confirmed everyone's suspicions about Vote Leave - that they are a bunch of charlatans who mislead the British people and treat parliamentary democracy with contempt."" He said the ""case is now closed"" on the economy: ""Every expert accepts that leaving would result in an economic shock."" But for Vote Leave, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the committee, said the report ""shows that David Cameron's renegotiation fell short of the ambitions expressed in his Bloomberg speech of January 2013"" and that the Remain campaign had used misleading claims.'Most shockingly the chancellor, George Osborne, has consistently used a figure that he ought to have known would have been misunderstood and has misrepresented the Treasury's own analysis to do so."" The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has again rebuked Vote Leave over the £350m claim.

In a TV debate, Mr Salmond said Scotland could vote for independence within two years of a UK Brexit vote.A SNP spokesman said the former party leader made an ""outstanding"" case for the UK's continued EU membership.During the debate, the MP for Gordon said: ""If you had the situation where Scotland in four weeks' time votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""Such a vote ""would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw"", he stated.While polls across the UK suggest a tight contest between the leave and remain campaigns in the run-up to the June 23 European referendum, research in Scotland suggests a clear majority in favour of staying in the EU.Mr Rennie accused the former first minister of ""behaving like a not-so-secret agent for the leave campaign"" by focusing on Scottish independence, adding that his comments made a vote to leave more likely.He said: ""He spends more time rubbishing the official remain campaign and promoting Scottish independence than making the positive case to remain in Europe.""MSPs at Holyrood overwhelmingly backed a Scottish government motion on Thursday, making clear their support for Scotland and the UK remaining part of the EU.Mr Rennie added: ""This week in parliament, MSPs from all parties made the clear, passionate, positive case for Scotland remaining part of the EU.""But Alex Salmond seems more interested in using the Europe poll to advance the cause of Scottish independence than actively working to keep us in the EU.""Too many senior figures in the SNP are approaching this 2016 referendum with a 2014 mind-set. Alex Salmond is a serial offender.""His threats about another independence vote may encourage his supporters to back Brexit. His attacks on the remain campaign are undermining it and risking Brexit.""On both counts he is risking our place in the European Union, not supporting it. Alex Salmond should opt out of the campaign before he does any more damage.""A spokesman for the SNP said Mr Salmond made an ""outstanding and overwhelming case"" for Scotland and the UK's continued membership of the EU. ""His passionate arguments on the benefits of EU membership on migration, on employment opportunities for younger people and on the wider benefits of membership to our economy were well received by the audience of young people, including when answering a specific question from an audience member about Scottish independence,"" he said. ""Willie Rennie needs to make up his mind quickly what his top priority is - attacking the SNP over everything and anything, or joining our efforts to keep Scotland in Europe.""Meanwhile, Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been in Scotland campaigning for a Leave vote.Mr Farage spoke at a Fishing for Leave conference in Aberdeen, alongside UK government Marine Environment Minister George Eustice.The MEP urged fishermen to ""take back our birthright"" by voting to leave the EU, insisting ""our grandparents didn't fight two world wars...so that we should have to go to Brussels to beg for crumbs from the table.""He also said the UK has ""literally given away our country"" and urged British citizens to fight for their ""birthright""; to ""have the whip hand"" in future negotiations with Europe."
2016-05-28,UK spy agencies 'recruiting more women',https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36396069,"UK intelligence agencies say they are recruiting more female staff - and are targeting middle-age and ""mid-career"" women for jobs.MI6 and and GCHQ advertised on the Mumsnet website for the first time this year, and MI5 has raised its target for women employees to 45% by 2021.Flexible working and the importance of ""high emotional intelligence"" are also being stressed in recruitment.The agencies were responding to calls from MPs to recruit more women.Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee reported in March 2015 that 37% of intelligence agency staff were women and women only make up 19% of senior civil servants in the agencies. One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - ""agree wholeheartedly"" with the need for ""diversity"" in agency staff.It says action has been taken since the report was published to ""increase their focus"" on ""all aspects of diversity"", including recruiting more women.Recruitment targets, ""diversity champions"", events such as a recent ""Women in Cyber"" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion.They also say they are doing more to ""promote a flexible working culture"" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles.The three agencies also said they were always looking for ""new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach"".MI5 had already used Mumsnet as well as local newspapers to target women ""not currently in work"" while the other two agencies did so for the first time this year.GCHQ has also removed a requirement of a 2:1 university degree from its ""fast-stream"" recruitment to encourage women who had followed a ""non-traditional graduate route"".The government said the initiatives were having an effect as MI5 had recently been placed in the Times Top 50 employers for women and had increased its number of new female employees by 5% to 46% of new recruits. GCHQ had seen applications from women rise to 40%. MI6 had increased its female recruitment targets for 2016/17 after seeing a 4% drop in women - to 41% of new recruits.The government also said career support for female staff was having a ""real impact"" with increased numbers of women applying for senior roles in MI5."
2016-05-28,"I'm no secret Brexiteer, says Cameron",https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36396066,"David Cameron has rejected claims he is a ""closet Brexiteer,"" insisting he is  ""passionate"" about staying in the EU.Speaking at the G7 summit in Japan, the prime minister, a leading figure in the Remain campaign, denied reports that his ""instinct"" was to vote Leave.""I am not a closet anything. I have pretty much had the same view about Europe ever since I got involved in active politics,"" the PM said.Boris Johnson told him it was ""not too late"" to join the Leave campaign.With four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June about whether to leave the European Union, there have been reports that Conservative PM Mr Cameron, at heart,  backs ""Brexit,"" as a British exit from the EU is known.Steve Hilton, who was one of Mr Cameron's closest aides before leaving Downing Street in 2012 and who worked alongside him when they were both Tory researchers, told the Times on Thursday: ""If he was a member of the public, or a backbench MP or a junior minister or even a cabinet minister, I'm certain that he would be for Leave. ""That's his whole instinct. That's who he is. As prime minister he sees it from a different perspective and that's perfectly reasonable ... but I think that if he didn't have that perspective, he would be for Leave.""But Mr Cameron, who has described himself as a Eurosceptic, said at the close of the G7 summit:  ""I am not a closet anything. I have pretty much had the same view about Europe ever since I got involved in active politics.""I have always taken the same view, which is that we are better off in this organisation but we should be aiming to reform this organisation, we should be looking to enhance the special status that Britain.""I have never been a closet Brexiteer. I am absolutely passionate about getting the right result, getting this reform in Europe and remaining part of it. It's in Britain's national interest.""He pointed to a joint declaration by the leaders of the G7 countries - the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada - at the end of the two-day Ise-Shima summit, which stated: ""UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend toward greater global trade, investment and the jobs they create and is a further serious risk to growth"".""When you are faced with a difficult decision, it is often a good thing to listen to what your friends think,"" the prime minister said.In an interview with BBC South political editor Peter Henley, one of the most senior Conservatives in the Vote Leave campaign, Boris Johnson noted Mr Hilton's comments and said it was ""not too late"".Asked if he was suggesting Mr Cameron should join him in campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, the former London mayor added: ""Yes. There is more joy in Heaven over one that repenteth. Now is the time. There's a month to go.""He added: ""He has been a believer in democracy and over 20 years or so he has been a strong Eurosceptic.""Mr Cameron, in turn, told LBC radio last week that Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a Leaver"" - Mr Johnson responded that he had ""been a Eurosceptic for decades"".The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that ""senior party figures"" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign."

The bulk of decisions on such laws are made by officials and then nodded through by ministers.""There is no information on how those decisions are reached, including who has had to compromise and at what price. Over 50% of decisions are agreed by consensus, which means policy differences can be invisible to the electorate.""The committee urged the government to ""take action"" to make more information available to the UK Parliament and to take a lead in the EU by ""making public statements of the reason for its vote more frequently""."

2016-05-28,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-28,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this.

Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-28,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36392341,"The claim: Migration to the UK is out of control and will get worse if Britain remains in the EU. Reality Check verdict: Net migration is still at near-record levels. Just over half of it comes from outside the EU. The government has not managed to bring migration from outside the EU down to tens of thousands as the 2010 and 2015 manifestos promised, so it is not clear it would be able to do so with EU migrants post-Brexit.A lot of people are migrating to the UK, and fewer people are leaving. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures on long-term migration every three months, and these basic facts haven't changed for years. Overall net migration stands at 333,000, and has risen more than a third since David Cameron came to power in 2010, with the aim of reducing numbers to tens of thousands a year.If you exclude Brits from the figures, things look even worse for the government's targets. Last year, 373,000 more non-Brits came to live in the UK than left, a 45% increase on 2010.With the referendum fast approaching, campaigners such as Nigel Farage say that immigration can only be brought back down to the tens of thousands if we leave the EU. While the UK can decide which immigrants it accepts from outside the EU, almost anyone from within the EU is entitled to come and live here. While the rest of the EU accounts for about 6% of the world's population, it's now the source of about 49% of UK net migration. That's up from 29% five years earlier, mainly because non-EU migration has steadied off, while EU migration has increased. It may be that the accession of new EU members has fuelled that rise. Home Secretary Theresa May said last month that the EU's free movement rules make controlling immigration ""harder"". But would leaving the EU really mean immigration came crashing down? In theory, the UK could put a block on any more EU citizens coming to live here, and that could cut the net migration figures in half at a stroke. But if that were going to happen to EU migrants, why hasn't it already happened to non-EU migrants? The UK isn't bound to accept them by any international treaties, but nevertheless let 277,000 of them move over last year alone. Three quarters of immigrants move to the UK for work or study, and the ratio is much the same for EU migrants. According to figures from Oxford University, nearly 60% of EU migrants coming over for work have got a job lined up before they arrive.Also, it is possible that a deal to retain access to the single market would require the UK to maintain freedom of movement for EU citizens wanting to come here to work.Unemployment rates have been falling more or less constantly for the past five years, and if the economy remains healthy the UK is likely to need just as many workers in future.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-28,John Pienaar,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/36407446,"Anyone who's followed politics for any length of time knows no party's more prone to suicidal bouts of indiscipline than the Labour Party.Unless, of course, it's the Conservative Party when it's in the mood.Just now, the Tories are in more of a mood than they've been since the chaotic days of the Major administration, and possibly since 1990, the year the party hacked down Margaret Thatcher in an orgy of political regicide prompted, naturally, by DNA-deep divisions over Europe.A surely impossible demand from any senior Conservative for David Cameron to accept his manifesto pledge to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is valueless on the ground it's ""corrosive of public trust"" - in other words because no-one believes it - would be embarrassing enough if delivered in private.Published in an open letter by Michael Gove, and Boris Johnson (Gisela Stuart's a co-signatory, but Labour's internal debate is another story) it amounts to an escalation of a battle that now defies all established principles of government discipline and collective responsibility.And it does so in a way the prime minister will surely find very difficult to forgive.The Brexiteers point is that EU open borders make immigration control impossible.It's effect, though, is to accelerate a descent into internecine warfare which now threatens to make the Conservatives ungovernable if the referendum ends in anything but a decisive victory for the remain campaign.So bitter has the conflict become, so taut the tension between the rival factions, that angry Eurosceptic Tories talk privately of challenging the prime minister's position even of Britain votes to stay inside the European Union.One of the most militant Conservative MPs, Andrew Bridgen, has gone public.He told me in an interview for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that he believes it ""highly likely"" at least 50 Tory MPs would sign demands for a vote of no confidence in the PM if the campaign goes on as it has.More than that, he suggests the Cameron administration could be reduced to what he and others call a ""zombie government"" by its divided MPs, unable to govern and forced to consider a snap election.At Westminster, that kind of apocalyptic talk is becoming more common.Some of the whispering is - and is probably intended to be - hair-raising.I've heard it suggested that three ministers have become so upset by the tone of campaigning on the Remain side led by the prime minister that they are contemplating resigning, not just from the government, but from the Tory whip, effectively quitting the party.One MP, on the now militant Eurosceptic wing, said letters demanding a vote of confidence in the PM had already been submitted to the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, who's a sort of posh shop-steward for Conservative MPs.Mr Graham himself is bound by a sacred oath of secrecy where such matters are concerned, so we must wait to find out.The Sunday Times newspaper carries more mutinous muttering.Former Environment Secretary, Owen Patterson, told the paper: ""The government now has four weeks to behave properly. If they don't, there are risks they will cause long term damage to the Conservative Party.""Another, unnamed MP, puts it more bluntly: ""When you tell Tories they are immoral for supporting Brexiteers you are going to get a kick in the nuts.""We'll see, of course. Everything depends on which side wins the referendum, and perhaps on the margin of victory.Mr Cameron insists he would carry on as prime minister if Britain votes to leave the EU.The more common view, shared among his closest supporters, is that he would be toast.Even a vote to remain, could be a Pyrrhic victory, if the margin is tight.Until we know the outcome on Friday 24 June, this self-destructive struggle is likely to intensify before it calms again - assuming, of course, the party is not already broken beyond repair."
2016-05-28,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."

The Treasury Select Committee has criticised both sides in the EU Referendum campaign for peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"".Its chair, Andrew Tyrie, told BBC News: ""What we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides.""The Reality Check team has been keeping an eye on how both sides have been using numbers throughout the campaign. Here are a few from each side.Andrew Tyrie cited the claim that the UK sends £350m a week to Brussels and it could be spent on the NHS instead as particularly problematic. The claim ignores the rebate, which means that amount of money is not sent to Brussels each week. Also, some of the money is returned to the UK to be spent on things like farming subsidies and regional development, and Leave campaigners have not suggested these payments should stop.The claim, which appears on the Vote Leave bus, has also been criticised repeatedly by the UK Statistics Authority. Its chair, Sir Andrew Dilnot, said on Friday he was ""disappointed"" the figure was still being used.You can read the full Reality Check on the £350m claim here. And there is a discussion of why all the money could not be spent on the NHS here.Another claim criticised was the government's suggestion that leaving the EU could cost your family £4,300.The committee pointed out that this was confusing GDP per household with household income and expressed disappointment that so much emphasis had been placed on this figure.You can read Reality Check's take on the £4,300 claim here.The committee's report also said: ""It is misleading to claim, as some campaign groups continue to do, that three million jobs are dependent on EU membership.The Reality Check team covered the Prime Minister saying this, and also David Milliband using a variation on it.You can read about Mr Milliband's assertion that 100,000 jobs in the North East are dependent on the EU here.The committee criticised the claim that the Common Agricultural Policy costs £400 per household per year as being based on out-of-date research. It also questioned how much of that money could be saved by leaving the EU.You'll find discussion of the figure as part of this selection of claims made by Boris Johnson.The committee criticised the Treasury's failure to get its analysis on the short-term consequences of leaving the EU to it in time to include it as part of the report.It described the delays as ""highly unsatisfactory"" and inconsistent with commitments made to the committee by the Chancellor.You can read the Reality Check assessment of the year-long recession claim made by the Treasury here.The Vote Leave claim that the cost of EU regulations was £33.3bn a year or £600m a week was described in the report as a ""tendentious representation of the research on which it is based"".The figure, which came from Open Europe, was an assessment of the cost of complying with the 100 most ""burdensome"" regulations.You can read more about the £600m claim on regulation here.Andrew Tyrie told BBC News that the report had been accepted unanimously by the committee, despite it containing prominent figures from both sides of the debate.""This is unanimous - they accepted what's in the report,"" he said.

The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman.

We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be.

2016-05-28,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378586,"The question: Simon asks BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Would withdrawal from the EU mean that more British footballers had a chance to play in the Premier League, and would those European-sourced players no longer have free access to appear in English teams?""Reality Check verdict: This depends on whether home clubs decide to bring in more top level international players or give opportunities to British footballers. At the moment, EU players have the freedom to participate in British football, while non-EU players have to have a work permit in order to play in the Premier League. We don't know what deal would be cut in the event of Brexit, but we can look at the situation for non-EU players at the moment as an indication of the direction things might take. For non-EU players to be granted a work permit, they must demonstrate they are an international player of ""the highest calibre."" This means they must have played in 75% of a Fifa top-50 ranked national team's matches over the previous two years.The Home Office made it harder for non-EU players to get work visas last year, a move which the FA (Football Association) hoped would give more opportunities for home-grown talent to rise to the top.FA chairman Greg Dyke said at the time that if the new system had been applied over the previous five years, there would have been 42 fewer non-European players in the Premier and Football Leagues. If this kind of reduction was replicated for EU players following a British exit, this would leave vacancies on British teams. Indeed, the BBC's Matt Slater has suggested only 23 of the 180 non-British EU players currently playing in the Championship would get work permits. In theory, those 157 remaining spots could be filled by British players.But clubs would still be able to recruit the best players from around the world. A 2014 FA report suggested while Spanish, French and German players featured heavily in Champions League games, Brazilian players were also a major source of competition, with more than twice as many as English players appearing in any Champions League group stage games in 2013. Vacancies left by ""non-elite"" EU players could be filled by Brits, or they could be filled or by other, more elite international players. Whether home clubs would focus their attentions on attracting the top international players who would remain eligible for work permits, or on giving opportunities to British footballers following a Brexit is likely to depend on factors unrelated to the EU - such as the quality of coaching and the strength of the British talent pool.

2016-05-28,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529034630/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

The government is aiming to cut this figure to under 100,000.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high, and 188,000 for non-EU.In response to the letter, Number 10 said: ""This is a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that the overwhelming majority of economists and businesses believe leaving the single market would be disastrous for jobs, prices and opportunities for people.""Nine in 10 of the UK's top economists agree that leaving the EU would damage the country's economy, according to a survey published in the Observer.According to an IPSOS Mori poll of more than 600 economists, 88% of those who replied said leaving the EU single market would damage Britain's growth prospects over the next five years.Britain Stronger in Europe campaign director Will Straw said: ""This is the final nail in the coffin of the Leave campaign's economic credibility.""It is becoming clear that leaving is a risk we simply cannot afford to take.""It comes as former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major criticised the Vote Leave campaign in the Mail on Sunday.He wrote: ""As the referendum vote comes nearer, I again ask the senior figures of Vote Leave to correct the inaccuracies and falsehoods they are peddling to the British people.""On the issue of immigration from Europe, he said the Leave campaign ""seems more focused on raising fears than setting out facts"".""Their cavalier exaggeration of likely immigration flows has been the most distasteful aspect of this referendum campaign,"" he said.""Vote Leave has consistently failed to tell us how they see the UK outside Europe.

They took control of Sanaa in 2014.A coalition of Arab air forces, led by Saudi Arabia, began carrying out air strikes on the rebels in March 2015, saying it was ""defending the legitimate government"" of Mr Hadi.

But it's a big challenge for the centre... It would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policy-making, left or right.""He added: ""I do think the centre ground needs to work out how it recovers... gets its mojo back and gets the initiative back in the political debate, because... these guys aren't providing answers, not on the economy, not on foreign policy.""John McDonnell, shadow chancellor and close ally of Mr Corbyn dismissed Mr Blair's comments.""I find that a bit rich from a prime minister who took us into the Iraq war which resulted in half a million deaths. So I think it's inappropriate for him to comment and I look forward to the Chilcot report,"" he said.Sir John Chilcot's long-awaited report into how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath, is to be published on 6 July.Ahead of its publication, Mr Blair told This Week's World: ""I have a real humility about the decisions that I took and the issues around them.""I was trying to deal with this in the aftermath of 9/11 and it was very tough - it was very difficult.""The former PM, who set up a foundation which works to promote greater understanding between the world's religions and to challenge extremism and prejudice, said the West was not to blame for the situation in the Middle East.And he warned of bigger terrorist attacks on Europe in future.""You've got to open your eyes to the problem. If we don't do that we're going to store up an even bigger problem for ourselves, and we face the problem in Europe, I'm afraid, of even bigger terror attacks.""I think we need to be in no doubt at all about the people we're dealing with here. If they could kill larger numbers of people that's what they would do,"" he said.The threat, he said, was ""different... from anything we have faced before"" and he said it required a ""different type of policy response and... a different rhythm of thinking"", as it would be a ""generation fight, it's not a fight that's going to be resolved in one year, two years, or even 10"".Mr Blair also called for action to redress the widespread problem of indoctrination of Muslim children in extremist ideologies across the Middle East. He said there needed to be a global commitment, where countries promoted cultural tolerance and rooted out cultural prejudice within their education systems.""If you end up polluting the mind of your people as they're growing up within your country, in today's world where the boundaries come down where there is much more migration and integration, then that is not just for your country - it's a problem for all of us.""

2016-05-29,Miliband 'call to arms' for young voters,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36403826,"Former Labour leader Ed Miliband has issued a ""call to arms"", urging young people to register to vote in next month's EU referendum.The absence of millions of young voters from the electoral register could lead to a victory for the Leave camp in the EU referendum, he warned. Mr Miliband said their ""optimistic generation"" can keep Britain in the EU.But Leave campaigner, Conservative MP James Cleverly, said Mr Miliband's ""cynical"" comments would ""fool no-one"". Mr Miliband said in a speech in London on Saturday that 1.5 million of the six million 18-24 year olds eligible to vote are not registered, nor are a quarter of the eight million 25-35 year olds.They have until 7 June to register to vote in the UK's referendum on its membership of the EU, which takes place on 23 June. Mr Miliband said: ""Today is a call to arms to all young people to register to vote. ""Let's be clear about the danger - a decision not to vote is a decision to let someone else decide your future.""Young people can decide this referendum. If they don't use their vote, the danger is this referendum will be lost.""The UK's EU vote: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guide: Explore the argumentsMr Miliband, who resigned as leader of the Labour Party following its defeat in the 2015 general election, said the Leave side offered a ""narrow"" future which pretended to be about national freedom.He added: ""When the Leave campaign is asked about the future - future jobs, future opportunities, future growth - they have one answer: they just don't know.""Those words should ring in the ears of every child, student and parent. Not knowing is not a path to prosperity, not knowing is the road to recession.""Mr Miliband also told BBC Breakfast that polls suggested younger people were more likely to vote to remain in the EU by three to one, and that older people should ""heed the wisdom of the young"".He added: ""All round the world young people are kicking against the establishment, and yet young people want to back Remain. ""That shows Remain is a future-orientated, positive, optimistic idea, because I think young people take for granted that we've got to work with other countries, and not isolate ourselves.""Mr Cleverly said Mr Miliband's ""cynical"" attempt to reach young people ""will fool no-one"". ""After his failed efforts to court the youth vote via Russell Brand last year, you'd think he would know better.""He also told the BBC that he ""absolutely"" wanted young people to vote in the referendum.""When I talk to young people, actually I find that they are very concerned about the costs of EU membership, about how it limits our ability to trade with the developing world, and how it impinges on our democracy.""Meanwhile, pro-Brexit employment minister Priti Patel launched an attack on the economic predictions of her government colleagues in the Treasury.While out campaigning she told the BBC its forecasts have ""been questioned heavily"" and that Vote Leave was ""making the positive economic case as to why we should leave the European Union"".""Of course we can take back control of the money we send to Europe and spend that growing our economic base and invest that in our economic prosperity in future,"" she said.And despite their increasingly personalised battle, David Cameron indicated he still regards Leave campaigner Boris Johnson as a ""substantial"" potential future successor.Mr Cameron said he would not reconsider comments he made that Mr Johnson, George Osborne and Theresa May were all figures who could step into his shoes when he steps down, which he has promised to do before the next general election."
2016-05-29,Davies blames EU splits for Tory losses,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36399445,"Lack of unity on the EU, UK government challenges and UKIP all contributed to the Welsh Conservatives losing seats at the assembly elections, leader Andrew RT Davies has said.He has spoken for the first time why he feels they lost ground at the election.The Tories lost three seats and Plaid Cymru became the main opposition to Labour, who fell short of a majority.Mr Davies said his vision for a ""one nation Conservative Wales"" had been put ""on hold for another five years"".Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Davies argued his party will need to do more to strengthen perceptions of what makes its brand ""uniquely Welsh"".""We must now roll up our sleeves,"" he said.The Tories lost three assembly seats finishing with 11 and was overtaken by Plaid Cymru who gained one seat to come to a total of 12.UKIP gained seven seats in the Welsh Assembly for the first time. Outlining his reasons, Mr Davies said UKIP candidates were able to ""deftly muddy much of the pre-election debate with talk of non-devolved issues such as immigration and the EU referendum, which undoubtedly resonated with many voters who went on to award them their second vote on the ballot paper"".He added: ""Others have pointed to the effect of the referendum on party unity.""With so many senior figures nailing their colours to opposite sides of the mast, one can only wonder at the effect this had on our Conservative message.""Mr Davies had himself made clear in February that he would be voting for Britain to leave the EU.""I felt I had no choice but to do the honest thing by declaring publicly my personal position on what remains the biggest constitutional question we have faced in a generation,"" he said.He went on to write about devolved matters which he said were further overshadowed in the form of a ""flurry of highly-publicised challenges confronting the UK government during the assembly election period"".""A turbulent climate for our colleagues in London fast became our turbulent climate,"" said Mr Davies.How much of a distraction this would be became apparent during Mr Davies' BBC Ask the Leader debate in Swansea. ""For 30 minutes I fielded questions from an audience mostly concerned with issues beyond the control of our devolved legislature,"" he said.""This at a time when I should have been pitching my party's plans for a better health service and education system for Wales.""Mr Davies also said it ""cannot and must not be ignored that as a party we need to do more to strengthen voter perception of what makes our brand of conservatism uniquely Welsh, and not allow ourselves to be constrained by Westminster or vulnerable to events across the border"".He added: ""We must no longer be content to barrack from the side-lines like armchair generals. ""We must now roll up our sleeves, go back to the drawing board and develop progressive one nation solutions to the issues that matter most to Wales."" The leader said it was worth noting that ""unlike Labour, Welsh Conservatives held on to all its constituency seats and took a greater share of the constituency vote than Plaid Cymru, despite suffering regional losses"".With Prime Minister David Cameron not wanting to carry on for a third term Mr Davies said, whatever the outcome of the referendum, 23 June ""will set in motion the search for a new UK Conservative leader, who possesses the qualities to unite the party on all fronts and move us forward as a family unit, and back the progressive, distinguishable, vote-winning brand of Celtic conservatism""."
2016-05-29,Vote Leave launches £50m football contest,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36397725,"The campaign to get Britain out of the EU has launched a contest to win £50m - if you can correctly predict the result of all 51 games in the Euro 2016 football championships.If no one manages that then there is a £50,000 prize for the person who gets the most consecutive games correct.Vote Leave has taken out an insurance policy to fund the contest.But Britain Stronger In Europe say it is a ""con"" - with the odds of winning a sextillion to one.The £50m represents the amount Vote Leave says Britain sends to the EU a day, a claim disputed by its critics.The argument that Britain sends £350m a week to the EU has proved controversial because it does not take into account the rebate that the UK gets on its payments to the EU.A Vote Leave source said the football contest could be a ""game changer"" for the campaign because it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.Anyone entering will have to rate themselves on a scale of one to five as to whether they are more likely to back continued membership of the EU.The campaign admits that the chances of winning the top prize are slim - but says it is ""worth a punt"".But Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, said the long odds were the same as those for Vote Leave ""coming up with a coherent vision for what life would look like outside the EU"". He added: ""Once again Vote Leave put wild guesswork at the heart of their campaign and it is the British people who they are asking to take the risk.""Hosts France take on Romania in the first game of Euro 2016 on 10 June, with England and Wales in action the following day.Vote Leave's campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""This is the chance of a lifetime - just imagine what you could do with the £50m we send to the EU every single day. ""We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP.""You are staggeringly unlikely to win this competition.There are 36 games in the group stages of the tournament, when there could be a victory for either side or a draw.Then there are 15 knockout games, which cannot be drawn.The odds of picking all 51 games randomly are one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is a bit better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street.Now, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages, which may go down to goal difference or even goals scored.The competition is a based on a similar contest in the US, run by billionaire Warren Buffett, one of the world's richest men, involving the annual men's NCAA basketball tournament known as March Madness.Vote Leave says the contest is free to enter and is open to anyone who is over the age of 18 who is registered to vote in the EU referendum. Entrants must supply their telephone number, email address and home address to qualify for the prize.Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to ""opt out"" from receiving campaign information ""at any time"".A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said any money spent on the contest would have to be reported by the campaign, but added: ""Vote Leave indicate that the £50m prize would be paid by an insurance company and not by them.""The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has again rebuked Vote Leave over its £350m a week claim.In a statement on the authority's website, Sir Andrew Dilnot said that he was ""disappointed"" that the campaign group continued to claim the full amount could be spent in the UK, saying it ""undermined trust in official statistics""."

Mr Johnson has previously said voters want proper debate and to hear about the issues, ""not personal attacks"".The UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The Conservative Party is deeply split over the the issue, with David Cameron and most of his cabinet campaigning for a Remain vote but about half of the MPs supporting an EU exit.The debate inside the party has turned increasingly acrimonious, with former deputy prime minister and pro-Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine recently accusing Mr Johnson of losing his judgement over the EU.Lord Patten, Tory party chairman from 1990 to 1992, added to that criticism of the former London mayor, in an interview with Newsnight's David Grossman on Friday.""Boris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that,"" he said.""There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar. I think he's one of those people in life who simply doesn't really understand the difference between fact and fiction.""He added: ""If he can make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it - and he doesn't think about it.""He'll be saying the opposite in a few months' time.""Lord Patten, a European commissioner from 2000 to 2004, said Mr Johnson was an ""amiable"" character, but added: ""Boris is Boris. Tommy Cooper was Tommy Cooper.""In response, Vote Leave said: ""It's sad to see the level of debate the 'Remainers' have been reduced to. They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now.""And speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's ""anger is almost certainly synthetic"".The MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to ""bash down"" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was ""hugely popular and trusted"" and was making the case for an EU exit ""exceptionally effectively"".The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that ""senior party figures"" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign.On the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be ""very difficult"" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader.""Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU?""I don't know,"" he said.Lord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together.But he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health.""That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,"" he said.Lord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be ""to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote"", which , he said, was ""extraordinary"".And he added: ""I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum.""Also in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro.""I put my hand up,"" he said. ""Everybody occasionally makes a mistake and I think I was wrong about that."""
2016-05-29,EU campaigns 'misleading voters',https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36397732,"Both sides in the EU referendum campaign have been accused of peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"" by a committee of MPs.The Treasury Select Committee calls Vote Leave's claim that Brexit would save £350m a week ""deeply problematic"".And it says Remain's claims families would be worse off by £4,300 a year if Britain quit the EU were ""mistaken"" and had ""probably confused"" voters.The rival groups are failing to inform the public, the MPs say.Vote Leave's £350m-a-week claim - repeated again today - does not take into account Britain's rebate and payments that flow back to the UK, the committee, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, says.""Vote Leave's persistence with it is deeply problematic,"" the report says.""It sits very awkwardly with its promises to the Electoral Commission to work in a spirit that reflects its 'very significant responsibility' and the 'gravity of the choice facing the British people'."" The committee criticised Chancellor George Osborne over his claim that a Treasury analysis showed that ""families would be £4,300 worse off"" if Britain left the EU.""This is not what the main Treasury analysis found - the average impact on household disposable incomes would be considerably smaller than this number, which refers to the impact on GDP per household,"" the report said.""It may have left many readers thinking that the figures refer to the effect of leaving the EU on household disposable income, which they do not,"" the report added.The report said government departments and Remain campaigners should not repeat this ""mistaken assertion,"" adding: ""To persist with this claim would be to misrepresent the Treasury's own work.""The Claim: The two sides in the EU referendum campaign have been accused of peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"" by a committee of MPs.Reality Check verdict: There is growing acceptance that both sides could be clearer about the figures they're using to support their arguments.Read more hereThe committee also finds that it is misleading to claim that three million jobs are dependent on Britain's membership of the EU. ""Without an estimate of how much trade would be lost as a result of Brexit, the impact on job losses cannot readily be estimated,"" it said.""The wider public might form the mistaken impression that all these jobs would be lost or at risk if the UK left the EU. ""Campaigners should be clear that three million jobs may be associated with, but would not necessarily be dependent on, our membership of the EU.""Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Vote Leave's £350m claim was ""by far the most serious claim out there"" which was ""simply not true"". ""But what we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter claims made by both sides on this.""I think it's confusing the public, it's impoverishing political debate... the public are thoroughly fed up with it.""The report also singled out for criticism the behaviour of Vote Leave campaigners Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings, whose treatment of the committee was described as ""appalling"". And the cross-party committee claimed it was ""highly unsatisfactory"" it had been was unable to scrutinise the government's analysis of the short-term impact of Brexit in time to include it in the report.The report says: ""It is to be hoped that scrutiny and transparency have not, in this case, been subordinated to the imperatives of the Number 10 'media grid'.""For Britain Stronger In Europe, Labour MP Wes Streeting said: ""The committee's report has confirmed everyone's suspicions about Vote Leave - that they are a bunch of charlatans who mislead the British people and treat parliamentary democracy with contempt."" He said the ""case is now closed"" on the economy: ""Every expert accepts that leaving would result in an economic shock."" But for Vote Leave, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the committee, said the report ""shows that David Cameron's renegotiation fell short of the ambitions expressed in his Bloomberg speech of January 2013"" and that the Remain campaign had used misleading claims.'Most shockingly the chancellor, George Osborne, has consistently used a figure that he ought to have known would have been misunderstood and has misrepresented the Treasury's own analysis to do so."" The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has again rebuked Vote Leave over the £350m claim. Sir Andrew Dilnot said that he was ""disappointed"" the group continued to claim the full amount could be spent in the UK, saying it ""undermined trust in official statistics""."
2016-05-29,Salmond urged to quit EU campaign,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36399716,"Alex Salmond has been urged to quit the campaign to keep the UK in Europe ""before he does any more damage"".Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie made the plea as he warned that the former first minister was ""undermining"" the remain campaign. In a TV debate, Mr Salmond said Scotland could vote for independence within two years of a UK Brexit vote.A SNP spokesman said the former party leader made an ""outstanding"" case for the UK's continued EU membership.During the debate, the MP for Gordon said: ""If you had the situation where Scotland in four weeks' time votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""Such a vote ""would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw"", he stated.While polls across the UK suggest a tight contest between the leave and remain campaigns in the run-up to the June 23 European referendum, research in Scotland suggests a clear majority in favour of staying in the EU.Mr Rennie accused the former first minister of ""behaving like a not-so-secret agent for the leave campaign"" by focusing on Scottish independence, adding that his comments made a vote to leave more likely.He said: ""He spends more time rubbishing the official remain campaign and promoting Scottish independence than making the positive case to remain in Europe.""MSPs at Holyrood overwhelmingly backed a Scottish government motion on Thursday, making clear their support for Scotland and the UK remaining part of the EU.Mr Rennie added: ""This week in parliament, MSPs from all parties made the clear, passionate, positive case for Scotland remaining part of the EU.""But Alex Salmond seems more interested in using the Europe poll to advance the cause of Scottish independence than actively working to keep us in the EU.""Too many senior figures in the SNP are approaching this 2016 referendum with a 2014 mind-set. Alex Salmond is a serial offender.""His threats about another independence vote may encourage his supporters to back Brexit. His attacks on the remain campaign are undermining it and risking Brexit.""On both counts he is risking our place in the European Union, not supporting it. Alex Salmond should opt out of the campaign before he does any more damage.""A spokesman for the SNP said Mr Salmond made an ""outstanding and overwhelming case"" for Scotland and the UK's continued membership of the EU. ""His passionate arguments on the benefits of EU membership on migration, on employment opportunities for younger people and on the wider benefits of membership to our economy were well received by the audience of young people, including when answering a specific question from an audience member about Scottish independence,"" he said. ""Willie Rennie needs to make up his mind quickly what his top priority is - attacking the SNP over everything and anything, or joining our efforts to keep Scotland in Europe.""Meanwhile, Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been in Scotland campaigning for a Leave vote.Mr Farage spoke at a Fishing for Leave conference in Aberdeen, alongside UK government Marine Environment Minister George Eustice.The MEP urged fishermen to ""take back our birthright"" by voting to leave the EU, insisting ""our grandparents didn't fight two world wars...so that we should have to go to Brussels to beg for crumbs from the table.""He also said the UK has ""literally given away our country"" and urged British citizens to fight for their ""birthright""; to ""have the whip hand"" in future negotiations with Europe."

One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - ""agree wholeheartedly"" with the need for ""diversity"" in agency staff.It says action has been taken since the report was published to ""increase their focus"" on ""all aspects of diversity"", including recruiting more women.Recruitment targets, ""diversity champions"", events such as a recent ""Women in Cyber"" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion.They also say they are doing more to ""promote a flexible working culture"" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles.The three agencies also said they were always looking for ""new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach"".MI5 had already used Mumsnet as well as local newspapers to target women ""not currently in work"" while the other two agencies did so for the first time this year.GCHQ has also removed a requirement of a 2:1 university degree from its ""fast-stream"" recruitment to encourage women who had followed a ""non-traditional graduate route"".The government said the initiatives were having an effect as MI5 had recently been placed in the Times Top 50 employers for women and had increased its number of new female employees by 5% to 46% of new recruits. GCHQ had seen applications from women rise to 40%. MI6 had increased its female recruitment targets for 2016/17 after seeing a 4% drop in women - to 41% of new recruits.The government also said career support for female staff was having a ""real impact"" with increased numbers of women applying for senior roles in MI5."

I have pretty much had the same view about Europe ever since I got involved in active politics,"" the PM said.Boris Johnson told him it was ""not too late"" to join the Leave campaign.With four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June about whether to leave the European Union, there have been reports that Conservative PM Mr Cameron, at heart,  backs ""Brexit,"" as a British exit from the EU is known.Steve Hilton, who was one of Mr Cameron's closest aides before leaving Downing Street in 2012 and who worked alongside him when they were both Tory researchers, told the Times on Thursday: ""If he was a member of the public, or a backbench MP or a junior minister or even a cabinet minister, I'm certain that he would be for Leave. ""That's his whole instinct. That's who he is. As prime minister he sees it from a different perspective and that's perfectly reasonable ... but I think that if he didn't have that perspective, he would be for Leave.""But Mr Cameron, who has described himself as a Eurosceptic, said at the close of the G7 summit:  ""I am not a closet anything. I have pretty much had the same view about Europe ever since I got involved in active politics.""I have always taken the same view, which is that we are better off in this organisation but we should be aiming to reform this organisation, we should be looking to enhance the special status that Britain.""I have never been a closet Brexiteer. I am absolutely passionate about getting the right result, getting this reform in Europe and remaining part of it. It's in Britain's national interest.""He pointed to a joint declaration by the leaders of the G7 countries - the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada - at the end of the two-day Ise-Shima summit, which stated: ""UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend toward greater global trade, investment and the jobs they create and is a further serious risk to growth"".""When you are faced with a difficult decision, it is often a good thing to listen to what your friends think,"" the prime minister said.In an interview with BBC South political editor Peter Henley, one of the most senior Conservatives in the Vote Leave campaign, Boris Johnson noted Mr Hilton's comments and said it was ""not too late"".Asked if he was suggesting Mr Cameron should join him in campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, the former London mayor added: ""Yes. There is more joy in Heaven over one that repenteth. Now is the time. There's a month to go.""He added: ""He has been a believer in democracy and over 20 years or so he has been a strong Eurosceptic.""Mr Cameron, in turn, told LBC radio last week that Mr Johnson had ""told a lot of people that he'd never been a Leaver"" - Mr Johnson responded that he had ""been a Eurosceptic for decades"".The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that ""senior party figures"" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign."

2016-05-29,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-29,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-29,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36392341,"The claim: Migration to the UK is out of control and will get worse if Britain remains in the EU. Reality Check verdict: Net migration is still at near-record levels. Just over half of it comes from outside the EU. The government has not managed to bring migration from outside the EU down to tens of thousands as the 2010 and 2015 manifestos promised, so it is not clear it would be able to do so with EU migrants post-Brexit.A lot of people are migrating to the UK, and fewer people are leaving. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures on long-term migration every three months, and these basic facts haven't changed for years. Overall net migration stands at 333,000, and has risen more than a third since David Cameron came to power in 2010, with the aim of reducing numbers to tens of thousands a year.If you exclude Brits from the figures, things look even worse for the government's targets. Last year, 373,000 more non-Brits came to live in the UK than left, a 45% increase on 2010.With the referendum fast approaching, campaigners such as Nigel Farage say that immigration can only be brought back down to the tens of thousands if we leave the EU. While the UK can decide which immigrants it accepts from outside the EU, almost anyone from within the EU is entitled to come and live here. While the rest of the EU accounts for about 6% of the world's population, it's now the source of about 49% of UK net migration. That's up from 29% five years earlier, mainly because non-EU migration has steadied off, while EU migration has increased. It may be that the accession of new EU members has fuelled that rise. Home Secretary Theresa May said last month that the EU's free movement rules make controlling immigration ""harder"". But would leaving the EU really mean immigration came crashing down? In theory, the UK could put a block on any more EU citizens coming to live here, and that could cut the net migration figures in half at a stroke. But if that were going to happen to EU migrants, why hasn't it already happened to non-EU migrants? The UK isn't bound to accept them by any international treaties, but nevertheless let 277,000 of them move over last year alone. Three quarters of immigrants move to the UK for work or study, and the ratio is much the same for EU migrants. According to figures from Oxford University, nearly 60% of EU migrants coming over for work have got a job lined up before they arrive.Also, it is possible that a deal to retain access to the single market would require the UK to maintain freedom of movement for EU citizens wanting to come here to work.Unemployment rates have been falling more or less constantly for the past five years, and if the economy remains healthy the UK is likely to need just as many workers in future.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-29,John Pienaar,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/36407446,"Anyone who's followed politics for any length of time knows no party's more prone to suicidal bouts of indiscipline than the Labour Party.Unless, of course, it's the Conservative Party when it's in the mood.Just now, the Tories are in more of a mood than they've been since the chaotic days of the Major administration, and possibly since 1990, the year the party hacked down Margaret Thatcher in an orgy of political regicide prompted, naturally, by DNA-deep divisions over Europe.A surely impossible demand from any senior Conservative for David Cameron to accept his manifesto pledge to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is valueless on the ground it's ""corrosive of public trust"" - in other words because no-one believes it - would be embarrassing enough if delivered in private.Published in an open letter by Michael Gove, and Boris Johnson (Gisela Stuart's a co-signatory, but Labour's internal debate is another story) it amounts to an escalation of a battle that now defies all established principles of government discipline and collective responsibility.And it does so in a way the prime minister will surely find very difficult to forgive.The Brexiteers point is that EU open borders make immigration control impossible.It's effect, though, is to accelerate a descent into internecine warfare which now threatens to make the Conservatives ungovernable if the referendum ends in anything but a decisive victory for the remain campaign.So bitter has the conflict become, so taut the tension between the rival factions, that angry Eurosceptic Tories talk privately of challenging the prime minister's position even of Britain votes to stay inside the European Union.One of the most militant Conservative MPs, Andrew Bridgen, has gone public.He told me in an interview for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that he believes it ""highly likely"" at least 50 Tory MPs would sign demands for a vote of no confidence in the PM if the campaign goes on as it has.More than that, he suggests the Cameron administration could be reduced to what he and others call a ""zombie government"" by its divided MPs, unable to govern and forced to consider a snap election.At Westminster, that kind of apocalyptic talk is becoming more common.Some of the whispering is - and is probably intended to be - hair-raising.I've heard it suggested that three ministers have become so upset by the tone of campaigning on the Remain side led by the prime minister that they are contemplating resigning, not just from the government, but from the Tory whip, effectively quitting the party.One MP, on the now militant Eurosceptic wing, said letters demanding a vote of confidence in the PM had already been submitted to the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, who's a sort of posh shop-steward for Conservative MPs.Mr Graham himself is bound by a sacred oath of secrecy where such matters are concerned, so we must wait to find out.The Sunday Times newspaper carries more mutinous muttering.Former Environment Secretary, Owen Patterson, told the paper: ""The government now has four weeks to behave properly. If they don't, there are risks they will cause long term damage to the Conservative Party.""Another, unnamed MP, puts it more bluntly: ""When you tell Tories they are immoral for supporting Brexiteers you are going to get a kick in the nuts.""We'll see, of course. Everything depends on which side wins the referendum, and perhaps on the margin of victory.Mr Cameron insists he would carry on as prime minister if Britain votes to leave the EU.The more common view, shared among his closest supporters, is that he would be toast.Even a vote to remain, could be a Pyrrhic victory, if the margin is tight.Until we know the outcome on Friday 24 June, this self-destructive struggle is likely to intensify before it calms again - assuming, of course, the party is not already broken beyond repair."
2016-05-29,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."

The Treasury Select Committee has criticised both sides in the EU Referendum campaign for peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"".Its chair, Andrew Tyrie, told BBC News: ""What we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides.""The Reality Check team has been keeping an eye on how both sides have been using numbers throughout the campaign. Here are a few from each side.Andrew Tyrie cited the claim that the UK sends £350m a week to Brussels and it could be spent on the NHS instead as particularly problematic. The claim ignores the rebate, which means that amount of money is not sent to Brussels each week. Also, some of the money is returned to the UK to be spent on things like farming subsidies and regional development, and Leave campaigners have not suggested these payments should stop.The claim, which appears on the Vote Leave bus, has also been criticised repeatedly by the UK Statistics Authority. Its chair, Sir Andrew Dilnot, said on Friday he was ""disappointed"" the figure was still being used.You can read the full Reality Check on the £350m claim here. And there is a discussion of why all the money could not be spent on the NHS here.Another claim criticised was the government's suggestion that leaving the EU could cost your family £4,300.The committee pointed out that this was confusing GDP per household with household income and expressed disappointment that so much emphasis had been placed on this figure.You can read Reality Check's take on the £4,300 claim here.The committee's report also said: ""It is misleading to claim, as some campaign groups continue to do, that three million jobs are dependent on EU membership.The Reality Check team covered the Prime Minister saying this, and also David Milliband using a variation on it.You can read about Mr Milliband's assertion that 100,000 jobs in the North East are dependent on the EU here.The committee criticised the claim that the Common Agricultural Policy costs £400 per household per year as being based on out-of-date research. It also questioned how much of that money could be saved by leaving the EU.You'll find discussion of the figure as part of this selection of claims made by Boris Johnson.The committee criticised the Treasury's failure to get its analysis on the short-term consequences of leaving the EU to it in time to include it as part of the report.It described the delays as ""highly unsatisfactory"" and inconsistent with commitments made to the committee by the Chancellor.You can read the Reality Check assessment of the year-long recession claim made by the Treasury here.The Vote Leave claim that the cost of EU regulations was £33.3bn a year or £600m a week was described in the report as a ""tendentious representation of the research on which it is based"".The figure, which came from Open Europe, was an assessment of the cost of complying with the 100 most ""burdensome"" regulations.You can read more about the £600m claim on regulation here.Andrew Tyrie told BBC News that the report had been accepted unanimously by the committee, despite it containing prominent figures from both sides of the debate.""This is unanimous - they accepted what's in the report,"" he said.

2016-05-29,Is it 'workin'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380007,"The battle between the Remain and Leave sides in the EU referendum is in full swing and social media is being used by both camps to try to win the race.Younger voters have so far been slower to register to vote and campaigners are keen to win their attention and support.Some strategies have enjoyed surprise success while others have misfired completely. The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be.

2016-05-29,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378586,"The question: Simon asks BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Would withdrawal from the EU mean that more British footballers had a chance to play in the Premier League, and would those European-sourced players no longer have free access to appear in English teams?""Reality Check verdict: This depends on whether home clubs decide to bring in more top level international players or give opportunities to British footballers. At the moment, EU players have the freedom to participate in British football, while non-EU players have to have a work permit in order to play in the Premier League. We don't know what deal would be cut in the event of Brexit, but we can look at the situation for non-EU players at the moment as an indication of the direction things might take. For non-EU players to be granted a work permit, they must demonstrate they are an international player of ""the highest calibre."" This means they must have played in 75% of a Fifa top-50 ranked national team's matches over the previous two years.The Home Office made it harder for non-EU players to get work visas last year, a move which the FA (Football Association) hoped would give more opportunities for home-grown talent to rise to the top.FA chairman Greg Dyke said at the time that if the new system had been applied over the previous five years, there would have been 42 fewer non-European players in the Premier and Football Leagues. If this kind of reduction was replicated for EU players following a British exit, this would leave vacancies on British teams. Indeed, the BBC's Matt Slater has suggested only 23 of the 180 non-British EU players currently playing in the Championship would get work permits. In theory, those 157 remaining spots could be filled by British players.But clubs would still be able to recruit the best players from around the world. A 2014 FA report suggested while Spanish, French and German players featured heavily in Champions League games, Brazilian players were also a major source of competition, with more than twice as many as English players appearing in any Champions League group stage games in 2013. Vacancies left by ""non-elite"" EU players could be filled by Brits, or they could be filled or by other, more elite international players. Whether home clubs would focus their attentions on attracting the top international players who would remain eligible for work permits, or on giving opportunities to British footballers following a Brexit is likely to depend on factors unrelated to the EU - such as the quality of coaching and the strength of the British talent pool.

2016-05-29,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160529145703/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

They were launching a Britain Stronger In Europe battle bus and pledge card.But Vote Leave said the PM's criticisms of Mr Khan during the mayoral contest less than a month ago showed he could not be trusted.UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said the PM had accused Mr Khan of being a ""terrorist sympathiser"".Mr Cameron repeatedly attacked Mr Khan for having a history of sharing platforms with extremists - a claim firmly rejected by Mr Khan - as part of the Conservatives' failed campaign to get Zac Goldsmith elected to City Hall.At Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons some Labour MPs denounced Mr Cameron as a racist when he questioned Mr Khan's judgment.At the Remain campaign event in London, Mr Cameron appeared to bury the hatchet.He shook hands with Mr Khan and congratulated him on his victory in the mayoral contest, telling the crowd: ""I'm proud to be here with the mayor of London - with the Labour mayor of London - on this vital, vital issue.""He hailed the fact that ""someone who is a proud Muslim, a proud Brit and a proud Londoner can become mayor of the greatest city on Earth. That says something about our country"".The prime minister said he expected many disagreements with the London Mayor but they were both part of ""an incredibly broad campaign"" in favour of EU membership.Mr Cameron described himself as a ""Eurosceptic"" but said the ability to criticise the EU is ""a cause of strength in our campaign... we're levelling with people, something the other side refuses to do"".Mr Khan defended his decision to share a platform with the Conservative prime minister - something Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to do, despite being on the same side as him in the referendum debate.The London mayor said: ""There are many things on which the prime minister and I will disagree. But what's really important is when it's in Londoners' interests for the mayor and the government to work closely together, we will work closely together.""He claimed ""more than half a million jobs"" in London depended on the UK's membership of the EU, adding: ""A vote for Remain means jobs and opportunities."" Staying in the EU meant more measures to fight climate change, ""workers' rights protected and more rights for women,"" he added, and he urged young people to ""get involved"" in the referendum and register to vote.Vote Leave spokesman and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said voters ""should not trust David Cameron"".""Just a month ago he attacked Sadiq Khan as a terrorist sympathiser, yet today he hailed him as a great politician as he stood next to him on a shared platform.""Today he trumpeted the benefits of the European Arrest Warrant but a few years ago he warned that it was dangerous and that it stripped away centuries old rights from the British people.""David Cameron's flip-flops show that he is not a man of principle - he is just desperate to cling on to power"".Mr Cameron and Mr Khan unveiled a ""five point guarantee card"" listing what they say voters will get if they vote to Remain on 23 June. The card promises ""full access"" to the EU single market, protection of workers' rights, ""a safer Britain"" with co-operation with other EU states, the UK keeping its ""special status"" within the EU, outside the euro and the Schengen passport-free area and with an opt-out from the EU's aim of ""ever-closer union"" and ""stability"".Vote Leave hit back with a list of five things they say will happen if Britain votes to remain in the EU.These include much disputed assertion that the UK will continue to ""send £350m a week to Brussels,"" a claim that the free movement of people in the EU will continue ""permanently"" and that Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey join, a warning about business red tape, and a claim that ""we will continue to be unable to remove criminals and terrorists whose presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good"".

The plan to ask job applicants if they went to private school is part of the PM's push to improve ""life chances"".The Cabinet Office said the plan would be voluntary.But Lord Waldegrave, who served under Lady Thatcher and John Major and is now the Crown-appointed head of Eton's governing body, has threatened to quit the Conservative Party if the government pushes ahead with it.He told the Daily Telegraph: ""Fundamentally, I think it quite wrong to punish children for decisions taken by their parents, and to run the risk of choosing crucial public service jobs not on the basis of merit but of social engineering. The ablest candidates come from all possible backgrounds.""I have told the chief whip in the Lords that I do not see how I could continue to accept the whip if I believed that the government was actively seeking to damage the charitable school of which I am a trustee, and the many other schools like it which are meeting the justifiable demands of the Charity Commission to help the wider community.""Eton College, a boys-only boarding school, which also counts former London mayor Boris Johnson among its former pupils, charges £12,354 a term but it says 21% of pupils receive financial support towards their fees through bursaries.David Cameron has frequently defended his privileged background, saying he was fortunate to attend one of Britain's top schools and he wants all children in the UK to have the same chances in life.Other proposals in his ""life chances"" agenda include forcing top universities to publish the proportion of ethnic minority applicants who secure places, and giving more support to children leaving local authority care.Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock is drawing up proposals to allow companies and recruiters to check the ""socio-economic background"" of those applying for jobs.The idea is to be tried out on applicants for Civil Service jobs initially.A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""We are fully committed to increasing social mobility, and building a Civil Service that represents the country that it serves.The proposals we have outlined to measure social background are part of a broad consultation and no legislation is being put forward. ""While voluntary, we are already hugely encouraged by the number of businesses that are grasping this and helping us to shape these measures and therefore enhance social mobility.""Our whole approach is about levelling up, not denying opportunities to anyone. This is about measuring how well we make the most of the talent of everyone in the UK, no matter their background."""
2016-05-30,UK pays £5.5m to defunct defence body,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36411536,"The UK Foreign Office has been spending over £1m a year on an international security alliance that was abolished in 2011, the BBC has discovered. In the past five years the department has paid around £5.5m to the Western European Union, which is now defunct.Critics said it was a waste of taxpayers' money but the Foreign Office says the UK has been pushing to get the WEU fully closed as soon as possible.The payments were revealed by a Freedom of Information request.The BBC's FOI request disclosed that payments have been made to cover residual pension obligations which were not fully financed by arrangements made by the organisation prior to closure, as well into a fund to cover potential shortfalls in wind-up costs and unforeseen legal costs.The Western European Union, established in 1954, was a military alliance of West European states set up to coordinate defence policies against the common Soviet threat at the height of the Cold War. However, after the relaxation of east-west tensions in Europe, most of the organisation's security functions were transferred into the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union.The members of the Western European Union moved to terminate the organisation in March 2010, and the WEU was formally declared defunct in June 2011.The Western European Union was formed by Britain, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in 1948 by the Treaty of Brussels, to defend against the possibility of a renewed threat from Germany.But the Brussels-based organisation was quickly eclipsed by the formation of NATO with the United States, the following year, when attention switched to the threat of attack from the Soviet Union.It nevertheless grew to include 10 European nations, including Germany and Italy.  It was meant to be independent of NATO, with its own chiefs of staff and military command but, in practice, it was little more than a talking shop, which mounted few military operations of its own.It held its final committee meeting in late 2000, when its functions were absorbed into the European Union, as part of moves to create an EU rapid reaction force and common defence policy. It was not formally closed down until 2011.The fact that government money is still being paid towards the organisation has prompted criticism.Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of campaign group the Taxpayers' Alliance said: ""Taxpayers will be scratching their heads as to why they're still paying for a Cold War-era organisation 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. ""Because this organisation continued to exist well past its sell by date, British taxpayers are still picking up a bill for huge pay-offs. ""The government must make every effort to close the book on the WEU and limit taxpayers' liabilities.""Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is campaigning to leave the EU, said:  ""A gravy train seems to have become a ghost train."" The Foreign Office said in a statement: ""While the UK will continue to meet all of its obligations to former WEU employees, our overall objective is to move the WEU towards full closure.""We continue to work with other former member states to address all outstanding legacy issues as quickly and efficiently as possible."""
2016-05-30,Two charged after migrant boat rescue,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36412728,"Two British men have appeared in court charged with immigration offences after a boat carrying 20 people was rescued off the Kent coast on Sunday.Robert Stilwell, 33, from Dartford, and Mark Stribling, 35, from Farningham, appeared at Medway Magistrates Court accused of people smuggling.Those rescued included 18 Albanian migrants, two of them children.An ex-chief immigration inspector said earlier people would die unless more were done to stop crossing attempts.Mr Stilwell and Mr Stribling were charged with conspiring to facilitate the entry of non-EU nationals, and remanded in custody to appear before Maidstone Crown Court on 27 June.The UK coastguard said it was called just before midnight on Saturday to an incident off the coastal village of Dymchurch.Residents: 'It's a bit of a worry'How is the UK-France border policed?Those on board the boat reportedly alerted their families in Calais after their inflatable boat started taking in water.Rescuers said a helicopter from nearby Lydd and two lifeboats from Dungeness and Folkestone were sent to the incident off Dymchurch.At about 02:00 BST on Sunday, a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, known as a ""rhib"", with 20 people on board was found.Trevor Bunney, who was part of the RNLI lifeboat rescue team, said the people they rescued were ""a bit dishevelled, [had] obviously been at sea a long time and not in the best of conditions"". ""One lady had the first signs of hypothermia,"" he said.After being rescued, the group were handed over to the UK Border Force and taken to Dover.A second vessel - which officials say could be linked to the incident - was discovered on the beach at Dymchurch.Since the rescue on Sunday, concerns have been raised that sea tragedies, similar to those seen on the voyage to Turkey, Greece or Italy, could occur in the English Channel.There is an ""equal chance"" of migrants drowning in the Channel as in the Mediterranean, former chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine said.Mr Vine, who was chief inspector until 2014, said: ""We have seen the tragedies that have occurred in the Mediterranean.He added that the hazards of Channel sea traffic, weather and sea conditions ""are going to mean there is an equal chance of people losing their lives unless this is stopped.""""Clearly if this is now the start of something new, then really that needs to be reassessed and resources need to be put in,"" he added.By Simon Jones, BBC correspondentMany people living along the Kent coast are shocked, but not surprised at what's happened. The Channel is a huge stretch of water to patrol - and the authorities are often relying on tip-offs to try to catch those responsible.Some residents are asking how many migrants are managing to get through without being detected. The fear is that with the recent security clampdown at the Port of Calais and Eurotunnel, more and more migrants will attempt to cross the Channel on small boats, putting their lives at risk.At the Port of Dover, the boat from which the migrants were rescued is still being painstakingly examined. It would have been a tight fit to get 20 people on board, crammed into the small craft in the busiest shipping lane in the world.UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said it was ""essential that a clear message is sent that no migrant arriving on our shores by boat is allowed leave to remain"".""We have all seen the horrors of the Mediterranean, with thousands crossing and hundreds dying, we cannot allow that to happen off the shores of Kent and Sussex.""However, Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said it was ""too early to say whether this is a new trend"".He told BBC Radio 5 live it was wrong to say the UK's coastline was ""undefended"", saying the Channel was ""probably the most monitored stretch of water in the world"".Sunday's incident comes after 17 men, thought to be Albanian migrants, were detained when a catamaran arrived at Chichester Marina in West Sussex on Tuesday, along with a 55-year-old British man wanted on suspicion of murder in Spain.The Briton, who was the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, was detained on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration and the 17 men were held on suspicion of entering the UK illegally.Also last month, two Iranian men were found floating in a dinghy in the Channel."

Follow the latest updates on our live pageIn a joint letter to the prime minister, Mr Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove said Mr Cameron's promise to reduce net migration to below 100,000 at last year's general election was ""plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU"".Following the letter, a number of Conservative MPs broke ranks to call for Mr Cameron to quit even if the Remain campaign wins in 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU. Nadine Dorries - a long standing backbench critic of the prime minister who says she would back Mr Johnson in any contest to replace him - predicted the PM would be ""toast"" if Remain won by a narrow margin. She told ITV's Peston on Sunday she had tabled a letter seeking a no-confidence vote in Mr Cameron.Fellow Leave campaigner Andrew Bridgen suggested more than the 50 Conservative MPs needed to trigger such a vote were ready to move against Mr Cameron.In his Today interview, Mr Clarke said Conservative in-fighting was ""damaging to the referendum"". ""The public are getting fed up with Tory civil wars when they thought they were being asked about the future of this country for their children and grandchildren.""All this stuff about whether one or two backbenchers have signed letters calling for David Cameron to resign, I think most of the public would agree, is a bit of a diversion. ""I think Boris and Donald Trump should go away for a bit and enjoy themselves and not get in the way of the serious issues which modern countries of the 21st century face.""Pressed on his opinion of Mr Johnson, he said: ""He is a much nicer version of Donald Trump but the campaign is remarkably similar in my opinion and about as relevant to the real problems that the public face.""Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, who entered Parliament at the 2015 election, said she hoped hostilities between Tory MPs would cease after the referendum.""Of the new intake, the 2015 intake, we're very much hoping that after the referendum we can get back to doing the work we set out to do and that David Cameron as the prime minister will be leading that way,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.Number 10 dismissed the personal attacks as a ""distraction"" intended to move attention away from the economic arguments for remaining in the EU.  Republican candidate Mr Trump sparked controversy by suggesting a temporary ""ban"" on Muslims entering the United States and has pledged to build a wall to prevent Mexican illegal immigrants entering the country."
2016-05-30,EU Commission appointment criticised,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36412098,"A top EU watchdog has strongly criticised the European Commission over the appointment of a special adviser.European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said the appointment of Edmund Stoiber in 2014 was a case of ""maladministration"" because the Commission had bypassed conflict of interest checks.Mr Stoiber, a former prime minister of Bavaria, headed a team that sought to cut the cost of EU regulations. Ms O'Reilly has now widened her inquiry into EU special adviser appointments.The Commission has about 40 such advisers, who have high-level access to EU politicians and often work for other private sector clients, the BBC's Nick Beake reports from Brussels.In December 2014 the Commission failed to make public Mr Stoiber's disclosure that he also held positions with a big insurance company. Commenting on the question of EU transparency in such appointments, Ms O'Reilly said that ""culturally, there is not sufficient acceptance of why this is an issue"". ""I get the sense people don't think it's a big deal. The Commission needs to get a lot more serious. It is not taking it sufficiently seriously.""  The ombudsman investigates allegations of EU maladministration - sometimes made by ordinary citizens. She can call officials to account, but does not have any judicial powers.Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker brought the German politician in because of his experience in cutting bureaucratic costs for small and medium-sized businesses in the EU single market. For seven years he headed an expert High-Level Group advising the 28 member states on efficient ways to implement EU regulations.The Commission says Mr Stoiber's group managed to cut administrative costs for businesses by more than 25%, giving a saving EU-wide of more than €33bn (£25bn; $37bn).Mrs O'Reilly also accused the Commission of an ongoing lack of transparency in its dealings with the tobacco industry. And she said the Eurogroup - the group of eurozone finance ministers - ought to be more open. "
2016-05-30,Sugar tax will 'hit poorest hardest',https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36410589,"The planned sugar tax will ""hit poorest families hardest"" and has nothing to do with the sugar content of products, the Taxpayers' Alliance says.The group, which wants the levy to be axed, tested 49 drinks and found that some coffee shop drinks had more sugar than Coca Cola, but would not be taxed.Anti-obesity campaigners welcomed the tax when it was announced in March.The Treasury said soft drinks would be taxed because they were the main source of added sugar in children's diets.Sugar tax: How will it work?What is the UK's most sugary drink?The Taxpayers' Alliance (TPA) survey found that Coca-Cola, with 10.6g of sugar per 100ml, will be subject to the levy, but a Starbucks signature hot chocolate with whipped cream and coconut milk, which has 11g of sugar per 100ml, will not.The study also noted energy drinks such as Monster Origin, 11g/100ml, will be taxed, but Tesco chocolate flavoured milk, 12.4g/100ml, will not be.Overall, the 10 most sugary drinks analysed by the group which campaigns for lower taxes will not be subject to the levy.The recommended maximum intake of added sugar per day for those aged 11 and over is about 30g or seven teaspoons, the NHS says.TPA chief executive Jonathan Isaby said it was ""deeply concerning"" that the government was ""pushing ahead with this regressive tax which will hit the poorest families hardest"".""The evidence shows that the sugar tax has nothing to do with the sugar content of products, so it is farcical to suggest that this will have any positive impact on people's diet or lifestyle choices,"" he said.""This is yet another example of  irresponsible meddling from the high priests of the nanny state, introducing entirely unnecessary complications into an already complicated tax system and pushing up the cost of everyday products for hard-pressed families.""The NHS has also said it would impose its own ""sugar tax"" in hospitals and health centres in England.Chief executive Simon Stevens said he wanted the 20% tax on all sugary drinks and foods in NHS cafes to be introduced by 2020. It is hoped the NHS levy, which would initially just apply to sugary drinks, could raise £20m-40m a year, with the money raised used to improve the health of its workforce. The ""tax"" would also be put in place with the aim of discouraging staff, patients and visitors from buying sugary goods.  A Treasury spokesman said the soft drinks industry levy was ""a major step forward in our efforts to tackle childhood obesity"".""Treating obesity and its consequences costs the taxpayer £5.1bn every year,"" he said.""The levy will be charged on soft drinks because they are the main source of added sugar in children's and teenagers' diets, many with no intrinsic nutritional value.""Health experts agree there is a specific problem with sugar-laden fizzy drinks that must be addressed.""He said the money from the tax would go towards funding more school sport and expanding school breakfast clubs."

""The WTO would not give the right to provide services,"" he warned. ""At the moment the banking system of Britain provides services all over Europe because by being part of the European Union they have what's called a single passport and they can operate everywhere.""If Britain left the European Union it would not have a single passport and many financial services companies might say 'we can't have our headquarters in a country that is outside the European Union' and they might well move. ""This would be a huge blow to the British economy,"" he told Wake Up to Money.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.The World Trade Organisation told the BBC: ""the WTO does have financial services agreements but not all members are party to it and it is not a case of uniform commitments.""But Mr Lyons, former chief economist at Standard Chartered and a member of Economists for Brexit, a group of eight independent economists that favour leaving the EU, said Mr Sutherland needed to ""look at the reality.""""Some people fear, and it's a misplaced fear, that if London were outside the European Union the City would somehow be affected,"" said Mr Lyons.""London has continued to adapt and change and so too has the financial sector. Increasingly financial regulation is set at a global level.""'Appalling complexity'Mr Sutherland has also warned that manufacturers could be hit if the UK votes to leave the EU, saying they will face more regulation than currently.""If you sell manufactured goods into the European Union under WTO rules, you have to be able to prove - and this means inspections at borders - that the component parts are from Britain.""If, for example, you are exporting cars and the engines are made in another country, that will all have to be checked and different tariff rates might be applicable to some of the components.""You're in a new ball game of appalling complexity and the prospect of that should be extremely worrying to everyone in Britain.""'Under EU regulations, goods imported from outside the EU may be subject to tariffs.However, Mr Lyons says the prospect should not fill UK exporters with dread.""There are countries from all over the globe who are not in the Single Market who export into the EU.""And the other 85% of the UK economy which is domestically focused won't need those rules and regulations.""'Destabilising effect'Mr Sutherland also warned that a vote to leave the EU could be dangerous for the global economy and for European politics.""I think it would have a traumatic effect which would roll way beyond Britain's shores.""One of those consequences could be a destabilising effect on the European Union itself.""If Britain leaves it will provide oxygen for the nationalism the European Union was created to compete with.""But Mr Lyons dismissed the concerns.""There is considerable uncertainty for the UK if we tie ourselves to this slow growth region of the world economy and to the instability of the eurozone.""The problems in the European Union are self made."""
2016-05-30,Tory challenge to PM over immigration,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36407447,"David Cameron must accept the failure of the government's manifesto pledge to reduce migration into the UK, two leading Vote Leave MPs have said.Michael Gove and Boris Johnson said the pledge was ""corrosive of public trust"" while Britain remained in the EU.But Number 10 said their claim was an ""attempt to distract"" from the fact that an EU exit would be ""disastrous"".It comes amid growing Tory turmoil over the EU, with some MPs threatening a post-referendum leadership challenge.Meanwhile, a survey of economists has suggested that nine in 10 of those who responded believe leaving the EU would be damaging.There are less than four weeks to go until the UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union on 23 June.John Pienaar: Tory division escalatesEU referendum: All you need to knowIssues guide: Explore the argumentsImmigration is one of the key battlegrounds in the referendum debate - and it is the focus of an open letter to Mr Cameron, published in the Sunday Times, by Mr Gove and Mr Johnson, who say the government's pledge to get migration below 100,000 was unachievable.Net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving - rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high, and 188,000 for non-EU.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Mr Johnson and Mr Gove said: ""Voters were promised repeatedly at elections that net migration could be cut to tens of thousands.""This promise is plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU and the failure to keep it is corrosive of public trust in politics.""They also said they were ""particularly concerned about the impact of free movement in the future on public services"".""Class sizes will raise and waiting lists will lengthen if we don't tackle free movement,"" they wrote.In response to the letter, Number 10 said: ""This is a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that the overwhelming majority of economists and businesses believe leaving the single market would be disastrous for jobs, prices and opportunities for people.""By John Pienaar, deputy political editorThe Brexiteers point is that EU open borders make immigration control impossible.Its effect, though, is to accelerate a descent into internecine warfare which now threatens to make the Conservatives ungovernable if the referendum ends in anything but a decisive victory for the Remain campaign.So bitter has the conflict become, so taut the tension between the rival factions, that angry Eurosceptic Tories talk privately of challenging the prime minister's position even if Britain votes to stay inside the European Union.Read more from John PienaarThe row over the migration target comes as the Conservative in-fighting over the EU referendum intensifies.David Cameron and most of his cabinet are campaigning for a vote to stay in the EU, but about half of his MPs support an exit.Conservative Leave campaigner Andrew Bridgen told 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that as many as 50 Tory MPs were ready to back a vote of no-confidence in the prime minister over his handling of the debate.""If there's a small Remain vote... I think there probably would be 50 colleagues who'd be very dissatisfied with the prime minister's performance,"" the MP said.One MP, Nadine Dorries, said she had already sent a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, calling for a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron if Remain narrowly won.Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, she accused David Cameron of ""outright lies"" over the EU and said trust in him and George Osborne, the pro-Remain chancellor, ""has been absolutely shattered"".But former cabinet ministers and Leave campaigners Liam Fox and Iain Duncan Smith played down the prospect of a coup, and insisted they would want Mr Cameron to stay on as leader.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show Mr Fox said the referendum should not be turned into an internal Tory party debate. Also on Marr, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who backs Remain, warned that leaving the EU would not solve migration problems.""If you actually break down the figures on EU migration, many of these people come in on short-term contracts, and then will go back out again. Many of these people work in vital public services. ""And we also get the benefit. The reason we can travel around Europe, without restrictions, is because of the freedom of movement of people,"" he said.Ex-Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said public trust had been corroded by the government's failure to cut immigration, and said it was a ""foolish"" target for the Conservatives to have set.""You can not directly control, in a market economy, levels of net migration. It's not just free movement of labour in Europe, we can't control emigration,"" he told Radio 4's The World This Weekend.Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major criticised the Vote Leave campaign in the Mail on Sunday for the ""inaccuracies and falsehoods they are peddling to the British people"".He said the Leave campaign's focus on ""raising fears"" rather than ""setting out facts"" on immigration was ""distasteful""."

He said this was not a hypothetical risk but ""something you will see directly in people's jobs and living standards"" and in the confidence of business to trade.""What is now clear... is that if we did vote to leave, the economic aftershock would be severe,"" he added.Meanwhile, according to those economists who replied to the Ipsos-Mori poll for The Observer, leaving the EU single market would harm the UK's growth prospects over the next five years.How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.Those who took part and responded are members of the Royal Economic Society and the Society of Business Economists.Major reasons given by the economists as to why the UK would suffer were ""loss of access to the single market"" and ""increased uncertainty leading to reduced investment"".Britain Stronger in Europe campaign director Will Straw said: ""This is the final nail in the coffin of the Leave campaign's economic credibility.""It is becoming clear that leaving is a risk we simply cannot afford to take.""Labour's shadow home secretary Andy Burnham also told Sky News that the UK would be damaged by leaving the EU.However, Leave campaigners argue the UK would be freed from the cost of regulation and red tape imposed by Brussels if it left the EU.They also say it would able to negotiate its own trade deals.In The Sun newspaper on Saturday pro-Brexit government minister Priti Patel criticised Treasury forecasting of what would happen after a withdrawal from the EU, calling it ""doom-laden propaganda""."

They took control of Sanaa in 2014.A coalition of Arab air forces, led by Saudi Arabia, began carrying out air strikes on the rebels in March 2015, saying it was ""defending the legitimate government"" of Mr Hadi. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates at least 3,200 civilians have been killed and 5,700 wounded, with 60% of the casualties inflicted by air strikes, in the year since the air strikes began."
2016-05-30,Blair warns against Corbyn 'experiment',https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36401105,"It would be a ""very dangerous experiment"" for the UK to give Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn power, Tony Blair has told the BBC's This Week's World.The former Labour prime minister said the centre ground needed to work out how to recover and get ""its mojo back"".He also said he had ""real humility"" about the decisions he took on Iraq.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Blair's comments were ""a bit rich"", adding: ""I look forward to the Chilcot report.""During the interview Mr Blair said the dislike many felt for him was less to do with the Iraq War and more to do with him winning three general elections for Labour.""There are people who disagree with me for reasons that they say are to do with, say, Iraq, but actually are to do with the fact I won three elections for the Labour Party and they didn't like it,"" he said.Mr Blair has been a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn in the past, warning before the left-wing MP's leadership election victory that the party risked ""annihilation"" if he won.In an interview with the BBC's This Week's World, Mr Blair - Labour leader from 1994 to 2007, and PM for 10 of those years - dismissed the idea that Mr Corbyn's election as party leader was a direct rejection of him and his policies.""No,"" he said, ""I think it's a result of the way the world works these days. But it's a big challenge for the centre... It would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policy-making, left or right.""He added: ""I do think the centre ground needs to work out how it recovers... gets its mojo back and gets the initiative back in the political debate, because... these guys aren't providing answers, not on the economy, not on foreign policy.""John McDonnell, shadow chancellor and close ally of Mr Corbyn dismissed Mr Blair's comments.""I find that a bit rich from a prime minister who took us into the Iraq war which resulted in half a million deaths. So I think it's inappropriate for him to comment and I look forward to the Chilcot report,"" he said.Sir John Chilcot's long-awaited report into how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath, is to be published on 6 July.Ahead of its publication, Mr Blair told This Week's World: ""I have a real humility about the decisions that I took and the issues around them.""I was trying to deal with this in the aftermath of 9/11 and it was very tough - it was very difficult.""The former PM, who set up a foundation which works to promote greater understanding between the world's religions and to challenge extremism and prejudice, said the West was not to blame for the situation in the Middle East.And he warned of bigger terrorist attacks on Europe in future.""You've got to open your eyes to the problem. If we don't do that we're going to store up an even bigger problem for ourselves, and we face the problem in Europe, I'm afraid, of even bigger terror attacks.""I think we need to be in no doubt at all about the people we're dealing with here. If they could kill larger numbers of people that's what they would do,"" he said.The threat, he said, was ""different... from anything we have faced before"" and he said it required a ""different type of policy response and... a different rhythm of thinking"", as it would be a ""generation fight, it's not a fight that's going to be resolved in one year, two years, or even 10"".Mr Blair also called for action to redress the widespread problem of indoctrination of Muslim children in extremist ideologies across the Middle East. He said there needed to be a global commitment, where countries promoted cultural tolerance and rooted out cultural prejudice within their education systems.""If you end up polluting the mind of your people as they're growing up within your country, in today's world where the boundaries come down where there is much more migration and integration, then that is not just for your country - it's a problem for all of us.""

2016-05-30,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-30,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this.

Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-30,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36392341,"The claim: Migration to the UK is out of control and will get worse if Britain remains in the EU. Reality Check verdict: Net migration is still at near-record levels. Just over half of it comes from outside the EU. The government has not managed to bring migration from outside the EU down to tens of thousands as the 2010 and 2015 manifestos promised, so it is not clear it would be able to do so with EU migrants post-Brexit.A lot of people are migrating to the UK, and fewer people are leaving. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures on long-term migration every three months, and these basic facts haven't changed for years. Overall net migration stands at 333,000, and has risen more than a third since David Cameron came to power in 2010, with the aim of reducing numbers to tens of thousands a year.If you exclude Brits from the figures, things look even worse for the government's targets. Last year, 373,000 more non-Brits came to live in the UK than left, a 45% increase on 2010.With the referendum fast approaching, campaigners such as Nigel Farage say that immigration can only be brought back down to the tens of thousands if we leave the EU. While the UK can decide which immigrants it accepts from outside the EU, almost anyone from within the EU is entitled to come and live here. While the rest of the EU accounts for about 6% of the world's population, it's now the source of about 49% of UK net migration. That's up from 29% five years earlier, mainly because non-EU migration has steadied off, while EU migration has increased. It may be that the accession of new EU members has fuelled that rise. Home Secretary Theresa May said last month that the EU's free movement rules make controlling immigration ""harder"". But would leaving the EU really mean immigration came crashing down? In theory, the UK could put a block on any more EU citizens coming to live here, and that could cut the net migration figures in half at a stroke. But if that were going to happen to EU migrants, why hasn't it already happened to non-EU migrants? The UK isn't bound to accept them by any international treaties, but nevertheless let 277,000 of them move over last year alone. Three quarters of immigrants move to the UK for work or study, and the ratio is much the same for EU migrants. According to figures from Oxford University, nearly 60% of EU migrants coming over for work have got a job lined up before they arrive.Also, it is possible that a deal to retain access to the single market would require the UK to maintain freedom of movement for EU citizens wanting to come here to work.Unemployment rates have been falling more or less constantly for the past five years, and if the economy remains healthy the UK is likely to need just as many workers in future.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-30,John Pienaar,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/36407446,"Anyone who's followed politics for any length of time knows no party's more prone to suicidal bouts of indiscipline than the Labour Party.Unless, of course, it's the Conservative Party when it's in the mood.Just now, the Tories are in more of a mood than they've been since the chaotic days of the Major administration, and possibly since 1990, the year the party hacked down Margaret Thatcher in an orgy of political regicide prompted, naturally, by DNA-deep divisions over Europe.A surely impossible demand from any senior Conservative for David Cameron to accept his manifesto pledge to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is valueless on the ground it's ""corrosive of public trust"" - in other words because no-one believes it - would be embarrassing enough if delivered in private.Published in an open letter by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson (Gisela Stuart's a co-signatory, but Labour's internal debate is another story) it amounts to an escalation of a battle that now defies all established principles of government discipline and collective responsibility.And it does so in a way the prime minister will surely find very difficult to forgive.Harder still to overlook is the suggestion from once-favoured Employment Minister Priti Patel that the Remain campaign is led by people who are too privileged and rich, too posh, to understand the effect of mass migration on the less well off.She didn't actually name David Cameron or George Osborne, but it's not immediately apparent which other upper crust, public school and Oxbridge, multi-millionaires at the head of the Remain campaign she might have been referring to.There is a big argument at the heart of this.The Leave campaign calculates that worries about mass migration is a raw nerve which cannot be agitated too hard, or too often.It's their natural advantage, according to all public opinion research and the anecdotal evidence of countless doorstep encounters.Almost every Labour MP I meet tells me almost every voter they talk to brings it up, which I mention because Labour supporters matter hugely.Conservative voters are generally judged to lean naturally towards a ""Brexit"".In their open letter, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson's simple point is that EU open borders make immigration control impossible.The Leave campaign needs that point to hit home. The political cost of such a tactic may be high.It accelerates a descent into internecine warfare which now threatens to make the Conservative Party ungovernable if the referendum ends in anything but a decisive victory for the Remain campaign.So bitter has the conflict become, so taut the tension between the rival factions, that angry Eurosceptic Tories talk privately of challenging the prime minister's position even if Britain votes to stay inside the European Union.One of the most militant MPs, Andrew Bridgen, has gone public.He told me in an interview for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that he believes it ""highly likely"" at least 50 Tory MPs would sign demands for a vote of no confidence in the PM if the campaign goes on as it has.More than that, he suggests the Cameron administration could be reduced to what he and others call a ""zombie government"" by its divided MPs, unable to govern and forced to consider a snap election.At Westminster, that kind of apocalyptic talk is becoming more common.Some of the whispering is - and is probably intended to be - hair-raising.I've heard it suggested that three members of the Cameron administration have become so upset by the tone of campaigning on the Remain side led by the prime minister that they are contemplating resignation, not just from the government, but from the Tory whip, effectively quitting the party.True? We may never know. But the whispering is becoming feverish.One MP on the now militant Eurosceptic wing said letters demanding a vote of confidence in the PM had already been submitted to the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, who's a sort of posh shop-steward for Conservative MPs.Mr Brady himself is bound by a sacred oath of secrecy where such matters are concerned, so we must wait to find out.The Sunday Times newspaper carries more mutinous muttering.Former Environment Secretary Owen Patterson told the paper: ""The government now has four weeks to behave properly.""If they don't, there are risks they will cause long term damage to the Conservative Party.""Another, unnamed MP, puts it more bluntly: ""When you tell Tories they are immoral for supporting Brexiteers you are going to get a kick in the nuts.""We'll see, of course. Everything depends on which side wins the referendum, and perhaps on the margin of victory.Mr Cameron insists he would carry on as prime minister if Britain votes to leave the EU.The more common view, shared among his closest supporters, is that he would be toast.If the vote is to remain an EU member, the reaction of Conservative MPs will be more a matter of chemistry than maths.Angry Eurosceptics (should we be calling them EU-rophobes?) may, or may not, be cross enough and strong enough in numbers to force a vote of confidence in the prime minister.Even then, winning that vote would be a tall order. It would need the support of 165 MPs. Not easy.More immediately worrisome, it would need a fraction of that number - just nine Tory MPs - to defeat any government vote in the Commons when combined with all opposition parties.On a realistic estimate, about 25 Conservatives are now sufficiently irate to press for a vote of no confidence in the PM.Fewer than half that number could produce the ""zombie government"" to which Andrew Bridgen referred.Ministers could be forced to discard any proposal that might meet any serious opposition, governing as if it was a minority, not a majority administration.Life would suddenly become very difficult.So a vote to remain could be a Pyrrhic victory if the margin is tight.And until we know the outcome on Friday 24 June, this self-destructive struggle is likely to intensify before it calms again - assuming, that is, the party is not already broken beyond repair."
2016-05-30,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."
2016-05-30,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36401744,"The Claim: The two sides in the EU referendum campaign have been accused of peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"" by a committee of MPs.Reality Check verdict: There is growing acceptance that both sides could be clearer about the figures they're using to support their arguments. The Treasury Select Committee has criticised both sides in the EU Referendum campaign for peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"".Its chair, Andrew Tyrie, told BBC News: ""What we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides.""The Reality Check team has been keeping an eye on how both sides have been using numbers throughout the campaign. Here are a few from each side.Andrew Tyrie cited the claim that the UK sends £350m a week to Brussels and it could be spent on the NHS instead as particularly problematic. The claim ignores the rebate, which means that amount of money is not sent to Brussels each week. Also, some of the money is returned to the UK to be spent on things like farming subsidies and regional development, and Leave campaigners have not suggested these payments should stop.The claim, which appears on the Vote Leave bus, has also been criticised repeatedly by the UK Statistics Authority. Its chair, Sir Andrew Dilnot, said on Friday he was ""disappointed"" the figure was still being used.You can read the full Reality Check on the £350m claim here. And there is a discussion of why all the money could not be spent on the NHS here.Another claim criticised was the government's suggestion that leaving the EU could cost your family £4,300.The committee pointed out that this was confusing GDP per household with household income and expressed disappointment that so much emphasis had been placed on this figure.You can read Reality Check's take on the £4,300 claim here.The committee's report also said: ""It is misleading to claim, as some campaign groups continue to do, that three million jobs are dependent on EU membership.The Reality Check team covered the Prime Minister saying this, and also David Milliband using a variation on it.You can read about Mr Milliband's assertion that 100,000 jobs in the North East are dependent on the EU here.The committee criticised the claim that the Common Agricultural Policy costs £400 per household per year as being based on out-of-date research. It also questioned how much of that money could be saved by leaving the EU.You'll find discussion of the figure as part of this selection of claims made by Boris Johnson.The committee criticised the Treasury's failure to get its analysis on the short-term consequences of leaving the EU to it in time to include it as part of the report.It described the delays as ""highly unsatisfactory"" and inconsistent with commitments made to the committee by the Chancellor.You can read the Reality Check assessment of the year-long recession claim made by the Treasury here.The Vote Leave claim that the cost of EU regulations was £33.3bn a year or £600m a week was described in the report as a ""tendentious representation of the research on which it is based"".The figure, which came from Open Europe, was an assessment of the cost of complying with the 100 most ""burdensome"" regulations.You can read more about the £600m claim on regulation here.Andrew Tyrie told BBC News that the report had been accepted unanimously by the committee, despite it containing prominent figures from both sides of the debate.""This is unanimous - they accepted what's in the report,"" he said.

2016-05-30,Is it 'workin'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380007,"The battle between the Remain and Leave sides in the EU referendum is in full swing and social media is being used by both camps to try to win the race.Younger voters have so far been slower to register to vote and campaigners are keen to win their attention and support.Some strategies have enjoyed surprise success while others have misfired completely. The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be. As PR strategy consultant Deborah Mattinson says: ""Social media campaigns need to be totally spot on or it's absolutely awful.""Compiled by Zak Brophy"
2016-05-30,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36378586,"The question: Simon asks BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Would withdrawal from the EU mean that more British footballers had a chance to play in the Premier League, and would those European-sourced players no longer have free access to appear in English teams?""Reality Check verdict: This depends on whether home clubs decide to bring in more top level international players or give opportunities to British footballers. At the moment, EU players have the freedom to participate in British football, while non-EU players have to have a work permit in order to play in the Premier League. We don't know what deal would be cut in the event of Brexit, but we can look at the situation for non-EU players at the moment as an indication of the direction things might take. For non-EU players to be granted a work permit, they must demonstrate they are an international player of ""the highest calibre."" This means they must have played in 75% of a Fifa top-50 ranked national team's matches over the previous two years.The Home Office made it harder for non-EU players to get work visas last year, a move which the FA (Football Association) hoped would give more opportunities for home-grown talent to rise to the top.FA chairman Greg Dyke said at the time that if the new system had been applied over the previous five years, there would have been 42 fewer non-European players in the Premier and Football Leagues. If this kind of reduction was replicated for EU players following a British exit, this would leave vacancies on British teams. Indeed, the BBC's Matt Slater has suggested only 23 of the 180 non-British EU players currently playing in the Championship would get work permits. In theory, those 157 remaining spots could be filled by British players.But clubs would still be able to recruit the best players from around the world. A 2014 FA report suggested while Spanish, French and German players featured heavily in Champions League games, Brazilian players were also a major source of competition, with more than twice as many as English players appearing in any Champions League group stage games in 2013. Vacancies left by ""non-elite"" EU players could be filled by Brits, or they could be filled or by other, more elite international players. Whether home clubs would focus their attentions on attracting the top international players who would remain eligible for work permits, or on giving opportunities to British footballers following a Brexit is likely to depend on factors unrelated to the EU - such as the quality of coaching and the strength of the British talent pool.

2016-05-30,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.Shadow mental health minister - Luciana BergerThe Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election.

2016-05-31,Cameron hails 'proud Muslim' Khan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36410749,"David Cameron has hailed Labour's Sadiq Khan as ""a proud Muslim"" and ""a proud Brit"" as he shared a platform with the London Mayor at an EU Remain rally. They were launching a Britain Stronger In Europe battle bus and pledge card.But Vote Leave said the PM's criticisms of Mr Khan during the mayoral contest less than a month ago showed he could not be trusted.UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said the PM had accused Mr Khan of being a ""terrorist sympathiser"".Mr Cameron repeatedly attacked Mr Khan for having a history of sharing platforms with extremists - a claim firmly rejected by Mr Khan - as part of the Conservatives' failed campaign to get Zac Goldsmith elected to City Hall.At Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons some Labour MPs denounced Mr Cameron as a racist when he questioned Mr Khan's judgment.At the Remain campaign event in London, Mr Cameron appeared to bury the hatchet.He shook hands with Mr Khan and congratulated him on his victory in the mayoral contest, telling the crowd: ""I'm proud to be here with the mayor of London - with the Labour mayor of London - on this vital, vital issue.""He hailed the fact that ""someone who is a proud Muslim, a proud Brit and a proud Londoner can become mayor of the greatest city on Earth. That says something about our country"".The prime minister said he expected many disagreements with the London Mayor but they were both part of ""an incredibly broad campaign"" in favour of EU membership.Mr Cameron described himself as a ""Eurosceptic"" but said the ability to criticise the EU is ""a cause of strength in our campaign... we're levelling with people, something the other side refuses to do"".Mr Khan defended his decision to share a platform with the Conservative prime minister - something Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to do, despite being on the same side as him in the referendum debate.The London mayor said: ""There are many things on which the prime minister and I will disagree. But what's really important is when it's in Londoners' interests for the mayor and the government to work closely together, we will work closely together.""He claimed ""more than half a million jobs"" in London depended on the UK's membership of the EU, adding: ""A vote for Remain means jobs and opportunities."" Staying in the EU meant more measures to fight climate change, ""workers' rights protected and more rights for women,"" he added, and he urged young people to ""get involved"" in the referendum and register to vote.Vote Leave spokesman and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said voters ""should not trust David Cameron"".""Just a month ago he attacked Sadiq Khan as a terrorist sympathiser, yet today he hailed him as a great politician as he stood next to him on a shared platform.""Today he trumpeted the benefits of the European Arrest Warrant but a few years ago he warned that it was dangerous and that it stripped away centuries old rights from the British people.""David Cameron's flip-flops show that he is not a man of principle - he is just desperate to cling on to power"".Mr Cameron and Mr Khan unveiled a ""five point guarantee card"" listing what they say voters will get if they vote to Remain on 23 June. The card promises ""full access"" to the EU single market, protection of workers' rights, ""a safer Britain"" with co-operation with other EU states, the UK keeping its ""special status"" within the EU, outside the euro and the Schengen passport-free area and with an opt-out from the EU's aim of ""ever-closer union"" and ""stability"".Vote Leave hit back with a list of five things they say will happen if Britain votes to remain in the EU.These include much disputed assertion that the UK will continue to ""send £350m a week to Brussels,"" a claim that the free movement of people in the EU will continue ""permanently"" and that Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey join, a warning about business red tape, and a claim that ""we will continue to be unable to remove criminals and terrorists whose presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good"".

The plan to ask job applicants if they went to private school is part of the PM's push to improve ""life chances"".The Cabinet Office said the plan would be voluntary.But Lord Waldegrave, who served under Lady Thatcher and John Major and is now the Crown-appointed head of Eton's governing body, has threatened to quit the Conservative Party if the government pushes ahead with it.He told the Daily Telegraph: ""Fundamentally, I think it quite wrong to punish children for decisions taken by their parents, and to run the risk of choosing crucial public service jobs not on the basis of merit but of social engineering. The ablest candidates come from all possible backgrounds.""I have told the chief whip in the Lords that I do not see how I could continue to accept the whip if I believed that the government was actively seeking to damage the charitable school of which I am a trustee, and the many other schools like it which are meeting the justifiable demands of the Charity Commission to help the wider community.""Eton College, a boys-only boarding school, which also counts former London mayor Boris Johnson among its former pupils, charges £12,354 a term but it says 21% of pupils receive financial support towards their fees through bursaries.David Cameron has frequently defended his privileged background, saying he was fortunate to attend one of Britain's top schools and he wants all children in the UK to have the same chances in life.Other proposals in his ""life chances"" agenda include forcing top universities to publish the proportion of ethnic minority applicants who secure places, and giving more support to children leaving local authority care.Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock is drawing up proposals to allow companies and recruiters to check the ""socio-economic background"" of those applying for jobs.The idea is to be tried out on applicants for Civil Service jobs initially.A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""We are fully committed to increasing social mobility, and building a Civil Service that represents the country that it serves.The proposals we have outlined to measure social background are part of a broad consultation and no legislation is being put forward. ""While voluntary, we are already hugely encouraged by the number of businesses that are grasping this and helping us to shape these measures and therefore enhance social mobility.""Our whole approach is about levelling up, not denying opportunities to anyone.

In the past five years the department has paid around £5.5m to the Western European Union, which is now defunct.Critics said it was a waste of taxpayers' money but the Foreign Office says the UK has been pushing to get the WEU fully closed as soon as possible.The payments were revealed by a Freedom of Information request.The BBC's FOI request disclosed that payments have been made to cover residual pension obligations which were not fully financed by arrangements made by the organisation prior to closure, as well into a fund to cover potential shortfalls in wind-up costs and unforeseen legal costs.The Western European Union, established in 1954, was a military alliance of West European states set up to coordinate defence policies against the common Soviet threat at the height of the Cold War. However, after the relaxation of east-west tensions in Europe, most of the organisation's security functions were transferred into the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union.The members of the Western European Union moved to terminate the organisation in March 2010, and the WEU was formally declared defunct in June 2011.The Western European Union was formed by Britain, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in 1948 by the Treaty of Brussels, to defend against the possibility of a renewed threat from Germany.But the Brussels-based organisation was quickly eclipsed by the formation of NATO with the United States, the following year, when attention switched to the threat of attack from the Soviet Union.It nevertheless grew to include 10 European nations, including Germany and Italy.  It was meant to be independent of NATO, with its own chiefs of staff and military command but, in practice, it was little more than a talking shop, which mounted few military operations of its own.It held its final committee meeting in late 2000, when its functions were absorbed into the European Union, as part of moves to create an EU rapid reaction force and common defence policy. It was not formally closed down until 2011.The fact that government money is still being paid towards the organisation has prompted criticism.Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of campaign group the Taxpayers' Alliance said: ""Taxpayers will be scratching their heads as to why they're still paying for a Cold War-era organisation 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. ""Because this organisation continued to exist well past its sell by date, British taxpayers are still picking up a bill for huge pay-offs. ""The government must make every effort to close the book on the WEU and limit taxpayers' liabilities.""Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is campaigning to leave the EU, said:  ""A gravy train seems to have become a ghost train."" The Foreign Office said in a statement: ""While the UK will continue to meet all of its obligations to former WEU employees, our overall objective is to move the WEU towards full closure.""We continue to work with other former member states to address all outstanding legacy issues as quickly and efficiently as possible."""
2016-05-31,Two charged after migrant boat rescue,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36412728,"Two British men have appeared in court charged with immigration offences after a boat carrying 20 people was rescued off the Kent coast on Sunday.Robert Stilwell, 33, from Dartford, and Mark Stribling, 35, from Farningham, appeared at Medway Magistrates Court accused of people smuggling.Those rescued included 18 Albanian migrants, two of them children.An ex-chief immigration inspector said earlier people would die unless more were done to stop crossing attempts.Mr Stilwell and Mr Stribling were charged with conspiring to facilitate the entry of non-EU nationals, and remanded in custody to appear before Maidstone Crown Court on 27 June.The UK coastguard said it was called just before midnight on Saturday to an incident off the coastal village of Dymchurch.Residents: 'It's a bit of a worry'How is the UK-France border policed?Those on board the boat reportedly alerted their families in Calais after their inflatable boat started taking in water.Rescuers said a helicopter from nearby Lydd and two lifeboats from Dungeness and Folkestone were sent to the incident off Dymchurch.At about 02:00 BST on Sunday, a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, known as a ""rhib"", with 20 people on board was found.Trevor Bunney, who was part of the RNLI lifeboat rescue team, said the people they rescued were ""a bit dishevelled, [had] obviously been at sea a long time and not in the best of conditions"". ""One lady had the first signs of hypothermia,"" he said.After being rescued, the group were handed over to the UK Border Force and taken to Dover.A second vessel - which officials say could be linked to the incident - was discovered on the beach at Dymchurch.Since the rescue on Sunday, concerns have been raised that sea tragedies, similar to those seen on the voyage to Turkey, Greece or Italy, could occur in the English Channel.There is an ""equal chance"" of migrants drowning in the Channel as in the Mediterranean, former chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine said.Mr Vine, who was chief inspector until 2014, said: ""We have seen the tragedies that have occurred in the Mediterranean.He added that the hazards of Channel sea traffic, weather and sea conditions ""are going to mean there is an equal chance of people losing their lives unless this is stopped.""""Clearly if this is now the start of something new, then really that needs to be reassessed and resources need to be put in,"" he added.By Simon Jones, BBC correspondentMany people living along the Kent coast are shocked, but not surprised at what's happened. The Channel is a huge stretch of water to patrol - and the authorities are often relying on tip-offs to try to catch those responsible.Some residents are asking how many migrants are managing to get through without being detected. The fear is that with the recent security clampdown at the Port of Calais and Eurotunnel, more and more migrants will attempt to cross the Channel on small boats, putting their lives at risk.At the Port of Dover, the boat from which the migrants were rescued is still being painstakingly examined. It would have been a tight fit to get 20 people on board, crammed into the small craft in the busiest shipping lane in the world.UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said it was ""essential that a clear message is sent that no migrant arriving on our shores by boat is allowed leave to remain"".""We have all seen the horrors of the Mediterranean, with thousands crossing and hundreds dying, we cannot allow that to happen off the shores of Kent and Sussex.""However, Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said it was ""too early to say whether this is a new trend"".He told BBC Radio 5 live it was wrong to say the UK's coastline was ""undefended"", saying the Channel was ""probably the most monitored stretch of water in the world"".Sunday's incident comes after 17 men, thought to be Albanian migrants, were detained when a catamaran arrived at Chichester Marina in West Sussex on Tuesday, along with a 55-year-old British man wanted on suspicion of murder in Spain.The Briton, who was the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, was detained on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration and the 17 men were held on suspicion of entering the UK illegally.Also last month, two Iranian men were found floating in a dinghy in the Channel."

Follow the latest updates on our live pageIn a joint letter to the prime minister, Mr Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove said Mr Cameron's promise to reduce net migration to below 100,000 at last year's general election was ""plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU"".Following the letter, a number of Conservative MPs broke ranks to call for Mr Cameron to quit even if the Remain campaign wins in 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU. Nadine Dorries - a long standing backbench critic of the prime minister who says she would back Mr Johnson in any contest to replace him - predicted the PM would be ""toast"" if Remain won by a narrow margin. She told ITV's Peston on Sunday she had tabled a letter seeking a no-confidence vote in Mr Cameron.Fellow Leave campaigner Andrew Bridgen suggested more than the 50 Conservative MPs needed to trigger such a vote were ready to move against Mr Cameron.In his Today interview, Mr Clarke said Conservative in-fighting was ""damaging to the referendum"". ""The public are getting fed up with Tory civil wars when they thought they were being asked about the future of this country for their children and grandchildren.""All this stuff about whether one or two backbenchers have signed letters calling for David Cameron to resign, I think most of the public would agree, is a bit of a diversion. ""I think Boris and Donald Trump should go away for a bit and enjoy themselves and not get in the way of the serious issues which modern countries of the 21st century face.""Pressed on his opinion of Mr Johnson, he said: ""He is a much nicer version of Donald Trump but the campaign is remarkably similar in my opinion and about as relevant to the real problems that the public face.""Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, who entered Parliament at the 2015 election, said she hoped hostilities between Tory MPs would cease after the referendum.""Of the new intake, the 2015 intake, we're very much hoping that after the referendum we can get back to doing the work we set out to do and that David Cameron as the prime minister will be leading that way,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.Number 10 dismissed the personal attacks as a ""distraction"" intended to move attention away from the economic arguments for remaining in the EU.  Republican candidate Mr Trump sparked controversy by suggesting a temporary ""ban"" on Muslims entering the United States and has pledged to build a wall to prevent Mexican illegal immigrants entering the country."
2016-05-31,EU Commission appointment criticised,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36412098,"A top EU watchdog has strongly criticised the European Commission over the appointment of a special adviser.European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said the appointment of Edmund Stoiber in 2014 was a case of ""maladministration"" because the Commission had bypassed conflict of interest checks.Mr Stoiber, a former prime minister of Bavaria, headed a team that sought to cut the cost of EU regulations. Ms O'Reilly has now widened her inquiry into EU special adviser appointments.The Commission has about 40 such advisers, who have high-level access to EU politicians and often work for other private sector clients, the BBC's Nick Beake reports from Brussels.In December 2014 the Commission failed to make public Mr Stoiber's disclosure that he also held positions with a big insurance company. Commenting on the question of EU transparency in such appointments, Ms O'Reilly said that ""culturally, there is not sufficient acceptance of why this is an issue"". ""I get the sense people don't think it's a big deal. The Commission needs to get a lot more serious. It is not taking it sufficiently seriously.""  The ombudsman investigates allegations of EU maladministration - sometimes made by ordinary citizens. She can call officials to account, but does not have any judicial powers.Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker brought the German politician in because of his experience in cutting bureaucratic costs for small and medium-sized businesses in the EU single market. For seven years he headed an expert High-Level Group advising the 28 member states on efficient ways to implement EU regulations.The Commission says Mr Stoiber's group managed to cut administrative costs for businesses by more than 25%, giving a saving EU-wide of more than €33bn (£25bn; $37bn).Mrs O'Reilly also accused the Commission of an ongoing lack of transparency in its dealings with the tobacco industry. And she said the Eurogroup - the group of eurozone finance ministers - ought to be more open. "
2016-05-31,Sugar tax will 'hit poorest hardest',https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36410589,"The planned sugar tax will ""hit poorest families hardest"" and has nothing to do with the sugar content of products, the Taxpayers' Alliance says.The group, which wants the levy to be axed, tested 49 drinks and found that some coffee shop drinks had more sugar than Coca Cola, but would not be taxed.Anti-obesity campaigners welcomed the tax when it was announced in March.The Treasury said soft drinks would be taxed because they were the main source of added sugar in children's diets.Sugar tax: How will it work?What is the UK's most sugary drink?The Taxpayers' Alliance (TPA) survey found that Coca-Cola, with 10.6g of sugar per 100ml, will be subject to the levy, but a Starbucks signature hot chocolate with whipped cream and coconut milk, which has 11g of sugar per 100ml, will not.The study also noted energy drinks such as Monster Origin, 11g/100ml, will be taxed, but Tesco chocolate flavoured milk, 12.4g/100ml, will not be.Overall, the 10 most sugary drinks analysed by the group which campaigns for lower taxes will not be subject to the levy.The recommended maximum intake of added sugar per day for those aged 11 and over is about 30g or seven teaspoons, the NHS says.TPA chief executive Jonathan Isaby said it was ""deeply concerning"" that the government was ""pushing ahead with this regressive tax which will hit the poorest families hardest"".""The evidence shows that the sugar tax has nothing to do with the sugar content of products, so it is farcical to suggest that this will have any positive impact on people's diet or lifestyle choices,"" he said.""This is yet another example of  irresponsible meddling from the high priests of the nanny state, introducing entirely unnecessary complications into an already complicated tax system and pushing up the cost of everyday products for hard-pressed families.""The NHS has also said it would impose its own ""sugar tax"" in hospitals and health centres in England.Chief executive Simon Stevens said he wanted the 20% tax on all sugary drinks and foods in NHS cafes to be introduced by 2020. It is hoped the NHS levy, which would initially just apply to sugary drinks, could raise £20m-40m a year, with the money raised used to improve the health of its workforce. The ""tax"" would also be put in place with the aim of discouraging staff, patients and visitors from buying sugary goods.  A Treasury spokesman said the soft drinks industry levy was ""a major step forward in our efforts to tackle childhood obesity"".""Treating obesity and its consequences costs the taxpayer £5.1bn every year,"" he said.""The levy will be charged on soft drinks because they are the main source of added sugar in children's and teenagers' diets, many with no intrinsic nutritional value.""Health experts agree there is a specific problem with sugar-laden fizzy drinks that must be addressed.""He said the money from the tax would go towards funding more school sport and expanding school breakfast clubs."

""The WTO would not give the right to provide services,"" he warned. ""At the moment the banking system of Britain provides services all over Europe because by being part of the European Union they have what's called a single passport and they can operate everywhere.""If Britain left the European Union it would not have a single passport and many financial services companies might say 'we can't have our headquarters in a country that is outside the European Union' and they might well move.

Increasingly financial regulation is set at a global level.""'Appalling complexity'Mr Sutherland has also warned that manufacturers could be hit if the UK votes to leave the EU, saying they will face more regulation than currently.""If you sell manufactured goods into the European Union under WTO rules, you have to be able to prove - and this means inspections at borders - that the component parts are from Britain.""If, for example, you are exporting cars and the engines are made in another country, that will all have to be checked and different tariff rates might be applicable to some of the components.""You're in a new ball game of appalling complexity and the prospect of that should be extremely worrying to everyone in Britain.""'Under EU regulations, goods imported from outside the EU may be subject to tariffs.However, Mr Lyons says the prospect should not fill UK exporters with dread.""There are countries from all over the globe who are not in the Single Market who export into the EU.""And the other 85% of the UK economy which is domestically focused won't need those rules and regulations.""'Destabilising effect'Mr Sutherland also warned that a vote to leave the EU could be dangerous for the global economy and for European politics.""I think it would have a traumatic effect which would roll way beyond Britain's shores.""One of those consequences could be a destabilising effect on the European Union itself.""If Britain leaves it will provide oxygen for the nationalism the European Union was created to compete with.""But Mr Lyons dismissed the concerns.""There is considerable uncertainty for the UK if we tie ourselves to this slow growth region of the world economy and to the instability of the eurozone.""The problems in the European Union are self made."""
2016-05-31,Tory challenge to PM over immigration,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36407447,"David Cameron must accept the failure of the government's manifesto pledge to reduce migration into the UK, two leading Vote Leave MPs have said.Michael Gove and Boris Johnson said the pledge was ""corrosive of public trust"" while Britain remained in the EU.But Number 10 said their claim was an ""attempt to distract"" from the fact that an EU exit would be ""disastrous"".It comes amid growing Tory turmoil over the EU, with some MPs threatening a post-referendum leadership challenge.Meanwhile, a survey of economists has suggested that nine in 10 of those who responded believe leaving the EU would be damaging.There are less than four weeks to go until the UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union on 23 June.John Pienaar: Tory division escalatesEU referendum: All you need to knowIssues guide: Explore the argumentsImmigration is one of the key battlegrounds in the referendum debate - and it is the focus of an open letter to Mr Cameron, published in the Sunday Times, by Mr Gove and Mr Johnson, who say the government's pledge to get migration below 100,000 was unachievable.Net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving - rose to 333,000 in 2015, according to Office for National Statistics estimates.The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high, and 188,000 for non-EU.This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.Mr Johnson and Mr Gove said: ""Voters were promised repeatedly at elections that net migration could be cut to tens of thousands.""This promise is plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU and the failure to keep it is corrosive of public trust in politics.""They also said they were ""particularly concerned about the impact of free movement in the future on public services"".""Class sizes will raise and waiting lists will lengthen if we don't tackle free movement,"" they wrote.In response to the letter, Number 10 said: ""This is a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that the overwhelming majority of economists and businesses believe leaving the single market would be disastrous for jobs, prices and opportunities for people.""By John Pienaar, deputy political editorThe Brexiteers point is that EU open borders make immigration control impossible.Its effect, though, is to accelerate a descent into internecine warfare which now threatens to make the Conservatives ungovernable if the referendum ends in anything but a decisive victory for the Remain campaign.So bitter has the conflict become, so taut the tension between the rival factions, that angry Eurosceptic Tories talk privately of challenging the prime minister's position even if Britain votes to stay inside the European Union.Read more from John PienaarThe row over the migration target comes as the Conservative in-fighting over the EU referendum intensifies.David Cameron and most of his cabinet are campaigning for a vote to stay in the EU, but about half of his MPs support an exit.Conservative Leave campaigner Andrew Bridgen told 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that as many as 50 Tory MPs were ready to back a vote of no-confidence in the prime minister over his handling of the debate.""If there's a small Remain vote... I think there probably would be 50 colleagues who'd be very dissatisfied with the prime minister's performance,"" the MP said.One MP, Nadine Dorries, said she had already sent a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, calling for a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron if Remain narrowly won.Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, she accused David Cameron of ""outright lies"" over the EU and said trust in him and George Osborne, the pro-Remain chancellor, ""has been absolutely shattered"".But former cabinet ministers and Leave campaigners Liam Fox and Iain Duncan Smith played down the prospect of a coup, and insisted they would want Mr Cameron to stay on as leader.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show Mr Fox said the referendum should not be turned into an internal Tory party debate. Also on Marr, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who backs Remain, warned that leaving the EU would not solve migration problems.""If you actually break down the figures on EU migration, many of these people come in on short-term contracts, and then will go back out again. Many of these people work in vital public services. ""And we also get the benefit. The reason we can travel around Europe, without restrictions, is because of the freedom of movement of people,"" he said.Ex-Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said public trust had been corroded by the government's failure to cut immigration, and said it was a ""foolish"" target for the Conservatives to have set.""You can not directly control, in a market economy, levels of net migration. It's not just free movement of labour in Europe, we can't control emigration,"" he told Radio 4's The World This Weekend.Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major criticised the Vote Leave campaign in the Mail on Sunday for the ""inaccuracies and falsehoods they are peddling to the British people"".He said the Leave campaign's focus on ""raising fears"" rather than ""setting out facts"" on immigration was ""distasteful""."

They took control of Sanaa in 2014.A coalition of Arab air forces, led by Saudi Arabia, began carrying out air strikes on the rebels in March 2015, saying it was ""defending the legitimate government"" of Mr Hadi. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates at least 3,200 civilians have been killed and 5,700 wounded, with 60% of the casualties inflicted by air strikes, in the year since the air strikes began."

But it's a big challenge for the centre... It would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policy-making, left or right.""He added: ""I do think the centre ground needs to work out how it recovers... gets its mojo back and gets the initiative back in the political debate, because... these guys aren't providing answers, not on the economy, not on foreign policy.""John McDonnell, shadow chancellor and close ally of Mr Corbyn dismissed Mr Blair's comments.""I find that a bit rich from a prime minister who took us into the Iraq war which resulted in half a million deaths. So I think it's inappropriate for him to comment and I look forward to the Chilcot report,"" he said.Sir John Chilcot's long-awaited report into how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath, is to be published on 6 July.Ahead of its publication, Mr Blair told This Week's World: ""I have a real humility about the decisions that I took and the issues around them.""I was trying to deal with this in the aftermath of 9/11 and it was very tough - it was very difficult.""The former PM, who set up a foundation which works to promote greater understanding between the world's religions and to challenge extremism and prejudice, said the West was not to blame for the situation in the Middle East.And he warned of bigger terrorist attacks on Europe in future.""You've got to open your eyes to the problem. If we don't do that we're going to store up an even bigger problem for ourselves, and we face the problem in Europe, I'm afraid, of even bigger terror attacks.""I think we need to be in no doubt at all about the people we're dealing with here. If they could kill larger numbers of people that's what they would do,"" he said.The threat, he said, was ""different... from anything we have faced before"" and he said it required a ""different type of policy response and... a different rhythm of thinking"", as it would be a ""generation fight, it's not a fight that's going to be resolved in one year, two years, or even 10"".Mr Blair also called for action to redress the widespread problem of indoctrination of Muslim children in extremist ideologies across the Middle East. He said there needed to be a global commitment, where countries promoted cultural tolerance and rooted out cultural prejudice within their education systems.""If you end up polluting the mind of your people as they're growing up within your country, in today's world where the boundaries come down where there is much more migration and integration, then that is not just for your country - it's a problem for all of us.""

2016-05-31,EU referendum poll tracker,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589,"Several pollsters have reported a swing to remain in their most recent polls. But it's not a consistent pattern and, in some cases, the shifts have at least partly been caused by small changes to their methodologies. Senior BBC political analyst Peter Barnes examines the latest poll trends.Read the full methodologyIpsos Mori's latest poll gave remain a 55-37 lead, with 8% saying they were undecided or wouldn't vote. That's the biggest gap between the two sides we've seen since February.On the other hand, ICM's online poll showed a 47-43 lead for leave, with 10% saying don't know, a small shift away from remain.Some observers argue that betting odds provide a better clue to the outcome of elections and referendums than opinion polls. At last year's general election, for example, the bookmakers' odds suggested that the Conservatives would do better than the polls indicated. And they did.If that's true then Remain looks the most likely result.The referendum is expected to be the biggest ever political betting event in the UK. Millions of pounds have already been gambled on the outcome.Last week several bookmakers cut their odds for a vote to remain to 1/6. That means people would have to risk £6 for a potential profit of £1.Ladbrokes reported that there were lots of people prepared to back Remain despite the short odds.Most bookmakers have the odds for leave at 7/2. A £2 stake would return a profit of £7.Perhaps an easier way to track the bookmakers' odds over time is to look at what they imply about the chances are of each side winning. If both sides were at evens they'd both have an implied probability of 50%. On the Betfair betting exchange, the probability they suggest of a remain vote has risen from about 65% a month ago to nearly 80% now.Another market that's very sensitive to news about the referendum is the currency market.After the publication of the Ipsos Mori poll last week, with its large lead for remain, the value of the pound jumped by almost two cents against both the US dollar and the euro.That's because many currency traders expect that the uncertainty caused by a vote for Brexit would lead to a sharp drop in the value of sterling - at least in the short term.We're always told not to pay too much attention to individual polls but clearly some traders think there's been a decisive shift. There's a consistent pattern: in telephone polls remain tends to be in the lead; in internet polls the two sides are neck and neck.The discrepancy between the two types of poll has narrowed in the last few months.The lead for remain in phone polls is now about 8-12% when people who respond ""don't know"" are eliminated, down from about 20% last year. Internet polls have been suggesting a virtual dead heat for months.There's been a lot of discussion about why the two types of poll are different and which is more accurate.One theory is that the internet polls get more ""don't know"" or ""undecided"" responses because they offer it as an option on the screen. In phone polls, ""don't know"" is not usually offered as an option although respondents can choose not to back either side.The theory is that more people who say ""don't know"" in internet polls are likely to vote remain than leave when push comes to shove.Martin Boon at ICM has suggested that the samples in phone polls may contain too many Labour voters, as they did at the general election, and that the samples in internet polls may contain too many UKIP voters.That would skew the phone polls in remain's favour - Labour voters tend to break for remain by at least two to one - and skew the internet polls in favour of leave, suggesting that the true balance of opinion is somewhere in between.My colleague Chris Cook has looked at this issue in more depth.Pollsters have also reported some interesting results beyond straightforward voting intention.Several have asked people which issue would be most important in their decision about how to vote.ICM found that 45% of people said that immigration into the UK was the most important, followed by the impact on the UK's economy on 36%. (Sample: 2,029, 27-29 April)Similar polls by ComRes and Ipsos MORI have put the same two issues at the top of the list but in reverse order.Interestingly, the division between internet and telephone polls is noticeable here too: ICM's poll was conducted by internet, the other two by phone.Referendum a turn-off?ComRes also asked whether people were bored by the referendum. Sixty-three percent said they weren't, which is probably a good thing because there are still many weeks to go.I wonder how many will be bored by the end?"
2016-05-31,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"A referendum is being held on Thursday, 23 June to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold one if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over our daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron said: ""It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.""The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutes""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals living abroad who have been on the electoral register in the UK in the past 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Yes. This was the big news back in January and February as David Cameron sought an agreement with other European Union leaders to change the terms of Britain's membership. He says the deal, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, gives Britain ""special"" status within the 28 nation club, and will help sort out some of the things British people say they don't like about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and giving up the ability to run our own affairs.  Critics say his deal will make little difference and falls well short of what he had promised when he announced his plan for a referendum. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotThe main points of the deal are: The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".Prime Minister David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen members of his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wants Britain to remain in the EU, as do other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU say it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins a general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It has designated lead campaigns for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:A lot of people asked about this. To be clear, if you are a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen on the electoral register you will be able to vote in the referendum. You will not have to register specially. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register. If you want to take part in the referendum and you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:Northern Ireland - 5pm, Friday 3 June 2016Great Britain - 5pm, Wednesday 8 June 2016 In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way. In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The ECHR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As John points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Virginia, from Hayling Island, asked several questions around the concept of the single market. You could probably write a book on this one. But we'll try to keep it brief. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketDee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out. HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.Philip, from Kriton in Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, asked this. The answer is no, unless you are an Irish, Malta or Cyprus citizen. The rules are the same as for a general election, when EU citizens living in the UK are not allowed to take part. So they will not get a polling card and not be on the list at the polling station. John, in London, is concerned about what will happen to house prices if Britain leaves the EU and ""millions of EU citizens need to leave"" creating a flood of available housing.  This is one of those questions where there is no clear-cut factual answer. But we can say that none of the main players are suggesting that citizens of other EU countries will be ""sent packing"" (to use John's phrase) after a Leave vote. There are a host of other variables that have an impact on property prices, including things like interest rates and the general state of the economy. But expect this to be one of those issues fought over by both sides during the campaign.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law, if the country left the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" would not necessarily disappear overnight in the event of an exit - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU would mean the UK would not be part of TTIP. It would have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU would affect the number of doctors we have and how it would impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim and found it to be dubious. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and continues to insist that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation is to get out of the EU. He says a planned trade deal between the EU and US - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - would put the NHS in ""serious danger""."
2016-05-31,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36392341,"The claim: Migration to the UK is out of control and will get worse if Britain remains in the EU. Reality Check verdict: Net migration is still at near-record levels. Just over half of it comes from outside the EU. The government has not managed to bring migration from outside the EU down to tens of thousands as the 2010 and 2015 manifestos promised, so it is not clear it would be able to do so with EU migrants post-Brexit.A lot of people are migrating to the UK, and fewer people are leaving. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures on long-term migration every three months, and these basic facts haven't changed for years. Overall net migration stands at 333,000, and has risen more than a third since David Cameron came to power in 2010, with the aim of reducing numbers to tens of thousands a year.If you exclude Brits from the figures, things look even worse for the government's targets. Last year, 373,000 more non-Brits came to live in the UK than left, a 45% increase on 2010.With the referendum fast approaching, campaigners such as Nigel Farage say that immigration can only be brought back down to the tens of thousands if we leave the EU. While the UK can decide which immigrants it accepts from outside the EU, almost anyone from within the EU is entitled to come and live here. While the rest of the EU accounts for about 6% of the world's population, it's now the source of about 49% of UK net migration. That's up from 29% five years earlier, mainly because non-EU migration has steadied off, while EU migration has increased. It may be that the accession of new EU members has fuelled that rise. Home Secretary Theresa May said last month that the EU's free movement rules make controlling immigration ""harder"". But would leaving the EU really mean immigration came crashing down? In theory, the UK could put a block on any more EU citizens coming to live here, and that could cut the net migration figures in half at a stroke. But if that were going to happen to EU migrants, why hasn't it already happened to non-EU migrants? The UK isn't bound to accept them by any international treaties, but nevertheless let 277,000 of them move over last year alone. Three quarters of immigrants move to the UK for work or study, and the ratio is much the same for EU migrants. According to figures from Oxford University, nearly 60% of EU migrants coming over for work have got a job lined up before they arrive.Also, it is possible that a deal to retain access to the single market would require the UK to maintain freedom of movement for EU citizens wanting to come here to work.Unemployment rates have been falling more or less constantly for the past five years, and if the economy remains healthy the UK is likely to need just as many workers in future.Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-05-31,John Pienaar,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/36407446,"Anyone who's followed politics for any length of time knows no party's more prone to suicidal bouts of indiscipline than the Labour Party.Unless, of course, it's the Conservative Party when it's in the mood.Just now, the Tories are in more of a mood than they've been since the chaotic days of the Major administration, and possibly since 1990, the year the party hacked down Margaret Thatcher in an orgy of political regicide prompted, naturally, by DNA-deep divisions over Europe.A surely impossible demand from any senior Conservative for David Cameron to accept his manifesto pledge to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is valueless on the ground it's ""corrosive of public trust"" - in other words because no-one believes it - would be embarrassing enough if delivered in private.Published in an open letter by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson (Gisela Stuart's a co-signatory, but Labour's internal debate is another story) it amounts to an escalation of a battle that now defies all established principles of government discipline and collective responsibility.And it does so in a way the prime minister will surely find very difficult to forgive.Harder still to overlook is the suggestion from once-favoured Employment Minister Priti Patel that the Remain campaign is led by people who are too privileged and rich, too posh, to understand the effect of mass migration on the less well off.She didn't actually name David Cameron or George Osborne, but it's not immediately apparent which other upper crust, public school and Oxbridge, multi-millionaires at the head of the Remain campaign she might have been referring to.There is a big argument at the heart of this.The Leave campaign calculates that worries about mass migration is a raw nerve which cannot be agitated too hard, or too often.It's their natural advantage, according to all public opinion research and the anecdotal evidence of countless doorstep encounters.Almost every Labour MP I meet tells me almost every voter they talk to brings it up, which I mention because Labour supporters matter hugely.Conservative voters are generally judged to lean naturally towards a ""Brexit"".In their open letter, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson's simple point is that EU open borders make immigration control impossible.The Leave campaign needs that point to hit home. The political cost of such a tactic may be high.It accelerates a descent into internecine warfare which now threatens to make the Conservative Party ungovernable if the referendum ends in anything but a decisive victory for the Remain campaign.So bitter has the conflict become, so taut the tension between the rival factions, that angry Eurosceptic Tories talk privately of challenging the prime minister's position even if Britain votes to stay inside the European Union.One of the most militant MPs, Andrew Bridgen, has gone public.He told me in an interview for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics that he believes it ""highly likely"" at least 50 Tory MPs would sign demands for a vote of no confidence in the PM if the campaign goes on as it has.More than that, he suggests the Cameron administration could be reduced to what he and others call a ""zombie government"" by its divided MPs, unable to govern and forced to consider a snap election.At Westminster, that kind of apocalyptic talk is becoming more common.Some of the whispering is - and is probably intended to be - hair-raising.I've heard it suggested that three members of the Cameron administration have become so upset by the tone of campaigning on the Remain side led by the prime minister that they are contemplating resignation, not just from the government, but from the Tory whip, effectively quitting the party.True? We may never know. But the whispering is becoming feverish.One MP on the now militant Eurosceptic wing said letters demanding a vote of confidence in the PM had already been submitted to the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, who's a sort of posh shop-steward for Conservative MPs.Mr Brady himself is bound by a sacred oath of secrecy where such matters are concerned, so we must wait to find out.The Sunday Times newspaper carries more mutinous muttering.Former Environment Secretary Owen Patterson told the paper: ""The government now has four weeks to behave properly.""If they don't, there are risks they will cause long term damage to the Conservative Party.""Another, unnamed MP, puts it more bluntly: ""When you tell Tories they are immoral for supporting Brexiteers you are going to get a kick in the nuts.""We'll see, of course. Everything depends on which side wins the referendum, and perhaps on the margin of victory.Mr Cameron insists he would carry on as prime minister if Britain votes to leave the EU.The more common view, shared among his closest supporters, is that he would be toast.If the vote is to remain an EU member, the reaction of Conservative MPs will be more a matter of chemistry than maths.Angry Eurosceptics (should we be calling them EU-rophobes?) may, or may not, be cross enough and strong enough in numbers to force a vote of confidence in the prime minister.Even then, winning that vote would be a tall order. It would need the support of 165 MPs. Not easy.More immediately worrisome, it would need a fraction of that number - just nine Tory MPs - to defeat any government vote in the Commons when combined with all opposition parties.On a realistic estimate, about 25 Conservatives are now sufficiently irate to press for a vote of no confidence in the PM.Fewer than half that number could produce the ""zombie government"" to which Andrew Bridgen referred.Ministers could be forced to discard any proposal that might meet any serious opposition, governing as if it was a minority, not a majority administration.Life would suddenly become very difficult.So a vote to remain could be a Pyrrhic victory if the margin is tight.And until we know the outcome on Friday 24 June, this self-destructive struggle is likely to intensify before it calms again - assuming, that is, the party is not already broken beyond repair."
2016-05-31,Mark Easton,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36386683,"With a month still to go, I know many British voters are already profoundly turned off by the EU referendum.The mudslinging, the rows, the nonsense - it does not always look very edifying.But I am beginning to wonder what this extraordinary plebiscite will do for our democracy in the longer term.Once the votes have all been counted, what impact will the referendum have on our respect and enthusiasm for the political process?You may be surprised to know that I think it might prove a good thing.But, then again, it could be a disaster.Faith in politicians has never been high, and pollsters report that these days only one in five of us trusts MPs to tell the truth. This figure is unlikely to have been improved by a campaign that has seen senior political figures on both sides of the debate shamelessly throw mud and dubious claims around with abandon.The BBC's Reality Check and other fact-checking organisations can help people navigate their way through some of the arguments, but their conclusions are hardly going to restore confidence in the quality of our political discourse.The UK Statistics Authority, which acts as a referee to stop politicians abusing official data, has had to intervene already.Voters tell me again and again that they just want the facts.  But the referendum has demonstrated that such things are elusive and rare. However reliable, every ""fact"" can be disputed or dismissed, its source questioned or rubbished.   George Osborne defends Treasury's gloomy EU exit forecastWould Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU referendum issues guideIn this referendum, some of our most respected institutions have found themselves accused of being self-serving or biased, prepared to twist the truth to serve their purpose.Broadcasters are used to such allegations, often from both sides of an argument simultaneously. But the Bank of England? The Institute of Fiscal Studies?  These are organisations that trade on their respected objective analysis, and it must be discombobulating to find their reputations blithely trashed on the evening news or their careful arithmetic given a D-minus in a newspaper column.What will the effect of this be after the referendum? Well, it might mean we find the truth even more elusive than it is now.If we trust no-one, what hope is there for a coherent debate about anything? It would be a tragedy if one consequence of the EU referendum campaign was to create a country where official statistics and established institutions were trusted less than the saloon-bar bore.Or it could be that we start having a more sophisticated discussion about the nature of evidence.  We may be made to think harder about the assumptions we make, the numbers we use, the conclusions we draw. And organisations that offer intelligence on such matters may be obliged to be more transparent about their methodologies and more honest about their shortcomings.Many voters are loyal to a particular party, a political tribe they rely upon to do the policy heavy-lifting and they trust to champion their cause. But the EU referendum has left them, as one undecided Tory told me in Worcestershire, all at sea. With divisions in both Conservative and Labour parties, the debate has wandered off familiar political tribal paths and into the dark jungle.If people care about the question at the centre of this referendum, and most say they do, they have to do their own homework, test the arguments themselves and make up their own mind.It may be irritating, but I do wonder whether this is actually a force for good. Blind allegiance to political parties can result in passivity and cynicism - toxic elements in the democratic process.  Passionate arguments from head and heart have been ignited by this referendum, inside political parties and often inside individual voters. And that must be positive.Politicians tell me how amazed they have been by the crowds that have turned up for referendum debates. People are thirsty for information and understanding.  A couple of weeks after a discussion for a BBC News report on the referendum, I met up again with some of our jury of undecided voters in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They all confessed to having scoured the internet for facts and figures after the first programme, and I am sure they are far from alone.Voters want simple answers - but real life is complex, and the referendum is making the electorate recognise that. Both options carry risks.The immigration debate has been crude and poorly informed for many years. But in the past few weeks, the discussion has begun to focus on the trade-offs involved, to engage with the complexity.  It feels like a much more grown-up conversation than it was.The same is true of debates about international trade, workers' rights, human rights, security and, of course, the power and propriety of the European Union itself. Our national discourse is getting down into detail we normally skate over. That must be a good thing too.The question that sits at the very heart of the referendum is also one we don't talk about enough - what kind of country do we want to be?  It is a topic that can feel irrelevant or whimsical.  But right now it feels fundamental. We know that there is deep disillusion with big party politics, the so-called Westminster elite accused of disregarding the concerns of ordinary people. It is a phenomenon replicated in many other developed Western democracies.The standing of traditional political structures is so low that in some countries tub-thumping populists can get away with making up the facts as they go along while dismissing unhelpful evidence as part of an intellectual plot. During this EU referendum campaign, some voices have got pretty close to doing the same.So the big question for our democracy and the quality of our governance is whether the referendum has further damaged respect for politics and politicians or encouraged a new wave of political engagement and understanding of complexity.One might argue that that question is just as important for the future of the UK as the EU referendum itself."

The Treasury Select Committee has criticised both sides in the EU Referendum campaign for peddling ""misleading"" figures and ""implausible assumptions"".Its chair, Andrew Tyrie, told BBC News: ""What we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides.""The Reality Check team has been keeping an eye on how both sides have been using numbers throughout the campaign. Here are a few from each side.Andrew Tyrie cited the claim that the UK sends £350m a week to Brussels and it could be spent on the NHS instead as particularly problematic. The claim ignores the rebate, which means that amount of money is not sent to Brussels each week. Also, some of the money is returned to the UK to be spent on things like farming subsidies and regional development, and Leave campaigners have not suggested these payments should stop.The claim, which appears on the Vote Leave bus, has also been criticised repeatedly by the UK Statistics Authority. Its chair, Sir Andrew Dilnot, said on Friday he was ""disappointed"" the figure was still being used.You can read the full Reality Check on the £350m claim here. And there is a discussion of why all the money could not be spent on the NHS here.Another claim criticised was the government's suggestion that leaving the EU could cost your family £4,300.The committee pointed out that this was confusing GDP per household with household income and expressed disappointment that so much emphasis had been placed on this figure.You can read Reality Check's take on the £4,300 claim here.The committee's report also said: ""It is misleading to claim, as some campaign groups continue to do, that three million jobs are dependent on EU membership.The Reality Check team covered the Prime Minister saying this, and also David Milliband using a variation on it.You can read about Mr Milliband's assertion that 100,000 jobs in the North East are dependent on the EU here.The committee criticised the claim that the Common Agricultural Policy costs £400 per household per year as being based on out-of-date research. It also questioned how much of that money could be saved by leaving the EU.You'll find discussion of the figure as part of this selection of claims made by Boris Johnson.The committee criticised the Treasury's failure to get its analysis on the short-term consequences of leaving the EU to it in time to include it as part of the report.It described the delays as ""highly unsatisfactory"" and inconsistent with commitments made to the committee by the Chancellor.You can read the Reality Check assessment of the year-long recession claim made by the Treasury here.The Vote Leave claim that the cost of EU regulations was £33.3bn a year or £600m a week was described in the report as a ""tendentious representation of the research on which it is based"".The figure, which came from Open Europe, was an assessment of the cost of complying with the 100 most ""burdensome"" regulations.You can read more about the £600m claim on regulation here.Andrew Tyrie told BBC News that the report had been accepted unanimously by the committee, despite it containing prominent figures from both sides of the debate.""This is unanimous - they accepted what's in the report,"" he said.

2016-05-31,Is it 'workin'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380007,"The battle between the Remain and Leave sides in the EU referendum is in full swing and social media is being used by both camps to try to win the race.Younger voters have so far been slower to register to vote and campaigners are keen to win their attention and support.Some strategies have enjoyed surprise success while others have misfired completely. The Britain Stronger in Europe group launched a social media campaign about young people ""ravin"", ""shoppin"" and ""chattin"" and then urging them to #stayin (the EU). It was spoofed for dropping the 'g' and was seen by some as being patronising to young people.The company behind the campaign is VentureThree and its spokesman TJ Rees told the BBC: ""Traditional advertising and branding is typically done in isolation but with social media, once it is out there you have no control. This is positive and more democratic but it is also, by definition, unpredictable.""Mandy Boylett, a UKIP parliamentary candidate and committed Leave campaigner, produced a homemade video showing two versions of herself dressed in the union jack and singing a reworked cover of the England football anthem, Three Lions.The video, including lyrics like: ""They want prisoners to vote, They've taken all our fish and money through the years. There's regulations, red tape. It seems there's no escape 'til the Leave vote takes shape"" was listened to by Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike and was an instant success on Facebook and Twitter.""I was completely overwhelmed,"" said Boylett, ""It went absolutely mad in the first 24 hours and went all over the world. There is something appealing to somebody in an unofficial capacity just having a go.""A group of Europeans living in the UK - who cannot vote in the referendum - wanted to show that they want the UK to stay in the EU.Christine Ullman is a German digital marketer. She has been living in London for seven years and is co-creator of the Please Don't Go UK initiative. ""It had to be a positive message,"" she said, ""We didn't want to tell people what to think about the EU but we wanted to express our love for our chosen homeland.""The group started the #HugaBrit campaign in which they invited fellow Europeans in the UK to share pictures of themselves embracing British friends, lovers and colleagues. One woman even posted a picture of herself hugging a statue of writer Virginia Woolf and, as well as enjoying social media success, the campaign also made it into the mainstream print press. ""We have received a lot of positive feedback and even people who are pro-Brexit have reached out to us to say they like [our] campaign',"" says Ullman. An unlikely ambassador for the Remain group is a lizard-chasing dog from Mallorca called Anton, who has 10,200 followers on Instagram and the picture below is the second most debated photograph related to the EU referendum on the social network - according to research by the Oxford Internet Institute.Anton says: ""Hola citizens of the UK. Don't lose your low-cost flights and access to Vitamin D - #voteyes stay with us in the EU! We love you.""Anton's Instagram fame shows how unpredictable social media is and the reaction to #Votin also illustrates how unforgiving an environment it can be.

At the moment, EU players have the freedom to participate in British football, while non-EU players have to have a work permit in order to play in the Premier League. We don't know what deal would be cut in the event of Brexit, but we can look at the situation for non-EU players at the moment as an indication of the direction things might take. For non-EU players to be granted a work permit, they must demonstrate they are an international player of ""the highest calibre."" This means they must have played in 75% of a Fifa top-50 ranked national team's matches over the previous two years.The Home Office made it harder for non-EU players to get work visas last year, a move which the FA (Football Association) hoped would give more opportunities for home-grown talent to rise to the top.FA chairman Greg Dyke said at the time that if the new system had been applied over the previous five years, there would have been 42 fewer non-European players in the Premier and Football Leagues. If this kind of reduction was replicated for EU players following a British exit, this would leave vacancies on British teams. Indeed, the BBC's Matt Slater has suggested only 23 of the 180 non-British EU players currently playing in the Championship would get work permits. In theory, those 157 remaining spots could be filled by British players.But clubs would still be able to recruit the best players from around the world. A 2014 FA report suggested while Spanish, French and German players featured heavily in Champions League games, Brazilian players were also a major source of competition, with more than twice as many as English players appearing in any Champions League group stage games in 2013. Vacancies left by ""non-elite"" EU players could be filled by Brits, or they could be filled or by other, more elite international players. Whether home clubs would focus their attentions on attracting the top international players who would remain eligible for work permits, or on giving opportunities to British footballers following a Brexit is likely to depend on factors unrelated to the EU - such as the quality of coaching and the strength of the British talent pool.

2016-05-31,Who's who: Shadow Cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20160530161649/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband.
