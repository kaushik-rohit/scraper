2016-11-01,Brexit case 'bid to block voters' will',https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37866411,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA High Court case that could delay the Brexit process is ""a clear attempt to frustrate the will of the British people"", says a cabinet minister.Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC One's Question Time the referendum result had been ""very, very clear"" and politicians should ""get on with that"".But three judges ruled that the PM could not trigger the formal Brexit process without Parliament's backing.The Supreme Court is expected to hear the government's appeal next month.Prime Minister Theresa May is due to speak to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker by phone on Friday to say she intends to stick to her March 2017 deadline for triggering Article 50.Addressing Thursday's ruling on Question Time, Mr Javid said the vast majority of MPs had backed legislation to bring forward a referendum on the UK's EU membership in 2015 and the public had clearly voted in favour of leaving the EU.He said there was a ""moral issue"" at stake: ""It was a clear result, clear instructions were issued... by the British people to their politicians saying: We need a decision. Now it's our job as politicians to get on with it.""He said he was not criticising the judges, but the people who brought the case: ""This is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable.""But for Labour, Lisa Nandy told the programme: ""Britain is leaving the EU and whether or not Parliament has to vote to trigger Article 50, this will happen because, in reality, there are no more than a handful of parliamentarians who would seek to block that decision.""In the landmark ruling, the High Court judges said the government could not trigger the Article 50 process of formally leaving the European Union alone - they must have the approval of Parliament. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the ruling as a ""massive obstacle"" for Mrs May, who says she wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. If the government loses in the Supreme Court, it will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on. MPs could then push to set the terms for negotiating withdrawal and it could face further delays in the Lords.The prime minister's spokeswoman has played down suggestions that Mrs May may call an early general election if she cannot get Parliamentary support, saying that Mrs May believed ""there shouldn't be an election until 2020 and that remains her view"".Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC the result of the EU referendum ""must be respected"".""Parliament voted by six to one to give the decision to the people, no ifs or buts, and that's why we are appealing this to get on with delivering the best deal for Britain."" But Gina Miller, the lead claimant in bringing the case to the High Court, urged the government to ""do the responsible sober thing, which is to do the job we pay them for, to debate all the aspects to do with leaving and then have a vote"".By Eleanor Garnier, BBC political correspondent It is one of the most important constitutional court cases in generations.  And the result creates a nightmare scenario for the government.  Theresa May had said she wanted to start Brexit talks before the end of March next year but this ruling has thrown the prime minister's timetable up in the air.  Campaigners who brought the case insist it was about ""process not politics"", but behind the doors of No 10 there will now be serious head-scratching about what the government's next steps should be. This decision has huge implications, not just on the timing of Brexit but on the terms of Brexit. That's because it's given the initiative to those on the Remain side in the House of Commons who, it's now likely, will argue Article 50 can only be triggered when Parliament is ready and that could mean when they're happy with the terms of any future deal.  Of course, it will be immensely difficult to satisfy and get agreement from all those MPs who voted to remain. Could an early general election be on the cards after all? She rejected criticism that the case was subverting democracy and said it was ""not about politics, this was about process"".""One of the big arguments [in the referendum[ was parliamentary sovereignty... so you can't on the day you get back sovereignty decide you're going to sidestep or throw it away.""The government had argued it could use ancient prerogative powers to give effect ""to the will of the people"".But the three judges looking at the case found there was no constitutional convention of the royal prerogative - powers used by ministers - being used in legislation relating to the EU.They added that triggering Article 50 would fundamentally change UK people's rights - and that the government cannot change or do away with rights under UK law unless Parliament gives it authority to do so. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he feared a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who had backed leaving the EU in June's referendum.""We are heading for a half-Brexit,"" he said.""I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand... I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This ruling underlines the need for the government to bring its negotiating terms to Parliament without delay. Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to Parliament on the terms of Brexit.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told the BBC: ""What the government was seeking to do was to impose a deal that absolutely nobody voted for, that most people who voted to leave wouldn't be happy with and most people who voted to remain wouldn't be happy with, without any kind of Parliamentary scrutiny. ""So it's a terrible shame it had to go to the courts, but what has happened is that democracy and sovereignty have been restored.""The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The EU's other 27 member states have said negotiations about the terms of the UK's exit - due to last two years - cannot begin until Article 50 has been invoked.What questions do you have about the Article 50 High Court ruling?"
2016-11-01,Will Brexit struggles mean early election?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37861456,"The three bewigged government lawyers looked glum as the clock ticked towards 10 in Court Four in the Royal Courts of Justice.They had good reason to. The High Court chucked out the government's argument that they had the power to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs.That's a serious problem for Theresa May, who wanted to be able to start the legal machinations of Article 50 without the hassle and political risk of going through Parliament.MPs have already shown they are willing to be difficult over Brexit, or flex every muscle of scrutiny (depending which way you look at it). And with a tiny majority in Parliament and most MPs having argued Remain, this judgement spells real trouble for ministers.An emboldened Parliament is the last thing Mrs May needs when faced with the enormous complexities of taking us out of the EU. But sovereignty is what the country voted for in the referendum. The High Court says that Parliament's sovereignty is what we've got.The legal process will now grind on. The government is appealing at the Supreme Court. But the machinations could well delay the government's plans and, with a braver Parliament able to make life more difficult, might the temptation of an early election become too much to resist?The only way of making this headache go away could be a general election."

The ruling means the UK government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own.It is appealing to the Supreme Court, with a further hearing due next month.The case, which was heard by three judges, is widely regarded as being one of the most important constitutional rulings in generations.The Scottish government had instructed legal representatives to observe the proceedings, but was not directly involved. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the House of Commons the government was ""disappointed"" but remained ""determined to respect the result"" of the EU referendum.Speaking at first minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the ruling would not have come as a huge surprise to anyone who had been following the case. She added: ""We will be looking at the judgement very carefully, and yes we will actively consider whether or not there is a case for the Scottish government to become participants in that case.""The first minister also said the ruling was ""hugely significant and underlines the total chaos and confusion at the heart of the UK government"".She claimed the UK government had attempted to avoid a vote by MPs because ""they don't have a coherent position and they know that if they take their case to the House of Commons that will be exposed.""Ms Sturgeon also reiterated that she was determined to protect Scotland's place in Europe and in the single market ""as far as I possibly can"".She added: ""SNP MPs in the House of Commons will certainly not vote for anything that undermines the will or the interests of the Scottish people.""Responding to the ruling, Scottish Labour Europe spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: ""This ruling shows that the Tories can't get away with ""Brexit means Brexit"" any more. ""Theresa May must put her negotiating objectives in front of parliament as soon as possible, and respect both the judgement of the court and the vital role of parliament in a democratic country.""BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said, if the court's decision was not overturned, there could be delays with potentially ""months and months"" of parliamentary hurdles.But there was not yet ""clarity"" - if the judgement was not overturned - on whether there would be a ""short, sharp"" vote or whether parliament would have to consider complex legislation, he added.He predicted that, although a majority of MPs had backed the Remain campaign, most would ultimately be likely to vote for Article 50, as Brexit had been supported in the referendum.UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said he fears a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who backed leaving the EU in June's referendum and voiced concern at the prospect of a ""half Brexit""."

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing due in December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its end of March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go ahead for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit.Theresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the Eu. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should seek to end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament,"" he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-01,'Mistake' to fight Brexit court ruling,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-37858844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkChallenging a High Court ruling that MPs should be consulted over leaving the EU would be a mistake, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.Judges said the UK government could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without Parliamentary approval.  UK ministers are to appeal, pointing to the referendum result and existing ministerial powers.Pro-Brexit Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called the judges' decision an ""unnecessary distraction"".But Mr Jones said the ruling was ""extremely clear"" that ""the UK Government cannot trigger Article 50 using the Crown prerogative"". ""Indeed, this is consistent with many of the arguments made by the Leave campaign themselves about Parliamentary sovereignty. ""It is a mistake, in my view, to challenge such a clear ruling and we should now try and move ahead to develop a fuller understanding of the UK Government's position. ""The position of the Welsh Government has been consistent throughout - we accept the decision made by the people and will not work against the referendum result - we are working hard to get the best possible exit terms for Wales. ""However, it is important that votes take place in all four nations to endorse the UK negotiating position.""Plaid Cymru's Brexit spokesman, MP Jonathan Edwards, welcomed the High Court ruling and called for the Welsh Assembly and other UK parliaments to have a say on the terms of Brexit as well as the timing.""The people of Wales voted to leave the European Union and we must respect that decision, but nobody has voted for a 'hard Brexit',"" he said. ""Being dragged out of the single market and the customs union as well as the European Union will devastate the Welsh economy and we will continue to resist any attempts to do so.""However, Mr Davies said: ""A clear majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union in June, and Parliament's job is to enact that decision - not to subvert it. ""The people have spoken and their decision must be respected.  ""Parliament had its say when the referendum was approved by an Act of Parliament. There is no basis for a further vote in Parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.""Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.""This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours."""
2016-11-01,NI parties split on potential Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-37857141,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNorthern Ireland's political parties remain sharply divided over Brexit ahead of a possible Westminster vote.The largest party, the DUP, described a High Court ruling that said Parliament must vote before the UK government can trigger Article 50 to leave the EU as ""disappointing"".But, DUP leader Arlene Foster said Brexit would still happen.Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said he has ""no faith"" that MPs will respect Northern Ireland's referendum result.Overall, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU, but in Northern Ireland, a majority of people (56%), voted to stay.Thursday's High Court ruling was a defeat for the Westminster government, but it will now appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.The SDLP's Mark Durkan said his party's three MPs would ""unapologetically defend the will of the 56% of people who voted to remain in the European Union"".The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which has two seats in the House of Commons,  said its MPs would vote in support of the UK-wide result. With eight seats, the DUP is the joint-fourth largest party in the Commons and is strongly in favour of leaving the EU.""On 23 June, the British people as a whole gave a clear mandate for the UK government to leave the EU,"" DUP MP Nigel Dodds said. ""There must be no attempt to block Brexit by people who refuse to accept the will of the people of the UK.""His party leader Arlene Foster has said the ruling will not stop Brexit from happening.She said it was ""clear"" that the UK government was going in a direction that represented the views of the majority of people who voted for the UK to leave the EU.Sinn Féin has four MPs but the party does not take its seats in the House of Commons under a long-held policy of abstentionism.At a Stormont press conference, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was asked if his party would change its policy if there was a ""crucial vote"" on Brexit.He replied that he had already seen a statement from the Labour Party which said it intended to respect the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum result.Labour has 231 seats in the House of Commons, meaning it would be unlikely that Sinn Féin's four MPs could have much influence on the vote.However, Mr McGuinness said any decision to leave the EU would affect the whole island of Ireland.""Brexit will have a massive impact on every one of Ireland's 32 counties,"" he said. ""So we believe that any decisions that need to be taken about the future of this island [should] be taken between our administration in the north and the government in Dublin.""He added: ""As far as I'm concerned, the assembly and the Dáil [Irish parliament] are the people who make the decisions about the future of the people who live in this island.""However, Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister} Enda Kenny said the decision of the High Court in London was a matter for the British government. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Irish government needed to find alternatives to Brexit, and called on all interested parties to work to ensure Northern Ireland is given special status.""The European Union can be quite flexible about making those types of arrangements, and the Irish government needs to be pursuing that position,"" added Mr Adams.Sinn Féin's nationalist rivals, the SDLP, do take their seats at Westminster and the party welcomed the High Court ruling. Mr Durkan said: ""I have consistently called on the government not to begin the formal process of triggering Article 50 on withdrawal from the EU until its proposals have been fully considered in the House of Commons and voted upon by MPs.""He claimed it was now ""incumbent on other MPs from Northern Ireland to commit to representing the democratically stated will of people here"".The UUP's statement said: ""Parliament voted to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to vote in a straight in/out referendum.""On the 23rd June the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and on that basis, should the appeal be unsuccessful, our MPs will vote to trigger Article 50.""The Alliance party does not have any MPs but its Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry also welcomed the ruling.""This at least now provides an opportunity for Parliamentary and Assembly scrutiny of the issues around Brexit,"" he said.  Mr Farry added that the UK government needs ""to spell out much more clearly what they intend Brexit to mean""."
2016-11-01,Prisons to undergo 'major overhaul',https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37854358,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAn extra 2,100 prison officers are to be recruited to ease staffing shortages in jails in England and Wales, Justice Secretary Liz Truss will say later.  Unveiling a White Paper, Ms Truss will say the new recruits should help to reduce attacks on staff and prisoners.She will detail plans for more autonomy for governors and ensure drug tests for inmates when they enter and leave jail.But Labour said the speech would be a ""blatant PR stunt"" unless comprehensive plans to address staff cuts were made.Since 2010, prison officer numbers have fallen from about 25,000 to 18,000.At the same time, the number of prisoners has risen slightly.  The extra officers, costing £100m a year, will not restore staffing to the levels seen before 2010. How dangerous are our prisons?The debate around escalating levels of violence, suicide and self-harm in prisons has increasingly focused on staff shortages.  Union leaders warned on Wednesday that prisons were facing bloodbaths unless more staff were recruited and retained.Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers Association, said proper staffing levels were needed if officers - not inmates - were to be in charge of jails.Warnings also came from prisoners on the inside, with one inmate at London's Pentonville telling the BBC that knives are flown in by drones and razors are melted into toothbrushes to make weapons.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said Ms Truss needed to ""regain the trust of prison governors and prison officers"" with her speech.""The reduction by 25% of frontline prison officers mean those that remain are overstretched, overwhelmed and without support,"" he said.""Without a comprehensive plan to deal with these issues then her speech will be nothing more than empty words and a blatant PR stunt.""The latest figures show a new high of 65 assaults in jails every day.In the year to June, assaults on staff jumped by 43% to 5,954, with 697 of these recorded as serious.Other measures expected to be laid out in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper include:Last month, Ms Truss announced an extra 400 prison officers would be recruited, which means there will be 2,500 new recruits joining the service altogether.BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was a significant increase though it would still leave staff numbers below the 2010 level. In echoes of her predecessor Michael Gove's reform plans, Ms Truss is also planning to give governors more say over how their prisons are run and make sure they are held to account for levels of reoffending and drug misuse. If jails are assessed to be failing, the justice secretary will have a new legal duty to intervene."
2016-11-01,Philip Green pension offer £100m short,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37854657,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkSir Philip Green is offering £100m less than the Pension Regulator is seeking to plug a gap in the BHS pension scheme. The BBC understands that the regulator wants £350m in redress from Sir Philip, who is offering £250m.The regulator launched enforcement action against Sir Philip and other former owners of BHS after failing to agree a deal over pensions.Sir Philip says he had presented ""a credible and substantial proposal"".The regulator is looking for redress for BHS's 20,000 pension scheme members following an investigation into the matter.It has sent warning notices to Sir Philip, his retail group, and Dominic Chappell, who was the owner when the department store chain collapsed.The 300-page notices could see the billionaire being ordered to pay more towards the pension shortfall, which had swollen to nearly £600m by the time BHS went out of business.""I have read the statement from the Pensions Regulator this evening and noted its contents,"" Sir Philip said.His new proposal had evidence of ""cash availability"", could take the scheme out of the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund (PPF), and ""achieve a better outcome for the BHS pensioners"", he said.""I have also spoken to the chairman of the [BHS pension] trustees who is supportive of the proposal on the basis that it provides members with better benefits than they would receive from the PPF,"" Sir Philip added.MPs last month backed a call to strip Sir Philip of his knighthood for his role in the collapse of BHS, which closed just over a year after he sold it for £1 to Mr Chappell, a former racing car driver. The decision on his knighthood would have to be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee.During months of talks Sir Philip has declined to publicly put a number on the level of financial support he would be willing to give the pension schemes.Four and a half months after Sir Philip Green said he'd ""sort"" the BHS pension deficit, the regulator has seemingly lost patience. It has warned Sir Philip and brief owner Dominic Chappell it thinks there is a strong case for them to be forced to help plug the £600m hole in the scheme. Sir Philip hit back saying he had tabled a substantial proposal that would provide a better result for the 20,000 members than the reduced benefits offered by the pensions lifeboat scheme and one that had the backing of the chairman of the BHS pension trustees. The regulator said the door remained open for an improved offer but failing that, an independent panel would decide whether the evidence against Sir Philip and others is strong enough to force them to pay up and determine how much. That panel will meet sometime next year. Any decision can be appealed against and even if Sir Philip is eventually forced to pay, it is likely any money will go to soften the hit to the Pension Protection Fund rather than directly to the BHS pensioners.Read Simon's blog in fullLesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: ""Our decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.""  Frank Field, who co-chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS, said: ""We are not surprised that the Pensions Regulator has, like all the rest of us, lost patience with Sir Philip Green's excuses and empty promises.""Iain Wright, the other chairman of the inquiry, said that five months after Sir Philip told MPs he would ""sort out the pensions mess"" he has put ""no credible plan or cash on the table"". ""We have seen stalling for time, lack of real progress in the negotiations and that's why the regulator has to do what it has done - understandable, regrettable, but I can perfectly understand what's been going on,"" he told the BBC.Mr Wright also pointed out that while BHS stores have been closing, staff have been losing their jobs and worrying about their pensions ""he takes ownership of his third yacht and spends his summer in the Med. That level of inequality really rankles with people"".The Pensions Regulator opened an investigation into the BHS pension situation in March 2015.It said it has now launched enforcement action after reviewing almost 100,000 documents and holding talks with various BHS stakeholders.Sir Philip and the other recipients of the notices will have an opportunity to reply.It could then be sent to an independent determinations panel, which can impose a financial order that the regulator and former owners must then agree.Independent pensions expert John Ralfe said it was likely to be a very long process that could end up being dragged through the highest courts.A separate case has been stuck at stage one - the enforcement notice - for three years, he told the BBC."

After loud laughter from the audience, he clarified his comments, saying Brexit would be a ""colossal success"". The annual ceremony from the magazine awarded Mr Johnson the political comeback of the year prize.Accepting it, he said: ""In the words of our great prime minister... I understood that Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a Titanic success of it.""Landale: Can PM stop mocking Boris?But it was not just Mr Johnson getting the laughs. Prime Minister Theresa May paid sartorial tribute to former chancellor George Osborne, appearing alongside him wearing a hard hat and high-visibility jacket as she accepted her politician of the year prize.The apparel was much favoured by Mr Osborne during his cabinet days for official visits to factories and large-scale infrastructure projects.As she accepted her award, the prime minister told the audience: ""Oh, come on. We're all builders now.""Mr Osborne was the guest of honour, using his speech to mock himself and his party colleagues as he handed out his own ""real parliamentary awards"". His self-styled ""Sam Allardyce campaign manager of the year award"" went to Michael Gove -  who Mr Osborne said ""made up with the quantity of his leadership campaigns what they lacked in quality"".He gave his ""President Erdogan prize for the attempted coup that makes the leader stronger"" to the entire parliamentary Labour Party, referring to the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader in September. Mr Osborne later presented Mrs May with her politician of the year award. Accepting it, Mrs May added a dig over Mr Osborne's warnings on behalf of the Remain campaign ahead of the Brexit referendum.She said: ""I'm particularly pleased to receive this award from George, because I gather that when it came to the voting it actually got very tight and I owe it to George that he just nudged me over the line - because he told the other members of the jury that if they didn't vote for me, the economy would collapse and World War Three would start.""Mrs May also joked about Sir Craig Oliver, former director of communications for her predecessor, David Cameron.She said: ""I understand that in his book about the referendum campaign, Craig says that, when he heard the result of the referendum, he walked out of the office, he walked out into Whitehall and he started retching violently.""I have to say, I think we all know that feeling. Most of us experienced it too - when we saw his name on the resignation honours list.""But she changed the tone by raising a toast to Mr Cameron, who recently stood down as an MP."

I'd say so,"" Cavendish wrote in his four-star review.""Given the current, high levels of concern about immigration and how long a shadow that speech has cast, [this was] a depressingly necessary evening.""The production is partly set in 1992 and sees Caribbean immigrant Rose Cruickshank confront the MP about his views.The play also flashes back to 1960s to see the influences that shaped the two main characters.Ann Treneman of The Times also gave the show four stars, adding that McDiarmid ""gives a standout performance"".""This play does not mince words,"" she wrote. ""Some are offensive, yet [writer] Chris Hannan isn't interested in political correctness but in getting to the core of a story.""Not just about Powell but of England - what does it mean to be English and who exactly are we anyway?""The Financial Times described the play as ""compelling"" in its four-star review, while The Stage said the production was ""timely and intelligent"".Michael Billington gave the production a slightly less warm review in The Guardian, awarding it three stars.""While Hannan makes it clear that we are still obsessed with immigration and the nature of Englishness, his play is much better at exploring the paradoxes of Powell than those of the surrounding culture,"" he wrote.Referring to the two main characters, he added: ""Powell, whatever you think of him, is complex. His principal antagonist, Rose, is simply confusing.""WhatsOnStage also gave the show three stars. ""Hannan brings history back to life: a black and white photo recoloured. It sheds light on the present,"" wrote Matt Trueman.""Hannan's structure sets up eloquent and forceful head-to-heads, but in giving space to vital debates, each strand gives up its narrative drive.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

2016-11-01,UKIP leadership: Runners and riders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37567690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUKIP is holding a fresh leadership contest after the recently-elected Diane James unexpectedly quit after 18 days in the post. Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-01,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."
2016-11-01,Gina Miller profile,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37861888,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkInvestment manager Gina Miller has been the lead claimant in the case to get Parliament to vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU - but who is she?Ms Miller, 51, is an investment manager and philanthropist who was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain, co-founding the investment firm SCM Private in 2009.She launched True and Fair with her hedge fund manager husband, Alan, which campaigns against mis-selling and hidden fund charges in the City of London's fund management industry. According to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the ""black-widow spider"".Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.""Her charity, the True and Fair Foundation, formerly known as Miller Philanthropy, was launched in 2009.The foundation says it supports smaller charities by providing funding and support. Charity Commission records show it spent £135,982 in 2015.Ms Miller launched the Brexit legal case along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the caseMs Miller has argued that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.But she has stressed throughout that the challenge is not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now.""Speaking after the High Court announced its verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"".  She said: ""What we're saying is, very simply, you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about getting back a sovereign Parliament and being in control but at the same time then bypass it.""Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.""This case is far more fundamental than that. ""It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament. ""We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship."""
2016-11-01,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37860618,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe claim: The High Court ruling that the government cannot use prerogative powers to trigger Article 50 could scupper Brexit.Reality check verdict: The process of obtaining parliamentary approval may delay or complicate the process but it is hard to imagine that Parliament could ignore the outcome of the referendum.The High Court has ruled that the government does not have the power to trigger Article 50 - to start formal exit negotiations with the EU - without the approval of Parliament.The ruling was made by two of the UK's most senior judges, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls and another experienced colleague, Lord Justice Sales. The government is appealing to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case in early December.Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who sits on the Committee on exiting the European Union, told BBC News: ""A lot of people... will be shocked to see a very small group of people go to court and effectively seek the form of redress, which could end up scuppering a referendum.""He later went on to say that he did not think the ruling would stop Brexit happening.The government currently plans to trigger Article 50 in March 2017 and this timetable may be threatened.If the Supreme Court rules in late December or January that the approval of Parliament is needed then it would be more difficult for that to happen in time for March.But prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC News: ""I don't think this affects the timetable at all."" However, he did warn that it opened the possibility of Parliament voting against Article 50 being triggered, causing a constitutional crisis. The High Court did not specify what form the approval of Parliament has to take but there is broad consensus that it would have to be an Act of Parliament. Passing that legislation could be complicated and time-consuming because it would require there to be debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, allowing there to be amendments tabled that could, for example, limit the government's freedom in negotiations about the UK's future relationship with the EU.It is possible that this could delay the triggering of Article 50 beyond March, but could it scupper Brexit altogether?If all the MPs voted in the way that they campaigned in the referendum then there would be a Commons majority for staying in the EU, but it is enormously unlikely that they would decide to ignore the outcome of the referendum.Labour's shadow secretary for exiting the European Union, Keir Starmer, was very clear in telling BBC News: ""We accept and respect the outcome of the referendum.""But he added that the court ruling should force the government to set out the outline principles on which it would be negotiating."
2016-11-01,James Landale,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37863003,"Theresa May is going to have to start taking Boris Johnson seriously if she wants the world to do likewise. Last night I sat on the same table as the foreign secretary at the Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. He was given a gong for ""comeback of the year"" after his failed leadership bid propelled him into King Charles Street. Mr Johnson gave a typically self-deprecatory speech, saying he hoped he would last longer than Lord Heseltine's mother's dog, Kim, which survived partial strangulation by the Tory peer only later to be put down. He spoke about the need to press on with Brexit, which he described as taking ""the machete of freedom to the brambles of EU legislation"". He told a funny story about how he had recently caused confusion at a dinner with EU colleagues in Bratislava: he said Brexit Britain would support the EU from the outside, like a flying buttress; the interpreters translated this as a ""flying bucket"".And of course, there was the inevitable verbal slip when he promised that Brexit would be a ""titantic success"", a classicist's reference to the mythological giants rather than the ill-fated ship.Then the prime minister got to her feet. I shall pass over her venomous assault on Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former communications chief, except to note that several senior Tories were stunned by her lack of grace. One - almost speechless - said it was the most unprimeministerial thing they had ever heard. But it was what Mrs May said about Boris Johnson that struck me most. Picking up on his reference to Lady Heseltine's aggressive Alsatian, the prime minister looked directly at her foreign secretary - I was directly in the eye line - and said: ""Boris, the dog was put down... (pause)...  when its master decided it wasn't needed any more.""It was a funny line. And we laughed. But it also struck me what a barbed line it was too. It was a warning as much as a joke, a threat of political euthanasia for a colleague if he stepped out of line.I also noted that this was, yet another, occasion when the prime minister had chosen to mock her foreign secretary in public. At the start of her conference speech last month, before the serried ranks of Tory faithful, Mrs May said there were many questions hanging in the air, including: ""Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days?... (pause)... just about.""Now every government has a court jester and Boris Johnson will never be able to escape that title. But his role in this government is crucial. He is there to convince the international community that Britain is not turning its back on the world post Brexit, that Britain has a positive role to play in global affairs.And to do that he needs to be taken seriously. Many foreign politicians and diplomats that I speak to tell me they are pleasantly surprised when they meet the foreign secretary for the first time. They talk of the man behind the caricature - the cultured, over-educated intellectual who often speaks a bit of their language and who can be thoughtful when he is not gripped by banter. The problem is that many others - who have not met the foreign secretary in person - often still see him as a kind of upmarket Nigel Farage, a Eurosceptic clown with clout. So to do his job, Britain's diplomat-in-chief needs of every bit of credibility he can lay his hands on. He is already the butt of many jokes. The last thing he needs is his prime minister adding to the mirth."
2016-11-01,Not irreversible,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Scottish cross-bench peer who wrote Article 50 - the procedure by which the UK would leave the EU - believed it was ""not irrevocable"". In a BBC interview, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard said the UK could choose to stay in the EU even after exit negotiations had begun. He has also renewed calls for either parliament or the public to be given a chance to stop Brexit. The UK government insisted the leave vote must be respected. His comments come as the High Court is to rule on whether the government can begin the formal process of leaving the European Union without consulting Parliament.Prime Minister Theresa May said she would trigger the two year exit negotiation process by the end of March 2017. This procedure, which is described in Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, should ensure the UK leaves the EU in 2019. But Lord Kerr, who devised the clause, said the country ""might want to think again"" when Brexit terms become clearer. He explained: ""It is not irrevocable.""You can change your mind while the process is going on. ""During that period, if a country were to decide actually we don't want to leave after all, everybody would be very cross about it being a waste of time. ""They might try to extract a political price but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.""Lord Kerr wants either parliament or the public - through an election or a second referendum - to revisit the decision to leave the EU in a year to 18 months time. Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out reversing the result of the EU referendum vote which took place on 23 June and resulted in 52% of UK voters backing the campaign to leave. Lord Kerr is advising First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon on Brexit as she seeks to maintain Scotland's links with the EU. He does not think it would be possible for Scotland to remain in the EU single market if the UK as a whole is leaving. However, he said different arrangements for access to the single market for different parts of the UK could be possible. Lord Kerr said: ""It is possible to envisage the Scots being in an ante room to the council [of EU ministers] in Brussels, rather closer to the action than the English might be on particular subjects.""The former diplomat also said that he does not believe a vote for independence would secure Scotland unbroken membership of the EU. ""I think that when independent the Scots could apply and probably get in pretty quickly through the door marked accession. But they can't stay inside,"" he said. When Lord Kerr argued a similar case during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign, the Scottish government insisted that the EU would find a way of accommodating Scotland.  Although the UK as a whole chose to leave the EU in the referendum ballot, voters in Scotland decided by 62% to 38% to stay.Lord Kerr is a former head of the British diplomatic service and served as both UK ambassador to the EU and the United States. After leaving the foreign office, he was secretary-general of the European convention, which drafted what became the Lisbon treaty. It included Article 50 which sets out the process by which any member state can leave the EU. Lord Kerr said the process ""wasn't really necessary"" because it has always been possible for a country to quit. He added: ""If you stopped paying the bills and you stopped turning up at the meetings, in due course your friends would notice that you seemed to have left.""Lord Kerr said he had never imagined the UK would make use of Article 50. He explained: ""I thought the circumstances in which it would be used, if ever, would be when there was a coup in a member state and the EU suspended that country's membership. ""I thought that at that point the dictator in question might be so cross that he'd say 'right, I'm off' and it would be good to have a procedure under which he could leave."" A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""The UK voted to leave the European Union. The people have spoken and it is now the duty of the government to make sure that happens.""Government lawyers also made clear in legal proceedings before the High Court that, as a matter of firm policy, notification of withdrawal will not be withdrawn."""

In the longer term, in the event that the standing of the City of London were to be diminished, there is concern as to how much will be available in this jurisdiction, where people should be locating, where they should be qualifying and so on.""The society is also warning that uncertainty at the outcome of the 23 June referendum could mean the position of England and Wales as the ""global legal centre"" comes under threat from rivals including New York and Singapore.Mr Bourns said global businesses choose the legal system of England and Wales to resolve disputes but this status could be undermined as the UK plots its post-Brexit course.""Competing jurisdictions are saying English and Welsh law is not as useful as it used to be and perhaps you'd like to use a different jurisdiction,"" he told the BBC.The legal industry employs 370,000 people across England and Wales with a turnover of £26bn - and ""anything that goes towards undermining that would be a problem"", he says.The society also fears multi-national law firms will be damaged by the loss of an EU directive allowing solicitors to work in other member states, saying this could mean complicated negotiations with authorities in each country they operate in.Bad news for England and Wales could be good news for Ireland, where the Law Society is reporting a surge in the numbers of solicitors and barristers applying to practice.MPs are beginning an inquiry into the implications of Brexit  on the justice system, including a focus on the European Arrest Warrant, which the Law Society says must be retained.Once Article 50 negotiations are complete, and the UK leaves, lawyers are likely to be kept busy by the government's Great Repeal Bill, with which it plans to incorporate all EU regulations into UK law, before picking and choosing the ones it wants to keep.""It's absolutely vast,"" said Mr Bourns.""We've been members of the EU for 43 years. There are about 350 directives that are presently in the course of implementation. So what happens to those?""He predicted a ""role for the courts"" in settling disputes about whether EU or UK rules applied in different situations, and questioned what would happen when EU legislation is amended by Brussels after it has been incorporated into UK law.As for what the UK decides to keep, he said the challenge would be to ""ensure we don't inadvertently miss something that means we're disadvantaged"".""Lawyers are very much involved, there's no doubt about that.""Clients are asking, and clients are planning. So there's a lot of work to be done.""But aren't lawyers just talking up the difficulties to make work for themselves?""We will make the very best of it,"" Mr Bourns says.""We are absolutely determined this should be regarded as an opportunity for us - we have no other choice."""

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Now it's our job as politicians to get on with it.""He said he was not criticising the judges, but the people who brought the case: ""This is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable.""But for Labour, Lisa Nandy told the programme: ""Britain is leaving the EU and whether or not Parliament has to vote to trigger Article 50, this will happen because, in reality, there are no more than a handful of parliamentarians who would seek to block that decision.""In the landmark ruling, the High Court judges said the government could not trigger the Article 50 process of formally leaving the European Union alone - they must have the approval of Parliament. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the ruling as a ""massive obstacle"" for Mrs May, who says she wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. If the government loses in the Supreme Court, it will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on. MPs could then push to set the terms for negotiating withdrawal and it could face further delays in the Lords.The prime minister's spokeswoman has played down suggestions that Mrs May may call an early general election if she cannot get Parliamentary support, saying that Mrs May believed ""there shouldn't be an election until 2020 and that remains her view"".Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC the result of the EU referendum ""must be respected"".""Parliament voted by six to one to give the decision to the people, no ifs or buts, and that's why we are appealing this to get on with delivering the best deal for Britain."" But Gina Miller, the lead claimant in bringing the case to the High Court, urged the government to ""do the responsible sober thing, which is to do the job we pay them for, to debate all the aspects to do with leaving and then have a vote"".By Eleanor Garnier, BBC political correspondent It is one of the most important constitutional court cases in generations.  And the result creates a nightmare scenario for the government.  Theresa May had said she wanted to start Brexit talks before the end of March next year but this ruling has thrown the prime minister's timetable up in the air.  Campaigners who brought the case insist it was about ""process not politics"", but behind the doors of No 10 there will now be serious head-scratching about what the government's next steps should be. This decision has huge implications, not just on the timing of Brexit but on the terms of Brexit. That's because it's given the initiative to those on the Remain side in the House of Commons who, it's now likely, will argue Article 50 can only be triggered when Parliament is ready and that could mean when they're happy with the terms of any future deal.  Of course, it will be immensely difficult to satisfy and get agreement from all those MPs who voted to remain. Could an early general election be on the cards after all? She rejected criticism that the case was subverting democracy and said it was ""not about politics, this was about process"".""One of the big arguments [in the referendum[ was parliamentary sovereignty... so you can't on the day you get back sovereignty decide you're going to sidestep or throw it away.""The government had argued it could use ancient prerogative powers to give effect ""to the will of the people"".But the three judges looking at the case found there was no constitutional convention of the royal prerogative - powers used by ministers - being used in legislation relating to the EU.They added that triggering Article 50 would fundamentally change UK people's rights - and that the government cannot change or do away with rights under UK law unless Parliament gives it authority to do so. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he feared a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who had backed leaving the EU in June's referendum.""We are heading for a half-Brexit,"" he said.""I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand... I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This ruling underlines the need for the government to bring its negotiating terms to Parliament without delay. Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to Parliament on the terms of Brexit.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told the BBC: ""What the government was seeking to do was to impose a deal that absolutely nobody voted for, that most people who voted to leave wouldn't be happy with and most people who voted to remain wouldn't be happy with, without any kind of Parliamentary scrutiny. ""So it's a terrible shame it had to go to the courts, but what has happened is that democracy and sovereignty have been restored.""The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The EU's other 27 member states have said negotiations about the terms of the UK's exit - due to last two years - cannot begin until Article 50 has been invoked.What questions do you have about the Article 50 High Court ruling?"

The High Court chucked out the government's argument that they had the power to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs.That's a serious problem for Theresa May, who wanted to be able to start the legal machinations of Article 50 without the hassle and political risk of going through Parliament.MPs have already shown they are willing to be difficult over Brexit, or flex every muscle of scrutiny (depending which way you look at it). And with a tiny majority in Parliament and most MPs having argued Remain, this judgement spells real trouble for ministers.An emboldened Parliament is the last thing Mrs May needs when faced with the enormous complexities of taking us out of the EU. But sovereignty is what the country voted for in the referendum. The High Court says that Parliament's sovereignty is what we've got.The legal process will now grind on. The government is appealing at the Supreme Court. But the machinations could well delay the government's plans and, with a braver Parliament able to make life more difficult, might the temptation of an early election become too much to resist?The only way of making this headache go away could be a general election."

The ruling means the UK government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own.It is appealing to the Supreme Court, with a further hearing due next month.The case, which was heard by three judges, is widely regarded as being one of the most important constitutional rulings in generations.The Scottish government had instructed legal representatives to observe the proceedings, but was not directly involved. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the House of Commons the government was ""disappointed"" but remained ""determined to respect the result"" of the EU referendum.Speaking at first minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the ruling would not have come as a huge surprise to anyone who had been following the case. She added: ""We will be looking at the judgement very carefully, and yes we will actively consider whether or not there is a case for the Scottish government to become participants in that case.""The first minister also said the ruling was ""hugely significant and underlines the total chaos and confusion at the heart of the UK government"".She claimed the UK government had attempted to avoid a vote by MPs because ""they don't have a coherent position and they know that if they take their case to the House of Commons that will be exposed.""Ms Sturgeon also reiterated that she was determined to protect Scotland's place in Europe and in the single market ""as far as I possibly can"".She added: ""SNP MPs in the House of Commons will certainly not vote for anything that undermines the will or the interests of the Scottish people.""Responding to the ruling, Scottish Labour Europe spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: ""This ruling shows that the Tories can't get away with ""Brexit means Brexit"" any more. ""Theresa May must put her negotiating objectives in front of parliament as soon as possible, and respect both the judgement of the court and the vital role of parliament in a democratic country.""BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said, if the court's decision was not overturned, there could be delays with potentially ""months and months"" of parliamentary hurdles.But there was not yet ""clarity"" - if the judgement was not overturned - on whether there would be a ""short, sharp"" vote or whether parliament would have to consider complex legislation, he added.He predicted that, although a majority of MPs had backed the Remain campaign, most would ultimately be likely to vote for Article 50, as Brexit had been supported in the referendum.UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said he fears a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who backed leaving the EU in June's referendum and voiced concern at the prospect of a ""half Brexit""."

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing due in December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its end of March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go ahead for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit.Theresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the Eu. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should seek to end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament,"" he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-02,'Mistake' to fight Brexit court ruling,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-37858844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkChallenging a High Court ruling that MPs should be consulted over leaving the EU would be a mistake, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.Judges said the UK government could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without Parliamentary approval.  UK ministers are to appeal, pointing to the referendum result and existing ministerial powers.Pro-Brexit Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called the judges' decision an ""unnecessary distraction"".But Mr Jones said the ruling was ""extremely clear"" that ""the UK Government cannot trigger Article 50 using the Crown prerogative"". ""Indeed, this is consistent with many of the arguments made by the Leave campaign themselves about Parliamentary sovereignty. ""It is a mistake, in my view, to challenge such a clear ruling and we should now try and move ahead to develop a fuller understanding of the UK Government's position. ""The position of the Welsh Government has been consistent throughout - we accept the decision made by the people and will not work against the referendum result - we are working hard to get the best possible exit terms for Wales. ""However, it is important that votes take place in all four nations to endorse the UK negotiating position.""Plaid Cymru's Brexit spokesman, MP Jonathan Edwards, welcomed the High Court ruling and called for the Welsh Assembly and other UK parliaments to have a say on the terms of Brexit as well as the timing.""The people of Wales voted to leave the European Union and we must respect that decision, but nobody has voted for a 'hard Brexit',"" he said. ""Being dragged out of the single market and the customs union as well as the European Union will devastate the Welsh economy and we will continue to resist any attempts to do so.""However, Mr Davies said: ""A clear majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union in June, and Parliament's job is to enact that decision - not to subvert it. ""The people have spoken and their decision must be respected.  ""Parliament had its say when the referendum was approved by an Act of Parliament. There is no basis for a further vote in Parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.""Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.""This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours."""
2016-11-02,NI parties split on potential Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-37857141,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNorthern Ireland's political parties remain sharply divided over Brexit ahead of a possible Westminster vote.The largest party, the DUP, described a High Court ruling that said Parliament must vote before the UK government can trigger Article 50 to leave the EU as ""disappointing"".But, DUP leader Arlene Foster said Brexit would still happen.Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said he has ""no faith"" that MPs will respect Northern Ireland's referendum result.Overall, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU, but in Northern Ireland, a majority of people (56%), voted to stay.Thursday's High Court ruling was a defeat for the Westminster government, but it will now appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.The SDLP's Mark Durkan said his party's three MPs would ""unapologetically defend the will of the 56% of people who voted to remain in the European Union"".The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which has two seats in the House of Commons,  said its MPs would vote in support of the UK-wide result. With eight seats, the DUP is the joint-fourth largest party in the Commons and is strongly in favour of leaving the EU.""On 23 June, the British people as a whole gave a clear mandate for the UK government to leave the EU,"" DUP MP Nigel Dodds said. ""There must be no attempt to block Brexit by people who refuse to accept the will of the people of the UK.""His party leader Arlene Foster has said the ruling will not stop Brexit from happening.She said it was ""clear"" that the UK government was going in a direction that represented the views of the majority of people who voted for the UK to leave the EU.Sinn Féin has four MPs but the party does not take its seats in the House of Commons under a long-held policy of abstentionism.At a Stormont press conference, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was asked if his party would change its policy if there was a ""crucial vote"" on Brexit.He replied that he had already seen a statement from the Labour Party which said it intended to respect the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum result.Labour has 231 seats in the House of Commons, meaning it would be unlikely that Sinn Féin's four MPs could have much influence on the vote.However, Mr McGuinness said any decision to leave the EU would affect the whole island of Ireland.""Brexit will have a massive impact on every one of Ireland's 32 counties,"" he said. ""So we believe that any decisions that need to be taken about the future of this island [should] be taken between our administration in the north and the government in Dublin.""He added: ""As far as I'm concerned, the assembly and the Dáil [Irish parliament] are the people who make the decisions about the future of the people who live in this island.""However, Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister} Enda Kenny said the decision of the High Court in London was a matter for the British government. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Irish government needed to find alternatives to Brexit, and called on all interested parties to work to ensure Northern Ireland is given special status.""The European Union can be quite flexible about making those types of arrangements, and the Irish government needs to be pursuing that position,"" added Mr Adams.Sinn Féin's nationalist rivals, the SDLP, do take their seats at Westminster and the party welcomed the High Court ruling. Mr Durkan said: ""I have consistently called on the government not to begin the formal process of triggering Article 50 on withdrawal from the EU until its proposals have been fully considered in the House of Commons and voted upon by MPs.""He claimed it was now ""incumbent on other MPs from Northern Ireland to commit to representing the democratically stated will of people here"".The UUP's statement said: ""Parliament voted to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to vote in a straight in/out referendum.""On the 23rd June the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and on that basis, should the appeal be unsuccessful, our MPs will vote to trigger Article 50.""The Alliance party does not have any MPs but its Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry also welcomed the ruling.""This at least now provides an opportunity for Parliamentary and Assembly scrutiny of the issues around Brexit,"" he said.  Mr Farry added that the UK government needs ""to spell out much more clearly what they intend Brexit to mean""."
2016-11-02,Prisons to undergo 'major overhaul',https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37854358,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAn extra 2,100 prison officers are to be recruited to ease staffing shortages in jails in England and Wales, Justice Secretary Liz Truss will say later.  Unveiling a White Paper, Ms Truss will say the new recruits should help to reduce attacks on staff and prisoners.She will detail plans for more autonomy for governors and ensure drug tests for inmates when they enter and leave jail.But Labour said the speech would be a ""blatant PR stunt"" unless comprehensive plans to address staff cuts were made.Since 2010, prison officer numbers have fallen from about 25,000 to 18,000.At the same time, the number of prisoners has risen slightly.  The extra officers, costing £100m a year, will not restore staffing to the levels seen before 2010. How dangerous are our prisons?The debate around escalating levels of violence, suicide and self-harm in prisons has increasingly focused on staff shortages.  Union leaders warned on Wednesday that prisons were facing bloodbaths unless more staff were recruited and retained.Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers Association, said proper staffing levels were needed if officers - not inmates - were to be in charge of jails.Warnings also came from prisoners on the inside, with one inmate at London's Pentonville telling the BBC that knives are flown in by drones and razors are melted into toothbrushes to make weapons.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said Ms Truss needed to ""regain the trust of prison governors and prison officers"" with her speech.""The reduction by 25% of frontline prison officers mean those that remain are overstretched, overwhelmed and without support,"" he said.""Without a comprehensive plan to deal with these issues then her speech will be nothing more than empty words and a blatant PR stunt.""The latest figures show a new high of 65 assaults in jails every day.In the year to June, assaults on staff jumped by 43% to 5,954, with 697 of these recorded as serious.Other measures expected to be laid out in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper include:Last month, Ms Truss announced an extra 400 prison officers would be recruited, which means there will be 2,500 new recruits joining the service altogether.BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was a significant increase though it would still leave staff numbers below the 2010 level. In echoes of her predecessor Michael Gove's reform plans, Ms Truss is also planning to give governors more say over how their prisons are run and make sure they are held to account for levels of reoffending and drug misuse. If jails are assessed to be failing, the justice secretary will have a new legal duty to intervene."
2016-11-02,Philip Green pension offer £100m short,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37854657,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkSir Philip Green is offering £100m less than the Pension Regulator is seeking to plug a gap in the BHS pension scheme. The BBC understands that the regulator wants £350m in redress from Sir Philip, who is offering £250m.The regulator launched enforcement action against Sir Philip and other former owners of BHS after failing to agree a deal over pensions.Sir Philip says he had presented ""a credible and substantial proposal"".The regulator is looking for redress for BHS's 20,000 pension scheme members following an investigation into the matter.It has sent warning notices to Sir Philip, his retail group, and Dominic Chappell, who was the owner when the department store chain collapsed.The 300-page notices could see the billionaire being ordered to pay more towards the pension shortfall, which had swollen to nearly £600m by the time BHS went out of business.""I have read the statement from the Pensions Regulator this evening and noted its contents,"" Sir Philip said.His new proposal had evidence of ""cash availability"", could take the scheme out of the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund (PPF), and ""achieve a better outcome for the BHS pensioners"", he said.""I have also spoken to the chairman of the [BHS pension] trustees who is supportive of the proposal on the basis that it provides members with better benefits than they would receive from the PPF,"" Sir Philip added.MPs last month backed a call to strip Sir Philip of his knighthood for his role in the collapse of BHS, which closed just over a year after he sold it for £1 to Mr Chappell, a former racing car driver. The decision on his knighthood would have to be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee.During months of talks Sir Philip has declined to publicly put a number on the level of financial support he would be willing to give the pension schemes.Four and a half months after Sir Philip Green said he'd ""sort"" the BHS pension deficit, the regulator has seemingly lost patience. It has warned Sir Philip and brief owner Dominic Chappell it thinks there is a strong case for them to be forced to help plug the £600m hole in the scheme. Sir Philip hit back saying he had tabled a substantial proposal that would provide a better result for the 20,000 members than the reduced benefits offered by the pensions lifeboat scheme and one that had the backing of the chairman of the BHS pension trustees. The regulator said the door remained open for an improved offer but failing that, an independent panel would decide whether the evidence against Sir Philip and others is strong enough to force them to pay up and determine how much. That panel will meet sometime next year. Any decision can be appealed against and even if Sir Philip is eventually forced to pay, it is likely any money will go to soften the hit to the Pension Protection Fund rather than directly to the BHS pensioners.Read Simon's blog in fullLesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: ""Our decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.""  Frank Field, who co-chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS, said: ""We are not surprised that the Pensions Regulator has, like all the rest of us, lost patience with Sir Philip Green's excuses and empty promises.""Iain Wright, the other chairman of the inquiry, said that five months after Sir Philip told MPs he would ""sort out the pensions mess"" he has put ""no credible plan or cash on the table"". ""We have seen stalling for time, lack of real progress in the negotiations and that's why the regulator has to do what it has done - understandable, regrettable, but I can perfectly understand what's been going on,"" he told the BBC.Mr Wright also pointed out that while BHS stores have been closing, staff have been losing their jobs and worrying about their pensions ""he takes ownership of his third yacht and spends his summer in the Med. That level of inequality really rankles with people"".The Pensions Regulator opened an investigation into the BHS pension situation in March 2015.It said it has now launched enforcement action after reviewing almost 100,000 documents and holding talks with various BHS stakeholders.Sir Philip and the other recipients of the notices will have an opportunity to reply.It could then be sent to an independent determinations panel, which can impose a financial order that the regulator and former owners must then agree.Independent pensions expert John Ralfe said it was likely to be a very long process that could end up being dragged through the highest courts.A separate case has been stuck at stage one - the enforcement notice - for three years, he told the BBC."

After loud laughter from the audience, he clarified his comments, saying Brexit would be a ""colossal success"". The annual ceremony from the magazine awarded Mr Johnson the political comeback of the year prize.Accepting it, he said: ""In the words of our great prime minister... I understood that Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a Titanic success of it.""Landale: Can PM stop mocking Boris?But it was not just Mr Johnson getting the laughs. Prime Minister Theresa May paid sartorial tribute to former chancellor George Osborne, appearing alongside him wearing a hard hat and high-visibility jacket as she accepted her politician of the year prize.The apparel was much favoured by Mr Osborne during his cabinet days for official visits to factories and large-scale infrastructure projects.As she accepted her award, the prime minister told the audience: ""Oh, come on. We're all builders now.""Mr Osborne was the guest of honour, using his speech to mock himself and his party colleagues as he handed out his own ""real parliamentary awards"". His self-styled ""Sam Allardyce campaign manager of the year award"" went to Michael Gove -  who Mr Osborne said ""made up with the quantity of his leadership campaigns what they lacked in quality"".He gave his ""President Erdogan prize for the attempted coup that makes the leader stronger"" to the entire parliamentary Labour Party, referring to the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader in September. Mr Osborne later presented Mrs May with her politician of the year award. Accepting it, Mrs May added a dig over Mr Osborne's warnings on behalf of the Remain campaign ahead of the Brexit referendum.She said: ""I'm particularly pleased to receive this award from George, because I gather that when it came to the voting it actually got very tight and I owe it to George that he just nudged me over the line - because he told the other members of the jury that if they didn't vote for me, the economy would collapse and World War Three would start.""Mrs May also joked about Sir Craig Oliver, former director of communications for her predecessor, David Cameron.She said: ""I understand that in his book about the referendum campaign, Craig says that, when he heard the result of the referendum, he walked out of the office, he walked out into Whitehall and he started retching violently.""I have to say, I think we all know that feeling. Most of us experienced it too - when we saw his name on the resignation honours list.""But she changed the tone by raising a toast to Mr Cameron, who recently stood down as an MP."

I'd say so,"" Cavendish wrote in his four-star review.""Given the current, high levels of concern about immigration and how long a shadow that speech has cast, [this was] a depressingly necessary evening.""The production is partly set in 1992 and sees Caribbean immigrant Rose Cruickshank confront the MP about his views.The play also flashes back to 1960s to see the influences that shaped the two main characters.Ann Treneman of The Times also gave the show four stars, adding that McDiarmid ""gives a standout performance"".""This play does not mince words,"" she wrote. ""Some are offensive, yet [writer] Chris Hannan isn't interested in political correctness but in getting to the core of a story.""Not just about Powell but of England - what does it mean to be English and who exactly are we anyway?""The Financial Times described the play as ""compelling"" in its four-star review, while The Stage said the production was ""timely and intelligent"".Michael Billington gave the production a slightly less warm review in The Guardian, awarding it three stars.""While Hannan makes it clear that we are still obsessed with immigration and the nature of Englishness, his play is much better at exploring the paradoxes of Powell than those of the surrounding culture,"" he wrote.Referring to the two main characters, he added: ""Powell, whatever you think of him, is complex. His principal antagonist, Rose, is simply confusing.""WhatsOnStage also gave the show three stars. ""Hannan brings history back to life: a black and white photo recoloured. It sheds light on the present,"" wrote Matt Trueman.""Hannan's structure sets up eloquent and forceful head-to-heads, but in giving space to vital debates, each strand gives up its narrative drive.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "

She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

According to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the ""black-widow spider"".Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.""Her charity, the True and Fair Foundation, formerly known as Miller Philanthropy, was launched in 2009.The foundation says it supports smaller charities by providing funding and support. Charity Commission records show it spent £135,982 in 2015.Ms Miller launched the Brexit legal case along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the caseMs Miller has argued that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.But she has stressed throughout that the challenge is not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now.""Speaking after the High Court announced its verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"".  She said: ""What we're saying is, very simply, you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about getting back a sovereign Parliament and being in control but at the same time then bypass it.""Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.""This case is far more fundamental than that. ""It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament. ""We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship."""
2016-11-02,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37860618,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe claim: The High Court ruling that the government cannot use prerogative powers to trigger Article 50 could scupper Brexit.Reality check verdict: The process of obtaining parliamentary approval may delay or complicate the process but it is hard to imagine that Parliament could ignore the outcome of the referendum.The High Court has ruled that the government does not have the power to trigger Article 50 - to start formal exit negotiations with the EU - without the approval of Parliament.The ruling was made by two of the UK's most senior judges, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls and another experienced colleague, Lord Justice Sales. The government is appealing to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case in early December.Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who sits on the Committee on exiting the European Union, told BBC News: ""A lot of people... will be shocked to see a very small group of people go to court and effectively seek the form of redress, which could end up scuppering a referendum.""He later went on to say that he did not think the ruling would stop Brexit happening.The government currently plans to trigger Article 50 in March 2017 and this timetable may be threatened.If the Supreme Court rules in late December or January that the approval of Parliament is needed then it would be more difficult for that to happen in time for March.But prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC News: ""I don't think this affects the timetable at all."" However, he did warn that it opened the possibility of Parliament voting against Article 50 being triggered, causing a constitutional crisis. The High Court did not specify what form the approval of Parliament has to take but there is broad consensus that it would have to be an Act of Parliament. Passing that legislation could be complicated and time-consuming because it would require there to be debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, allowing there to be amendments tabled that could, for example, limit the government's freedom in negotiations about the UK's future relationship with the EU.It is possible that this could delay the triggering of Article 50 beyond March, but could it scupper Brexit altogether?If all the MPs voted in the way that they campaigned in the referendum then there would be a Commons majority for staying in the EU, but it is enormously unlikely that they would decide to ignore the outcome of the referendum.Labour's shadow secretary for exiting the European Union, Keir Starmer, was very clear in telling BBC News: ""We accept and respect the outcome of the referendum.""But he added that the court ruling should force the government to set out the outline principles on which it would be negotiating."
2016-11-02,James Landale,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37863003,"Theresa May is going to have to start taking Boris Johnson seriously if she wants the world to do likewise. Last night I sat on the same table as the foreign secretary at the Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. He was given a gong for ""comeback of the year"" after his failed leadership bid propelled him into King Charles Street. Mr Johnson gave a typically self-deprecatory speech, saying he hoped he would last longer than Lord Heseltine's mother's dog, Kim, which survived partial strangulation by the Tory peer only later to be put down. He spoke about the need to press on with Brexit, which he described as taking ""the machete of freedom to the brambles of EU legislation"". He told a funny story about how he had recently caused confusion at a dinner with EU colleagues in Bratislava: he said Brexit Britain would support the EU from the outside, like a flying buttress; the interpreters translated this as a ""flying bucket"".And of course, there was the inevitable verbal slip when he promised that Brexit would be a ""titantic success"", a classicist's reference to the mythological giants rather than the ill-fated ship.Then the prime minister got to her feet. I shall pass over her venomous assault on Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former communications chief, except to note that several senior Tories were stunned by her lack of grace. One - almost speechless - said it was the most unprimeministerial thing they had ever heard. But it was what Mrs May said about Boris Johnson that struck me most. Picking up on his reference to Lady Heseltine's aggressive Alsatian, the prime minister looked directly at her foreign secretary - I was directly in the eye line - and said: ""Boris, the dog was put down... (pause)...  when its master decided it wasn't needed any more.""It was a funny line. And we laughed. But it also struck me what a barbed line it was too. It was a warning as much as a joke, a threat of political euthanasia for a colleague if he stepped out of line.I also noted that this was, yet another, occasion when the prime minister had chosen to mock her foreign secretary in public. At the start of her conference speech last month, before the serried ranks of Tory faithful, Mrs May said there were many questions hanging in the air, including: ""Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days?... (pause)... just about.""Now every government has a court jester and Boris Johnson will never be able to escape that title. But his role in this government is crucial. He is there to convince the international community that Britain is not turning its back on the world post Brexit, that Britain has a positive role to play in global affairs.And to do that he needs to be taken seriously. Many foreign politicians and diplomats that I speak to tell me they are pleasantly surprised when they meet the foreign secretary for the first time. They talk of the man behind the caricature - the cultured, over-educated intellectual who often speaks a bit of their language and who can be thoughtful when he is not gripped by banter. The problem is that many others - who have not met the foreign secretary in person - often still see him as a kind of upmarket Nigel Farage, a Eurosceptic clown with clout. So to do his job, Britain's diplomat-in-chief needs of every bit of credibility he can lay his hands on. He is already the butt of many jokes. The last thing he needs is his prime minister adding to the mirth."
2016-11-02,Not irreversible,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Scottish cross-bench peer who wrote Article 50 - the procedure by which the UK would leave the EU - believed it was ""not irrevocable"". In a BBC interview, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard said the UK could choose to stay in the EU even after exit negotiations had begun. He has also renewed calls for either parliament or the public to be given a chance to stop Brexit. The UK government insisted the leave vote must be respected. His comments come as the High Court is to rule on whether the government can begin the formal process of leaving the European Union without consulting Parliament.Prime Minister Theresa May said she would trigger the two year exit negotiation process by the end of March 2017. This procedure, which is described in Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, should ensure the UK leaves the EU in 2019. But Lord Kerr, who devised the clause, said the country ""might want to think again"" when Brexit terms become clearer. He explained: ""It is not irrevocable.""You can change your mind while the process is going on. ""During that period, if a country were to decide actually we don't want to leave after all, everybody would be very cross about it being a waste of time. ""They might try to extract a political price but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.""Lord Kerr wants either parliament or the public - through an election or a second referendum - to revisit the decision to leave the EU in a year to 18 months time. Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out reversing the result of the EU referendum vote which took place on 23 June and resulted in 52% of UK voters backing the campaign to leave. Lord Kerr is advising First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon on Brexit as she seeks to maintain Scotland's links with the EU. He does not think it would be possible for Scotland to remain in the EU single market if the UK as a whole is leaving. However, he said different arrangements for access to the single market for different parts of the UK could be possible. Lord Kerr said: ""It is possible to envisage the Scots being in an ante room to the council [of EU ministers] in Brussels, rather closer to the action than the English might be on particular subjects.""The former diplomat also said that he does not believe a vote for independence would secure Scotland unbroken membership of the EU. ""I think that when independent the Scots could apply and probably get in pretty quickly through the door marked accession. But they can't stay inside,"" he said. When Lord Kerr argued a similar case during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign, the Scottish government insisted that the EU would find a way of accommodating Scotland.  Although the UK as a whole chose to leave the EU in the referendum ballot, voters in Scotland decided by 62% to 38% to stay.Lord Kerr is a former head of the British diplomatic service and served as both UK ambassador to the EU and the United States. After leaving the foreign office, he was secretary-general of the European convention, which drafted what became the Lisbon treaty. It included Article 50 which sets out the process by which any member state can leave the EU. Lord Kerr said the process ""wasn't really necessary"" because it has always been possible for a country to quit. He added: ""If you stopped paying the bills and you stopped turning up at the meetings, in due course your friends would notice that you seemed to have left.""Lord Kerr said he had never imagined the UK would make use of Article 50. He explained: ""I thought the circumstances in which it would be used, if ever, would be when there was a coup in a member state and the EU suspended that country's membership. ""I thought that at that point the dictator in question might be so cross that he'd say 'right, I'm off' and it would be good to have a procedure under which he could leave."" A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""The UK voted to leave the European Union. The people have spoken and it is now the duty of the government to make sure that happens.""Government lawyers also made clear in legal proceedings before the High Court that, as a matter of firm policy, notification of withdrawal will not be withdrawn."""

In the longer term, in the event that the standing of the City of London were to be diminished, there is concern as to how much will be available in this jurisdiction, where people should be locating, where they should be qualifying and so on.""The society is also warning that uncertainty at the outcome of the 23 June referendum could mean the position of England and Wales as the ""global legal centre"" comes under threat from rivals including New York and Singapore.Mr Bourns said global businesses choose the legal system of England and Wales to resolve disputes but this status could be undermined as the UK plots its post-Brexit course.""Competing jurisdictions are saying English and Welsh law is not as useful as it used to be and perhaps you'd like to use a different jurisdiction,"" he told the BBC.The legal industry employs 370,000 people across England and Wales with a turnover of £26bn - and ""anything that goes towards undermining that would be a problem"", he says.The society also fears multi-national law firms will be damaged by the loss of an EU directive allowing solicitors to work in other member states, saying this could mean complicated negotiations with authorities in each country they operate in.Bad news for England and Wales could be good news for Ireland, where the Law Society is reporting a surge in the numbers of solicitors and barristers applying to practice.MPs are beginning an inquiry into the implications of Brexit  on the justice system, including a focus on the European Arrest Warrant, which the Law Society says must be retained.Once Article 50 negotiations are complete, and the UK leaves, lawyers are likely to be kept busy by the government's Great Repeal Bill, with which it plans to incorporate all EU regulations into UK law, before picking and choosing the ones it wants to keep.""It's absolutely vast,"" said Mr Bourns.""We've been members of the EU for 43 years. There are about 350 directives that are presently in the course of implementation. So what happens to those?""He predicted a ""role for the courts"" in settling disputes about whether EU or UK rules applied in different situations, and questioned what would happen when EU legislation is amended by Brussels after it has been incorporated into UK law.As for what the UK decides to keep, he said the challenge would be to ""ensure we don't inadvertently miss something that means we're disadvantaged"".""Lawyers are very much involved, there's no doubt about that.""Clients are asking, and clients are planning. So there's a lot of work to be done.""But aren't lawyers just talking up the difficulties to make work for themselves?""We will make the very best of it,"" Mr Bourns says.""We are absolutely determined this should be regarded as an opportunity for us - we have no other choice."""

But turnout in areas with a higher proportion of younger residents tended to be lower. As well as age, educational attainment and national identity were also key factors in how the UK voted.The overall resultLeave polled the most strongly in 270 counting areas, with Remain coming first in 129.

2016-11-02,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Now it's our job as politicians to get on with it.""He said he was not criticising the judges, but the people who brought the case: ""This is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable.""But for Labour, Lisa Nandy told the programme: ""Britain is leaving the EU and whether or not Parliament has to vote to trigger Article 50, this will happen because, in reality, there are no more than a handful of parliamentarians who would seek to block that decision.""In the landmark ruling, the High Court judges said the government could not trigger the Article 50 process of formally leaving the European Union alone - they must have the approval of Parliament. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the ruling as a ""massive obstacle"" for Mrs May, who says she wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. If the government loses in the Supreme Court, it will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on. MPs could then push to set the terms for negotiating withdrawal and it could face further delays in the Lords.The prime minister's spokeswoman has played down suggestions that Mrs May may call an early general election if she cannot get Parliamentary support, saying that Mrs May believed ""there shouldn't be an election until 2020 and that remains her view"".Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC the result of the EU referendum ""must be respected"".""Parliament voted by six to one to give the decision to the people, no ifs or buts, and that's why we are appealing this to get on with delivering the best deal for Britain."" But Gina Miller, the lead claimant in bringing the case to the High Court, urged the government to ""do the responsible sober thing, which is to do the job we pay them for, to debate all the aspects to do with leaving and then have a vote"".By Eleanor Garnier, BBC political correspondent It is one of the most important constitutional court cases in generations.  And the result creates a nightmare scenario for the government.  Theresa May had said she wanted to start Brexit talks before the end of March next year but this ruling has thrown the prime minister's timetable up in the air.  Campaigners who brought the case insist it was about ""process not politics"", but behind the doors of No 10 there will now be serious head-scratching about what the government's next steps should be. This decision has huge implications, not just on the timing of Brexit but on the terms of Brexit. That's because it's given the initiative to those on the Remain side in the House of Commons who, it's now likely, will argue Article 50 can only be triggered when Parliament is ready and that could mean when they're happy with the terms of any future deal.  Of course, it will be immensely difficult to satisfy and get agreement from all those MPs who voted to remain. Could an early general election be on the cards after all? She rejected criticism that the case was subverting democracy and said it was ""not about politics, this was about process"".""One of the big arguments [in the referendum[ was parliamentary sovereignty... so you can't on the day you get back sovereignty decide you're going to sidestep or throw it away.""The government had argued it could use ancient prerogative powers to give effect ""to the will of the people"".But the three judges looking at the case found there was no constitutional convention of the royal prerogative - powers used by ministers - being used in legislation relating to the EU.They added that triggering Article 50 would fundamentally change UK people's rights - and that the government cannot change or do away with rights under UK law unless Parliament gives it authority to do so. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he feared a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who had backed leaving the EU in June's referendum.""We are heading for a half-Brexit,"" he said.""I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand... I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This ruling underlines the need for the government to bring its negotiating terms to Parliament without delay. Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to Parliament on the terms of Brexit.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told the BBC: ""What the government was seeking to do was to impose a deal that absolutely nobody voted for, that most people who voted to leave wouldn't be happy with and most people who voted to remain wouldn't be happy with, without any kind of Parliamentary scrutiny. ""So it's a terrible shame it had to go to the courts, but what has happened is that democracy and sovereignty have been restored.""The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The EU's other 27 member states have said negotiations about the terms of the UK's exit - due to last two years - cannot begin until Article 50 has been invoked.What questions do you have about the Article 50 High Court ruling?"

The High Court chucked out the government's argument that they had the power to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs.That's a serious problem for Theresa May, who wanted to be able to start the legal machinations of Article 50 without the hassle and political risk of going through Parliament.MPs have already shown they are willing to be difficult over Brexit, or flex every muscle of scrutiny (depending which way you look at it). And with a tiny majority in Parliament and most MPs having argued Remain, this judgement spells real trouble for ministers.An emboldened Parliament is the last thing Mrs May needs when faced with the enormous complexities of taking us out of the EU. But sovereignty is what the country voted for in the referendum. The High Court says that Parliament's sovereignty is what we've got.The legal process will now grind on. The government is appealing at the Supreme Court. But the machinations could well delay the government's plans and, with a braver Parliament able to make life more difficult, might the temptation of an early election become too much to resist?The only way of making this headache go away could be a general election."

The ruling means the UK government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own.It is appealing to the Supreme Court, with a further hearing due next month.The case, which was heard by three judges, is widely regarded as being one of the most important constitutional rulings in generations.The Scottish government had instructed legal representatives to observe the proceedings, but was not directly involved. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the House of Commons the government was ""disappointed"" but remained ""determined to respect the result"" of the EU referendum.Speaking at first minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the ruling would not have come as a huge surprise to anyone who had been following the case. She added: ""We will be looking at the judgement very carefully, and yes we will actively consider whether or not there is a case for the Scottish government to become participants in that case.""The first minister also said the ruling was ""hugely significant and underlines the total chaos and confusion at the heart of the UK government"".She claimed the UK government had attempted to avoid a vote by MPs because ""they don't have a coherent position and they know that if they take their case to the House of Commons that will be exposed.""Ms Sturgeon also reiterated that she was determined to protect Scotland's place in Europe and in the single market ""as far as I possibly can"".She added: ""SNP MPs in the House of Commons will certainly not vote for anything that undermines the will or the interests of the Scottish people.""Responding to the ruling, Scottish Labour Europe spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: ""This ruling shows that the Tories can't get away with ""Brexit means Brexit"" any more.

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing due in December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its end of March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go ahead for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit.Theresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the Eu. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should seek to end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament,"" he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

UK ministers are to appeal, pointing to the referendum result and existing ministerial powers.Pro-Brexit Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called the judges' decision an ""unnecessary distraction"".But Mr Jones said the ruling was ""extremely clear"" that ""the UK Government cannot trigger Article 50 using the Crown prerogative"". ""Indeed, this is consistent with many of the arguments made by the Leave campaign themselves about Parliamentary sovereignty. ""It is a mistake, in my view, to challenge such a clear ruling and we should now try and move ahead to develop a fuller understanding of the UK Government's position. ""The position of the Welsh Government has been consistent throughout - we accept the decision made by the people and will not work against the referendum result - we are working hard to get the best possible exit terms for Wales. ""However, it is important that votes take place in all four nations to endorse the UK negotiating position.""Plaid Cymru's Brexit spokesman, MP Jonathan Edwards, welcomed the High Court ruling and called for the Welsh Assembly and other UK parliaments to have a say on the terms of Brexit as well as the timing.""The people of Wales voted to leave the European Union and we must respect that decision, but nobody has voted for a 'hard Brexit',"" he said. ""Being dragged out of the single market and the customs union as well as the European Union will devastate the Welsh economy and we will continue to resist any attempts to do so.""However, Mr Davies said: ""A clear majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union in June, and Parliament's job is to enact that decision - not to subvert it. ""The people have spoken and their decision must be respected.  ""Parliament had its say when the referendum was approved by an Act of Parliament. There is no basis for a further vote in Parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.""Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.""This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours."""
2016-11-03,NI parties split on potential Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-37857141,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNorthern Ireland's political parties remain sharply divided over Brexit ahead of a possible Westminster vote.The largest party, the DUP, described a High Court ruling that said Parliament must vote before the UK government can trigger Article 50 to leave the EU as ""disappointing"".But, DUP leader Arlene Foster said Brexit would still happen.Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said he has ""no faith"" that MPs will respect Northern Ireland's referendum result.Overall, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU, but in Northern Ireland, a majority of people (56%), voted to stay.Thursday's High Court ruling was a defeat for the Westminster government, but it will now appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.The SDLP's Mark Durkan said his party's three MPs would ""unapologetically defend the will of the 56% of people who voted to remain in the European Union"".The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which has two seats in the House of Commons,  said its MPs would vote in support of the UK-wide result. With eight seats, the DUP is the joint-fourth largest party in the Commons and is strongly in favour of leaving the EU.""On 23 June, the British people as a whole gave a clear mandate for the UK government to leave the EU,"" DUP MP Nigel Dodds said. ""There must be no attempt to block Brexit by people who refuse to accept the will of the people of the UK.""His party leader Arlene Foster has said the ruling will not stop Brexit from happening.She said it was ""clear"" that the UK government was going in a direction that represented the views of the majority of people who voted for the UK to leave the EU.Sinn Féin has four MPs but the party does not take its seats in the House of Commons under a long-held policy of abstentionism.At a Stormont press conference, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was asked if his party would change its policy if there was a ""crucial vote"" on Brexit.He replied that he had already seen a statement from the Labour Party which said it intended to respect the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum result.Labour has 231 seats in the House of Commons, meaning it would be unlikely that Sinn Féin's four MPs could have much influence on the vote.However, Mr McGuinness said any decision to leave the EU would affect the whole island of Ireland.""Brexit will have a massive impact on every one of Ireland's 32 counties,"" he said. ""So we believe that any decisions that need to be taken about the future of this island [should] be taken between our administration in the north and the government in Dublin.""He added: ""As far as I'm concerned, the assembly and the Dáil [Irish parliament] are the people who make the decisions about the future of the people who live in this island.""However, Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister} Enda Kenny said the decision of the High Court in London was a matter for the British government. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Irish government needed to find alternatives to Brexit, and called on all interested parties to work to ensure Northern Ireland is given special status.""The European Union can be quite flexible about making those types of arrangements, and the Irish government needs to be pursuing that position,"" added Mr Adams.Sinn Féin's nationalist rivals, the SDLP, do take their seats at Westminster and the party welcomed the High Court ruling. Mr Durkan said: ""I have consistently called on the government not to begin the formal process of triggering Article 50 on withdrawal from the EU until its proposals have been fully considered in the House of Commons and voted upon by MPs.""He claimed it was now ""incumbent on other MPs from Northern Ireland to commit to representing the democratically stated will of people here"".The UUP's statement said: ""Parliament voted to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to vote in a straight in/out referendum.""On the 23rd June the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and on that basis, should the appeal be unsuccessful, our MPs will vote to trigger Article 50.""The Alliance party does not have any MPs but its Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry also welcomed the ruling.""This at least now provides an opportunity for Parliamentary and Assembly scrutiny of the issues around Brexit,"" he said.  Mr Farry added that the UK government needs ""to spell out much more clearly what they intend Brexit to mean""."
2016-11-03,Prisons to undergo 'major overhaul',https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37854358,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAn extra 2,100 prison officers are to be recruited to ease staffing shortages in jails in England and Wales, Justice Secretary Liz Truss will say later.  Unveiling a White Paper, Ms Truss will say the new recruits should help to reduce attacks on staff and prisoners.She will detail plans for more autonomy for governors and ensure drug tests for inmates when they enter and leave jail.But Labour said the speech would be a ""blatant PR stunt"" unless comprehensive plans to address staff cuts were made.Since 2010, prison officer numbers have fallen from about 25,000 to 18,000.At the same time, the number of prisoners has risen slightly.  The extra officers, costing £100m a year, will not restore staffing to the levels seen before 2010. How dangerous are our prisons?The debate around escalating levels of violence, suicide and self-harm in prisons has increasingly focused on staff shortages.  Union leaders warned on Wednesday that prisons were facing bloodbaths unless more staff were recruited and retained.Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers Association, said proper staffing levels were needed if officers - not inmates - were to be in charge of jails.Warnings also came from prisoners on the inside, with one inmate at London's Pentonville telling the BBC that knives are flown in by drones and razors are melted into toothbrushes to make weapons.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said Ms Truss needed to ""regain the trust of prison governors and prison officers"" with her speech.""The reduction by 25% of frontline prison officers mean those that remain are overstretched, overwhelmed and without support,"" he said.""Without a comprehensive plan to deal with these issues then her speech will be nothing more than empty words and a blatant PR stunt.""The latest figures show a new high of 65 assaults in jails every day.In the year to June, assaults on staff jumped by 43% to 5,954, with 697 of these recorded as serious.Other measures expected to be laid out in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper include:Last month, Ms Truss announced an extra 400 prison officers would be recruited, which means there will be 2,500 new recruits joining the service altogether.BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was a significant increase though it would still leave staff numbers below the 2010 level. In echoes of her predecessor Michael Gove's reform plans, Ms Truss is also planning to give governors more say over how their prisons are run and make sure they are held to account for levels of reoffending and drug misuse. If jails are assessed to be failing, the justice secretary will have a new legal duty to intervene."
2016-11-03,Philip Green pension offer £100m short,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37854657,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkSir Philip Green is offering £100m less than the Pension Regulator is seeking to plug a gap in the BHS pension scheme. The BBC understands that the regulator wants £350m in redress from Sir Philip, who is offering £250m.The regulator launched enforcement action against Sir Philip and other former owners of BHS after failing to agree a deal over pensions.Sir Philip says he had presented ""a credible and substantial proposal"".The regulator is looking for redress for BHS's 20,000 pension scheme members following an investigation into the matter.It has sent warning notices to Sir Philip, his retail group, and Dominic Chappell, who was the owner when the department store chain collapsed.The 300-page notices could see the billionaire being ordered to pay more towards the pension shortfall, which had swollen to nearly £600m by the time BHS went out of business.""I have read the statement from the Pensions Regulator this evening and noted its contents,"" Sir Philip said.His new proposal had evidence of ""cash availability"", could take the scheme out of the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund (PPF), and ""achieve a better outcome for the BHS pensioners"", he said.""I have also spoken to the chairman of the [BHS pension] trustees who is supportive of the proposal on the basis that it provides members with better benefits than they would receive from the PPF,"" Sir Philip added.MPs last month backed a call to strip Sir Philip of his knighthood for his role in the collapse of BHS, which closed just over a year after he sold it for £1 to Mr Chappell, a former racing car driver. The decision on his knighthood would have to be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee.During months of talks Sir Philip has declined to publicly put a number on the level of financial support he would be willing to give the pension schemes.Four and a half months after Sir Philip Green said he'd ""sort"" the BHS pension deficit, the regulator has seemingly lost patience. It has warned Sir Philip and brief owner Dominic Chappell it thinks there is a strong case for them to be forced to help plug the £600m hole in the scheme. Sir Philip hit back saying he had tabled a substantial proposal that would provide a better result for the 20,000 members than the reduced benefits offered by the pensions lifeboat scheme and one that had the backing of the chairman of the BHS pension trustees. The regulator said the door remained open for an improved offer but failing that, an independent panel would decide whether the evidence against Sir Philip and others is strong enough to force them to pay up and determine how much. That panel will meet sometime next year. Any decision can be appealed against and even if Sir Philip is eventually forced to pay, it is likely any money will go to soften the hit to the Pension Protection Fund rather than directly to the BHS pensioners.Read Simon's blog in fullLesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: ""Our decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.""  Frank Field, who co-chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS, said: ""We are not surprised that the Pensions Regulator has, like all the rest of us, lost patience with Sir Philip Green's excuses and empty promises.""Iain Wright, the other chairman of the inquiry, said that five months after Sir Philip told MPs he would ""sort out the pensions mess"" he has put ""no credible plan or cash on the table"". ""We have seen stalling for time, lack of real progress in the negotiations and that's why the regulator has to do what it has done - understandable, regrettable, but I can perfectly understand what's been going on,"" he told the BBC.Mr Wright also pointed out that while BHS stores have been closing, staff have been losing their jobs and worrying about their pensions ""he takes ownership of his third yacht and spends his summer in the Med. That level of inequality really rankles with people"".The Pensions Regulator opened an investigation into the BHS pension situation in March 2015.It said it has now launched enforcement action after reviewing almost 100,000 documents and holding talks with various BHS stakeholders.Sir Philip and the other recipients of the notices will have an opportunity to reply.It could then be sent to an independent determinations panel, which can impose a financial order that the regulator and former owners must then agree.Independent pensions expert John Ralfe said it was likely to be a very long process that could end up being dragged through the highest courts.A separate case has been stuck at stage one - the enforcement notice - for three years, he told the BBC."
2016-11-03,Johnson makes 'Titanic' Brexit comment,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37858143,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has said the UK will make a ""Titanic success"" of Brexit.He made the remark as he was presenting an award to George Osborne at the Spectator magazine's Parliamentarian of the Year ceremony in London. After loud laughter from the audience, he clarified his comments, saying Brexit would be a ""colossal success"". The annual ceremony from the magazine awarded Mr Johnson the political comeback of the year prize.Accepting it, he said: ""In the words of our great prime minister... I understood that Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a Titanic success of it.""Landale: Can PM stop mocking Boris?But it was not just Mr Johnson getting the laughs. Prime Minister Theresa May paid sartorial tribute to former chancellor George Osborne, appearing alongside him wearing a hard hat and high-visibility jacket as she accepted her politician of the year prize.The apparel was much favoured by Mr Osborne during his cabinet days for official visits to factories and large-scale infrastructure projects.As she accepted her award, the prime minister told the audience: ""Oh, come on. We're all builders now.""Mr Osborne was the guest of honour, using his speech to mock himself and his party colleagues as he handed out his own ""real parliamentary awards"". His self-styled ""Sam Allardyce campaign manager of the year award"" went to Michael Gove -  who Mr Osborne said ""made up with the quantity of his leadership campaigns what they lacked in quality"".He gave his ""President Erdogan prize for the attempted coup that makes the leader stronger"" to the entire parliamentary Labour Party, referring to the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader in September. Mr Osborne later presented Mrs May with her politician of the year award. Accepting it, Mrs May added a dig over Mr Osborne's warnings on behalf of the Remain campaign ahead of the Brexit referendum.She said: ""I'm particularly pleased to receive this award from George, because I gather that when it came to the voting it actually got very tight and I owe it to George that he just nudged me over the line - because he told the other members of the jury that if they didn't vote for me, the economy would collapse and World War Three would start.""Mrs May also joked about Sir Craig Oliver, former director of communications for her predecessor, David Cameron.She said: ""I understand that in his book about the referendum campaign, Craig says that, when he heard the result of the referendum, he walked out of the office, he walked out into Whitehall and he started retching violently.""I have to say, I think we all know that feeling. Most of us experienced it too - when we saw his name on the resignation honours list.""But she changed the tone by raising a toast to Mr Cameron, who recently stood down as an MP."
2016-11-03,'Provocative' Enoch Powell play praised,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37858681,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA new play about MP Enoch Powell has been described as ""the most provocative theatre act in a decade"" by one critic.Ian McDiarmid plays the late politician in What Shadows, which examines his infamous anti-immigration Rivers of Blood speech from 1968.The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that it was ""chilling"" to hear his sentiments again ""as if newly minted"".The Birmingham Repertory Theatre should be ""applauded for opening the floodgates to serious debate"", he said.""Does this re-enactment... rank as the most provocative theatrical act of the decade? I'd say so,"" Cavendish wrote in his four-star review.""Given the current, high levels of concern about immigration and how long a shadow that speech has cast, [this was] a depressingly necessary evening.""The production is partly set in 1992 and sees Caribbean immigrant Rose Cruickshank confront the MP about his views.The play also flashes back to 1960s to see the influences that shaped the two main characters.Ann Treneman of The Times also gave the show four stars, adding that McDiarmid ""gives a standout performance"".""This play does not mince words,"" she wrote. ""Some are offensive, yet [writer] Chris Hannan isn't interested in political correctness but in getting to the core of a story.""Not just about Powell but of England - what does it mean to be English and who exactly are we anyway?""The Financial Times described the play as ""compelling"" in its four-star review, while The Stage said the production was ""timely and intelligent"".Michael Billington gave the production a slightly less warm review in The Guardian, awarding it three stars.""While Hannan makes it clear that we are still obsessed with immigration and the nature of Englishness, his play is much better at exploring the paradoxes of Powell than those of the surrounding culture,"" he wrote.Referring to the two main characters, he added: ""Powell, whatever you think of him, is complex. His principal antagonist, Rose, is simply confusing.""WhatsOnStage also gave the show three stars. ""Hannan brings history back to life: a black and white photo recoloured. It sheds light on the present,"" wrote Matt Trueman.""Hannan's structure sets up eloquent and forceful head-to-heads, but in giving space to vital debates, each strand gives up its narrative drive.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

The people, who were also sovereign, then delivered the biggest ever electoral mandate, to leave the EU."

2016-11-03,UKIP leadership: Runners and riders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37567690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUKIP is holding a fresh leadership contest after the recently-elected Diane James unexpectedly quit after 18 days in the post. Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-03,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014.

He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend.

Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches.

According to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the ""black-widow spider"".Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.""Her charity, the True and Fair Foundation, formerly known as Miller Philanthropy, was launched in 2009.The foundation says it supports smaller charities by providing funding and support. Charity Commission records show it spent £135,982 in 2015.Ms Miller launched the Brexit legal case along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the caseMs Miller has argued that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.But she has stressed throughout that the challenge is not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now.""Speaking after the High Court announced its verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"".  She said: ""What we're saying is, very simply, you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about getting back a sovereign Parliament and being in control but at the same time then bypass it.""Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.""This case is far more fundamental than that. ""It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament. ""We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship."""

The government is appealing to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case in early December.Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who sits on the Committee on exiting the European Union, told BBC News: ""A lot of people... will be shocked to see a very small group of people go to court and effectively seek the form of redress, which could end up scuppering a referendum.""He later went on to say that he did not think the ruling would stop Brexit happening.The government currently plans to trigger Article 50 in March 2017 and this timetable may be threatened.If the Supreme Court rules in late December or January that the approval of Parliament is needed then it would be more difficult for that to happen in time for March.But prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC News: ""I don't think this affects the timetable at all."" However, he did warn that it opened the possibility of Parliament voting against Article 50 being triggered, causing a constitutional crisis. The High Court did not specify what form the approval of Parliament has to take but there is broad consensus that it would have to be an Act of Parliament. Passing that legislation could be complicated and time-consuming because it would require there to be debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, allowing there to be amendments tabled that could, for example, limit the government's freedom in negotiations about the UK's future relationship with the EU.It is possible that this could delay the triggering of Article 50 beyond March, but could it scupper Brexit altogether?If all the MPs voted in the way that they campaigned in the referendum then there would be a Commons majority for staying in the EU, but it is enormously unlikely that they would decide to ignore the outcome of the referendum.Labour's shadow secretary for exiting the European Union, Keir Starmer, was very clear in telling BBC News: ""We accept and respect the outcome of the referendum.""But he added that the court ruling should force the government to set out the outline principles on which it would be negotiating."
2016-11-03,James Landale,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37863003,"Theresa May is going to have to start taking Boris Johnson seriously if she wants the world to do likewise. Last night I sat on the same table as the foreign secretary at the Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. He was given a gong for ""comeback of the year"" after his failed leadership bid propelled him into King Charles Street. Mr Johnson gave a typically self-deprecatory speech, saying he hoped he would last longer than Lord Heseltine's mother's dog, Kim, which survived partial strangulation by the Tory peer only later to be put down. He spoke about the need to press on with Brexit, which he described as taking ""the machete of freedom to the brambles of EU legislation"". He told a funny story about how he had recently caused confusion at a dinner with EU colleagues in Bratislava: he said Brexit Britain would support the EU from the outside, like a flying buttress; the interpreters translated this as a ""flying bucket"".And of course, there was the inevitable verbal slip when he promised that Brexit would be a ""titantic success"", a classicist's reference to the mythological giants rather than the ill-fated ship.Then the prime minister got to her feet. I shall pass over her venomous assault on Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former communications chief, except to note that several senior Tories were stunned by her lack of grace. One - almost speechless - said it was the most unprimeministerial thing they had ever heard. But it was what Mrs May said about Boris Johnson that struck me most. Picking up on his reference to Lady Heseltine's aggressive Alsatian, the prime minister looked directly at her foreign secretary - I was directly in the eye line - and said: ""Boris, the dog was put down... (pause)...  when its master decided it wasn't needed any more.""It was a funny line. And we laughed. But it also struck me what a barbed line it was too. It was a warning as much as a joke, a threat of political euthanasia for a colleague if he stepped out of line.I also noted that this was, yet another, occasion when the prime minister had chosen to mock her foreign secretary in public. At the start of her conference speech last month, before the serried ranks of Tory faithful, Mrs May said there were many questions hanging in the air, including: ""Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days?... (pause)... just about.""Now every government has a court jester and Boris Johnson will never be able to escape that title. But his role in this government is crucial. He is there to convince the international community that Britain is not turning its back on the world post Brexit, that Britain has a positive role to play in global affairs.And to do that he needs to be taken seriously. Many foreign politicians and diplomats that I speak to tell me they are pleasantly surprised when they meet the foreign secretary for the first time. They talk of the man behind the caricature - the cultured, over-educated intellectual who often speaks a bit of their language and who can be thoughtful when he is not gripped by banter. The problem is that many others - who have not met the foreign secretary in person - often still see him as a kind of upmarket Nigel Farage, a Eurosceptic clown with clout. So to do his job, Britain's diplomat-in-chief needs of every bit of credibility he can lay his hands on. He is already the butt of many jokes. The last thing he needs is his prime minister adding to the mirth."
2016-11-03,Not irreversible,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Scottish cross-bench peer who wrote Article 50 - the procedure by which the UK would leave the EU - believed it was ""not irrevocable"". In a BBC interview, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard said the UK could choose to stay in the EU even after exit negotiations had begun. He has also renewed calls for either parliament or the public to be given a chance to stop Brexit. The UK government insisted the leave vote must be respected. His comments come as the High Court is to rule on whether the government can begin the formal process of leaving the European Union without consulting Parliament.Prime Minister Theresa May said she would trigger the two year exit negotiation process by the end of March 2017. This procedure, which is described in Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, should ensure the UK leaves the EU in 2019. But Lord Kerr, who devised the clause, said the country ""might want to think again"" when Brexit terms become clearer. He explained: ""It is not irrevocable.""You can change your mind while the process is going on. ""During that period, if a country were to decide actually we don't want to leave after all, everybody would be very cross about it being a waste of time. ""They might try to extract a political price but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.""Lord Kerr wants either parliament or the public - through an election or a second referendum - to revisit the decision to leave the EU in a year to 18 months time. Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out reversing the result of the EU referendum vote which took place on 23 June and resulted in 52% of UK voters backing the campaign to leave. Lord Kerr is advising First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon on Brexit as she seeks to maintain Scotland's links with the EU. He does not think it would be possible for Scotland to remain in the EU single market if the UK as a whole is leaving. However, he said different arrangements for access to the single market for different parts of the UK could be possible. Lord Kerr said: ""It is possible to envisage the Scots being in an ante room to the council [of EU ministers] in Brussels, rather closer to the action than the English might be on particular subjects.""The former diplomat also said that he does not believe a vote for independence would secure Scotland unbroken membership of the EU. ""I think that when independent the Scots could apply and probably get in pretty quickly through the door marked accession. But they can't stay inside,"" he said. When Lord Kerr argued a similar case during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign, the Scottish government insisted that the EU would find a way of accommodating Scotland.  Although the UK as a whole chose to leave the EU in the referendum ballot, voters in Scotland decided by 62% to 38% to stay.Lord Kerr is a former head of the British diplomatic service and served as both UK ambassador to the EU and the United States. After leaving the foreign office, he was secretary-general of the European convention, which drafted what became the Lisbon treaty. It included Article 50 which sets out the process by which any member state can leave the EU. Lord Kerr said the process ""wasn't really necessary"" because it has always been possible for a country to quit. He added: ""If you stopped paying the bills and you stopped turning up at the meetings, in due course your friends would notice that you seemed to have left.""Lord Kerr said he had never imagined the UK would make use of Article 50. He explained: ""I thought the circumstances in which it would be used, if ever, would be when there was a coup in a member state and the EU suspended that country's membership. ""I thought that at that point the dictator in question might be so cross that he'd say 'right, I'm off' and it would be good to have a procedure under which he could leave."" A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""The UK voted to leave the European Union. The people have spoken and it is now the duty of the government to make sure that happens.""Government lawyers also made clear in legal proceedings before the High Court that, as a matter of firm policy, notification of withdrawal will not be withdrawn."""

In the longer term, in the event that the standing of the City of London were to be diminished, there is concern as to how much will be available in this jurisdiction, where people should be locating, where they should be qualifying and so on.""The society is also warning that uncertainty at the outcome of the 23 June referendum could mean the position of England and Wales as the ""global legal centre"" comes under threat from rivals including New York and Singapore.Mr Bourns said global businesses choose the legal system of England and Wales to resolve disputes but this status could be undermined as the UK plots its post-Brexit course.""Competing jurisdictions are saying English and Welsh law is not as useful as it used to be and perhaps you'd like to use a different jurisdiction,"" he told the BBC.The legal industry employs 370,000 people across England and Wales with a turnover of £26bn - and ""anything that goes towards undermining that would be a problem"", he says.The society also fears multi-national law firms will be damaged by the loss of an EU directive allowing solicitors to work in other member states, saying this could mean complicated negotiations with authorities in each country they operate in.Bad news for England and Wales could be good news for Ireland, where the Law Society is reporting a surge in the numbers of solicitors and barristers applying to practice.MPs are beginning an inquiry into the implications of Brexit  on the justice system, including a focus on the European Arrest Warrant, which the Law Society says must be retained.Once Article 50 negotiations are complete, and the UK leaves, lawyers are likely to be kept busy by the government's Great Repeal Bill, with which it plans to incorporate all EU regulations into UK law, before picking and choosing the ones it wants to keep.""It's absolutely vast,"" said Mr Bourns.""We've been members of the EU for 43 years. There are about 350 directives that are presently in the course of implementation. So what happens to those?""He predicted a ""role for the courts"" in settling disputes about whether EU or UK rules applied in different situations, and questioned what would happen when EU legislation is amended by Brussels after it has been incorporated into UK law.As for what the UK decides to keep, he said the challenge would be to ""ensure we don't inadvertently miss something that means we're disadvantaged"".""Lawyers are very much involved, there's no doubt about that.""Clients are asking, and clients are planning. So there's a lot of work to be done.""But aren't lawyers just talking up the difficulties to make work for themselves?""We will make the very best of it,"" Mr Bourns says.""We are absolutely determined this should be regarded as an opportunity for us - we have no other choice."""

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-04,Brexit case 'bid to block voters' will',https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37866411,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA High Court case that could delay the Brexit process is ""a clear attempt to frustrate the will of the British people"", says a cabinet minister.Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC One's Question Time the referendum result had been ""very, very clear"" and politicians should ""get on with that"".But three judges ruled that the PM could not trigger the formal Brexit process without Parliament's backing.The Supreme Court is expected to hear the government's appeal next month.Prime Minister Theresa May is due to speak to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker by phone on Friday to say she intends to stick to her March 2017 deadline for triggering Article 50.Addressing Thursday's ruling on Question Time, Mr Javid said the vast majority of MPs had backed legislation to bring forward a referendum on the UK's EU membership in 2015 and the public had clearly voted in favour of leaving the EU.He said there was a ""moral issue"" at stake: ""It was a clear result, clear instructions were issued... by the British people to their politicians saying: We need a decision. Now it's our job as politicians to get on with it.""He said he was not criticising the judges, but the people who brought the case: ""This is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable.""But for Labour, Lisa Nandy told the programme: ""Britain is leaving the EU and whether or not Parliament has to vote to trigger Article 50, this will happen because, in reality, there are no more than a handful of parliamentarians who would seek to block that decision.""In the landmark ruling, the High Court judges said the government could not trigger the Article 50 process of formally leaving the European Union alone - they must have the approval of Parliament. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the ruling as a ""massive obstacle"" for Mrs May, who says she wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. If the government loses in the Supreme Court, it will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on. MPs could then push to set the terms for negotiating withdrawal and it could face further delays in the Lords.The prime minister's spokeswoman has played down suggestions that Mrs May may call an early general election if she cannot get Parliamentary support, saying that Mrs May believed ""there shouldn't be an election until 2020 and that remains her view"".Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC the result of the EU referendum ""must be respected"".""Parliament voted by six to one to give the decision to the people, no ifs or buts, and that's why we are appealing this to get on with delivering the best deal for Britain."" But Gina Miller, the lead claimant in bringing the case to the High Court, urged the government to ""do the responsible sober thing, which is to do the job we pay them for, to debate all the aspects to do with leaving and then have a vote"".By Eleanor Garnier, BBC political correspondent It is one of the most important constitutional court cases in generations.  And the result creates a nightmare scenario for the government.  Theresa May had said she wanted to start Brexit talks before the end of March next year but this ruling has thrown the prime minister's timetable up in the air.  Campaigners who brought the case insist it was about ""process not politics"", but behind the doors of No 10 there will now be serious head-scratching about what the government's next steps should be. This decision has huge implications, not just on the timing of Brexit but on the terms of Brexit. That's because it's given the initiative to those on the Remain side in the House of Commons who, it's now likely, will argue Article 50 can only be triggered when Parliament is ready and that could mean when they're happy with the terms of any future deal.  Of course, it will be immensely difficult to satisfy and get agreement from all those MPs who voted to remain. Could an early general election be on the cards after all? She rejected criticism that the case was subverting democracy and said it was ""not about politics, this was about process"".""One of the big arguments [in the referendum[ was parliamentary sovereignty... so you can't on the day you get back sovereignty decide you're going to sidestep or throw it away.""The government had argued it could use ancient prerogative powers to give effect ""to the will of the people"".But the three judges looking at the case found there was no constitutional convention of the royal prerogative - powers used by ministers - being used in legislation relating to the EU.They added that triggering Article 50 would fundamentally change UK people's rights - and that the government cannot change or do away with rights under UK law unless Parliament gives it authority to do so. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he feared a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who had backed leaving the EU in June's referendum.""We are heading for a half-Brexit,"" he said.""I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand... I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This ruling underlines the need for the government to bring its negotiating terms to Parliament without delay. Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to Parliament on the terms of Brexit.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told the BBC: ""What the government was seeking to do was to impose a deal that absolutely nobody voted for, that most people who voted to leave wouldn't be happy with and most people who voted to remain wouldn't be happy with, without any kind of Parliamentary scrutiny. ""So it's a terrible shame it had to go to the courts, but what has happened is that democracy and sovereignty have been restored.""The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The EU's other 27 member states have said negotiations about the terms of the UK's exit - due to last two years - cannot begin until Article 50 has been invoked.What questions do you have about the Article 50 High Court ruling?"
2016-11-04,Will Brexit struggles mean early election?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37861456,"The three bewigged government lawyers looked glum as the clock ticked towards 10 in Court Four in the Royal Courts of Justice.They had good reason to. The High Court chucked out the government's argument that they had the power to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs.That's a serious problem for Theresa May, who wanted to be able to start the legal machinations of Article 50 without the hassle and political risk of going through Parliament.MPs have already shown they are willing to be difficult over Brexit, or flex every muscle of scrutiny (depending which way you look at it). And with a tiny majority in Parliament and most MPs having argued Remain, this judgement spells real trouble for ministers.An emboldened Parliament is the last thing Mrs May needs when faced with the enormous complexities of taking us out of the EU. But sovereignty is what the country voted for in the referendum. The High Court says that Parliament's sovereignty is what we've got.The legal process will now grind on. The government is appealing at the Supreme Court. But the machinations could well delay the government's plans and, with a braver Parliament able to make life more difficult, might the temptation of an early election become too much to resist?The only way of making this headache go away could be a general election."

The ruling means the UK government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own.It is appealing to the Supreme Court, with a further hearing due next month.The case, which was heard by three judges, is widely regarded as being one of the most important constitutional rulings in generations.The Scottish government had instructed legal representatives to observe the proceedings, but was not directly involved. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the House of Commons the government was ""disappointed"" but remained ""determined to respect the result"" of the EU referendum.Speaking at first minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the ruling would not have come as a huge surprise to anyone who had been following the case. She added: ""We will be looking at the judgement very carefully, and yes we will actively consider whether or not there is a case for the Scottish government to become participants in that case.""The first minister also said the ruling was ""hugely significant and underlines the total chaos and confusion at the heart of the UK government"".She claimed the UK government had attempted to avoid a vote by MPs because ""they don't have a coherent position and they know that if they take their case to the House of Commons that will be exposed.""Ms Sturgeon also reiterated that she was determined to protect Scotland's place in Europe and in the single market ""as far as I possibly can"".She added: ""SNP MPs in the House of Commons will certainly not vote for anything that undermines the will or the interests of the Scottish people.""Responding to the ruling, Scottish Labour Europe spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: ""This ruling shows that the Tories can't get away with ""Brexit means Brexit"" any more. ""Theresa May must put her negotiating objectives in front of parliament as soon as possible, and respect both the judgement of the court and the vital role of parliament in a democratic country.""BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said, if the court's decision was not overturned, there could be delays with potentially ""months and months"" of parliamentary hurdles.But there was not yet ""clarity"" - if the judgement was not overturned - on whether there would be a ""short, sharp"" vote or whether parliament would have to consider complex legislation, he added.He predicted that, although a majority of MPs had backed the Remain campaign, most would ultimately be likely to vote for Article 50, as Brexit had been supported in the referendum.UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said he fears a ""betrayal"" of the 51.9% of voters who backed leaving the EU in June's referendum and voiced concern at the prospect of a ""half Brexit""."

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing due in December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its end of March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go ahead for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit.Theresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the Eu. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should seek to end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament,"" he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-04,'Mistake' to fight Brexit court ruling,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-37858844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkChallenging a High Court ruling that MPs should be consulted over leaving the EU would be a mistake, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.Judges said the UK government could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without Parliamentary approval.  UK ministers are to appeal, pointing to the referendum result and existing ministerial powers.Pro-Brexit Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called the judges' decision an ""unnecessary distraction"".But Mr Jones said the ruling was ""extremely clear"" that ""the UK Government cannot trigger Article 50 using the Crown prerogative"". ""Indeed, this is consistent with many of the arguments made by the Leave campaign themselves about Parliamentary sovereignty. ""It is a mistake, in my view, to challenge such a clear ruling and we should now try and move ahead to develop a fuller understanding of the UK Government's position. ""The position of the Welsh Government has been consistent throughout - we accept the decision made by the people and will not work against the referendum result - we are working hard to get the best possible exit terms for Wales. ""However, it is important that votes take place in all four nations to endorse the UK negotiating position.""Plaid Cymru's Brexit spokesman, MP Jonathan Edwards, welcomed the High Court ruling and called for the Welsh Assembly and other UK parliaments to have a say on the terms of Brexit as well as the timing.""The people of Wales voted to leave the European Union and we must respect that decision, but nobody has voted for a 'hard Brexit',"" he said. ""Being dragged out of the single market and the customs union as well as the European Union will devastate the Welsh economy and we will continue to resist any attempts to do so.""However, Mr Davies said: ""A clear majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union in June, and Parliament's job is to enact that decision - not to subvert it. ""The people have spoken and their decision must be respected.  ""Parliament had its say when the referendum was approved by an Act of Parliament. There is no basis for a further vote in Parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.""Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.""This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours."""
2016-11-04,NI parties split on potential Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-37857141,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNorthern Ireland's political parties remain sharply divided over Brexit ahead of a possible Westminster vote.The largest party, the DUP, described a High Court ruling that said Parliament must vote before the UK government can trigger Article 50 to leave the EU as ""disappointing"".But, DUP leader Arlene Foster said Brexit would still happen.Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said he has ""no faith"" that MPs will respect Northern Ireland's referendum result.Overall, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU, but in Northern Ireland, a majority of people (56%), voted to stay.Thursday's High Court ruling was a defeat for the Westminster government, but it will now appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.The SDLP's Mark Durkan said his party's three MPs would ""unapologetically defend the will of the 56% of people who voted to remain in the European Union"".The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which has two seats in the House of Commons,  said its MPs would vote in support of the UK-wide result. With eight seats, the DUP is the joint-fourth largest party in the Commons and is strongly in favour of leaving the EU.""On 23 June, the British people as a whole gave a clear mandate for the UK government to leave the EU,"" DUP MP Nigel Dodds said. ""There must be no attempt to block Brexit by people who refuse to accept the will of the people of the UK.""His party leader Arlene Foster has said the ruling will not stop Brexit from happening.She said it was ""clear"" that the UK government was going in a direction that represented the views of the majority of people who voted for the UK to leave the EU.Sinn Féin has four MPs but the party does not take its seats in the House of Commons under a long-held policy of abstentionism.At a Stormont press conference, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was asked if his party would change its policy if there was a ""crucial vote"" on Brexit.He replied that he had already seen a statement from the Labour Party which said it intended to respect the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum result.Labour has 231 seats in the House of Commons, meaning it would be unlikely that Sinn Féin's four MPs could have much influence on the vote.However, Mr McGuinness said any decision to leave the EU would affect the whole island of Ireland.""Brexit will have a massive impact on every one of Ireland's 32 counties,"" he said. ""So we believe that any decisions that need to be taken about the future of this island [should] be taken between our administration in the north and the government in Dublin.""He added: ""As far as I'm concerned, the assembly and the Dáil [Irish parliament] are the people who make the decisions about the future of the people who live in this island.""However, Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister} Enda Kenny said the decision of the High Court in London was a matter for the British government. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Irish government needed to find alternatives to Brexit, and called on all interested parties to work to ensure Northern Ireland is given special status.""The European Union can be quite flexible about making those types of arrangements, and the Irish government needs to be pursuing that position,"" added Mr Adams.Sinn Féin's nationalist rivals, the SDLP, do take their seats at Westminster and the party welcomed the High Court ruling. Mr Durkan said: ""I have consistently called on the government not to begin the formal process of triggering Article 50 on withdrawal from the EU until its proposals have been fully considered in the House of Commons and voted upon by MPs.""He claimed it was now ""incumbent on other MPs from Northern Ireland to commit to representing the democratically stated will of people here"".The UUP's statement said: ""Parliament voted to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to vote in a straight in/out referendum.""On the 23rd June the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and on that basis, should the appeal be unsuccessful, our MPs will vote to trigger Article 50.""The Alliance party does not have any MPs but its Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry also welcomed the ruling.""This at least now provides an opportunity for Parliamentary and Assembly scrutiny of the issues around Brexit,"" he said.  Mr Farry added that the UK government needs ""to spell out much more clearly what they intend Brexit to mean""."
2016-11-04,Prisons to undergo 'major overhaul',https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37854358,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAn extra 2,100 prison officers are to be recruited to ease staffing shortages in jails in England and Wales, Justice Secretary Liz Truss will say later.  Unveiling a White Paper, Ms Truss will say the new recruits should help to reduce attacks on staff and prisoners.She will detail plans for more autonomy for governors and ensure drug tests for inmates when they enter and leave jail.But Labour said the speech would be a ""blatant PR stunt"" unless comprehensive plans to address staff cuts were made.Since 2010, prison officer numbers have fallen from about 25,000 to 18,000.At the same time, the number of prisoners has risen slightly.  The extra officers, costing £100m a year, will not restore staffing to the levels seen before 2010. How dangerous are our prisons?The debate around escalating levels of violence, suicide and self-harm in prisons has increasingly focused on staff shortages.  Union leaders warned on Wednesday that prisons were facing bloodbaths unless more staff were recruited and retained.Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers Association, said proper staffing levels were needed if officers - not inmates - were to be in charge of jails.Warnings also came from prisoners on the inside, with one inmate at London's Pentonville telling the BBC that knives are flown in by drones and razors are melted into toothbrushes to make weapons.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said Ms Truss needed to ""regain the trust of prison governors and prison officers"" with her speech.""The reduction by 25% of frontline prison officers mean those that remain are overstretched, overwhelmed and without support,"" he said.""Without a comprehensive plan to deal with these issues then her speech will be nothing more than empty words and a blatant PR stunt.""The latest figures show a new high of 65 assaults in jails every day.In the year to June, assaults on staff jumped by 43% to 5,954, with 697 of these recorded as serious.Other measures expected to be laid out in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper include:Last month, Ms Truss announced an extra 400 prison officers would be recruited, which means there will be 2,500 new recruits joining the service altogether.BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was a significant increase though it would still leave staff numbers below the 2010 level. In echoes of her predecessor Michael Gove's reform plans, Ms Truss is also planning to give governors more say over how their prisons are run and make sure they are held to account for levels of reoffending and drug misuse. If jails are assessed to be failing, the justice secretary will have a new legal duty to intervene."
2016-11-04,Philip Green pension offer £100m short,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37854657,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkSir Philip Green is offering £100m less than the Pension Regulator is seeking to plug a gap in the BHS pension scheme. The BBC understands that the regulator wants £350m in redress from Sir Philip, who is offering £250m.The regulator launched enforcement action against Sir Philip and other former owners of BHS after failing to agree a deal over pensions.Sir Philip says he had presented ""a credible and substantial proposal"".The regulator is looking for redress for BHS's 20,000 pension scheme members following an investigation into the matter.It has sent warning notices to Sir Philip, his retail group, and Dominic Chappell, who was the owner when the department store chain collapsed.The 300-page notices could see the billionaire being ordered to pay more towards the pension shortfall, which had swollen to nearly £600m by the time BHS went out of business.""I have read the statement from the Pensions Regulator this evening and noted its contents,"" Sir Philip said.His new proposal had evidence of ""cash availability"", could take the scheme out of the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund (PPF), and ""achieve a better outcome for the BHS pensioners"", he said.""I have also spoken to the chairman of the [BHS pension] trustees who is supportive of the proposal on the basis that it provides members with better benefits than they would receive from the PPF,"" Sir Philip added.MPs last month backed a call to strip Sir Philip of his knighthood for his role in the collapse of BHS, which closed just over a year after he sold it for £1 to Mr Chappell, a former racing car driver. The decision on his knighthood would have to be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee.During months of talks Sir Philip has declined to publicly put a number on the level of financial support he would be willing to give the pension schemes.Four and a half months after Sir Philip Green said he'd ""sort"" the BHS pension deficit, the regulator has seemingly lost patience. It has warned Sir Philip and brief owner Dominic Chappell it thinks there is a strong case for them to be forced to help plug the £600m hole in the scheme. Sir Philip hit back saying he had tabled a substantial proposal that would provide a better result for the 20,000 members than the reduced benefits offered by the pensions lifeboat scheme and one that had the backing of the chairman of the BHS pension trustees. The regulator said the door remained open for an improved offer but failing that, an independent panel would decide whether the evidence against Sir Philip and others is strong enough to force them to pay up and determine how much. That panel will meet sometime next year. Any decision can be appealed against and even if Sir Philip is eventually forced to pay, it is likely any money will go to soften the hit to the Pension Protection Fund rather than directly to the BHS pensioners.Read Simon's blog in fullLesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: ""Our decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.""  Frank Field, who co-chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS, said: ""We are not surprised that the Pensions Regulator has, like all the rest of us, lost patience with Sir Philip Green's excuses and empty promises.""Iain Wright, the other chairman of the inquiry, said that five months after Sir Philip told MPs he would ""sort out the pensions mess"" he has put ""no credible plan or cash on the table"". ""We have seen stalling for time, lack of real progress in the negotiations and that's why the regulator has to do what it has done - understandable, regrettable, but I can perfectly understand what's been going on,"" he told the BBC.Mr Wright also pointed out that while BHS stores have been closing, staff have been losing their jobs and worrying about their pensions ""he takes ownership of his third yacht and spends his summer in the Med. That level of inequality really rankles with people"".The Pensions Regulator opened an investigation into the BHS pension situation in March 2015.It said it has now launched enforcement action after reviewing almost 100,000 documents and holding talks with various BHS stakeholders.Sir Philip and the other recipients of the notices will have an opportunity to reply.It could then be sent to an independent determinations panel, which can impose a financial order that the regulator and former owners must then agree.Independent pensions expert John Ralfe said it was likely to be a very long process that could end up being dragged through the highest courts.A separate case has been stuck at stage one - the enforcement notice - for three years, he told the BBC."

After loud laughter from the audience, he clarified his comments, saying Brexit would be a ""colossal success"". The annual ceremony from the magazine awarded Mr Johnson the political comeback of the year prize.Accepting it, he said: ""In the words of our great prime minister... I understood that Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a Titanic success of it.""Landale: Can PM stop mocking Boris?But it was not just Mr Johnson getting the laughs. Prime Minister Theresa May paid sartorial tribute to former chancellor George Osborne, appearing alongside him wearing a hard hat and high-visibility jacket as she accepted her politician of the year prize.The apparel was much favoured by Mr Osborne during his cabinet days for official visits to factories and large-scale infrastructure projects.As she accepted her award, the prime minister told the audience: ""Oh, come on. We're all builders now.""Mr Osborne was the guest of honour, using his speech to mock himself and his party colleagues as he handed out his own ""real parliamentary awards"". His self-styled ""Sam Allardyce campaign manager of the year award"" went to Michael Gove -  who Mr Osborne said ""made up with the quantity of his leadership campaigns what they lacked in quality"".He gave his ""President Erdogan prize for the attempted coup that makes the leader stronger"" to the entire parliamentary Labour Party, referring to the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader in September. Mr Osborne later presented Mrs May with her politician of the year award. Accepting it, Mrs May added a dig over Mr Osborne's warnings on behalf of the Remain campaign ahead of the Brexit referendum.She said: ""I'm particularly pleased to receive this award from George, because I gather that when it came to the voting it actually got very tight and I owe it to George that he just nudged me over the line - because he told the other members of the jury that if they didn't vote for me, the economy would collapse and World War Three would start.""Mrs May also joked about Sir Craig Oliver, former director of communications for her predecessor, David Cameron.She said: ""I understand that in his book about the referendum campaign, Craig says that, when he heard the result of the referendum, he walked out of the office, he walked out into Whitehall and he started retching violently.""I have to say, I think we all know that feeling. Most of us experienced it too - when we saw his name on the resignation honours list.""But she changed the tone by raising a toast to Mr Cameron, who recently stood down as an MP."

I'd say so,"" Cavendish wrote in his four-star review.""Given the current, high levels of concern about immigration and how long a shadow that speech has cast, [this was] a depressingly necessary evening.""The production is partly set in 1992 and sees Caribbean immigrant Rose Cruickshank confront the MP about his views.The play also flashes back to 1960s to see the influences that shaped the two main characters.Ann Treneman of The Times also gave the show four stars, adding that McDiarmid ""gives a standout performance"".""This play does not mince words,"" she wrote. ""Some are offensive, yet [writer] Chris Hannan isn't interested in political correctness but in getting to the core of a story.""Not just about Powell but of England - what does it mean to be English and who exactly are we anyway?""The Financial Times described the play as ""compelling"" in its four-star review, while The Stage said the production was ""timely and intelligent"".Michael Billington gave the production a slightly less warm review in The Guardian, awarding it three stars.""While Hannan makes it clear that we are still obsessed with immigration and the nature of Englishness, his play is much better at exploring the paradoxes of Powell than those of the surrounding culture,"" he wrote.Referring to the two main characters, he added: ""Powell, whatever you think of him, is complex. His principal antagonist, Rose, is simply confusing.""WhatsOnStage also gave the show three stars. ""Hannan brings history back to life: a black and white photo recoloured. It sheds light on the present,"" wrote Matt Trueman.""Hannan's structure sets up eloquent and forceful head-to-heads, but in giving space to vital debates, each strand gives up its narrative drive.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

2016-11-04,UKIP leadership: Runners and riders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37567690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUKIP is holding a fresh leadership contest after the recently-elected Diane James unexpectedly quit after 18 days in the post. Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-04,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

According to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the ""black-widow spider"".Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.""Her charity, the True and Fair Foundation, formerly known as Miller Philanthropy, was launched in 2009.The foundation says it supports smaller charities by providing funding and support. Charity Commission records show it spent £135,982 in 2015.Ms Miller launched the Brexit legal case along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the caseMs Miller has argued that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.But she has stressed throughout that the challenge is not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now.""Speaking after the High Court announced its verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"".  She said: ""What we're saying is, very simply, you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about getting back a sovereign Parliament and being in control but at the same time then bypass it.""Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.""This case is far more fundamental than that. ""It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament. ""We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship."""
2016-11-04,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37860618,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe claim: The High Court ruling that the government cannot use prerogative powers to trigger Article 50 could scupper Brexit.Reality check verdict: The process of obtaining parliamentary approval may delay or complicate the process but it is hard to imagine that Parliament could ignore the outcome of the referendum.The High Court has ruled that the government does not have the power to trigger Article 50 - to start formal exit negotiations with the EU - without the approval of Parliament.The ruling was made by two of the UK's most senior judges, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls and another experienced colleague, Lord Justice Sales. The government is appealing to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case in early December.Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who sits on the Committee on exiting the European Union, told BBC News: ""A lot of people... will be shocked to see a very small group of people go to court and effectively seek the form of redress, which could end up scuppering a referendum.""He later went on to say that he did not think the ruling would stop Brexit happening.The government currently plans to trigger Article 50 in March 2017 and this timetable may be threatened.If the Supreme Court rules in late December or January that the approval of Parliament is needed then it would be more difficult for that to happen in time for March.But prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC News: ""I don't think this affects the timetable at all."" However, he did warn that it opened the possibility of Parliament voting against Article 50 being triggered, causing a constitutional crisis. The High Court did not specify what form the approval of Parliament has to take but there is broad consensus that it would have to be an Act of Parliament. Passing that legislation could be complicated and time-consuming because it would require there to be debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, allowing there to be amendments tabled that could, for example, limit the government's freedom in negotiations about the UK's future relationship with the EU.It is possible that this could delay the triggering of Article 50 beyond March, but could it scupper Brexit altogether?If all the MPs voted in the way that they campaigned in the referendum then there would be a Commons majority for staying in the EU, but it is enormously unlikely that they would decide to ignore the outcome of the referendum.Labour's shadow secretary for exiting the European Union, Keir Starmer, was very clear in telling BBC News: ""We accept and respect the outcome of the referendum.""But he added that the court ruling should force the government to set out the outline principles on which it would be negotiating."
2016-11-04,James Landale,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37863003,"Theresa May is going to have to start taking Boris Johnson seriously if she wants the world to do likewise. Last night I sat on the same table as the foreign secretary at the Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. He was given a gong for ""comeback of the year"" after his failed leadership bid propelled him into King Charles Street. Mr Johnson gave a typically self-deprecatory speech, saying he hoped he would last longer than Lord Heseltine's mother's dog, Kim, which survived partial strangulation by the Tory peer only later to be put down. He spoke about the need to press on with Brexit, which he described as taking ""the machete of freedom to the brambles of EU legislation"". He told a funny story about how he had recently caused confusion at a dinner with EU colleagues in Bratislava: he said Brexit Britain would support the EU from the outside, like a flying buttress; the interpreters translated this as a ""flying bucket"".And of course, there was the inevitable verbal slip when he promised that Brexit would be a ""titantic success"", a classicist's reference to the mythological giants rather than the ill-fated ship.Then the prime minister got to her feet. I shall pass over her venomous assault on Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former communications chief, except to note that several senior Tories were stunned by her lack of grace. One - almost speechless - said it was the most unprimeministerial thing they had ever heard. But it was what Mrs May said about Boris Johnson that struck me most. Picking up on his reference to Lady Heseltine's aggressive Alsatian, the prime minister looked directly at her foreign secretary - I was directly in the eye line - and said: ""Boris, the dog was put down... (pause)...  when its master decided it wasn't needed any more.""It was a funny line. And we laughed. But it also struck me what a barbed line it was too. It was a warning as much as a joke, a threat of political euthanasia for a colleague if he stepped out of line.I also noted that this was, yet another, occasion when the prime minister had chosen to mock her foreign secretary in public. At the start of her conference speech last month, before the serried ranks of Tory faithful, Mrs May said there were many questions hanging in the air, including: ""Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days?... (pause)... just about.""Now every government has a court jester and Boris Johnson will never be able to escape that title. But his role in this government is crucial. He is there to convince the international community that Britain is not turning its back on the world post Brexit, that Britain has a positive role to play in global affairs.And to do that he needs to be taken seriously. Many foreign politicians and diplomats that I speak to tell me they are pleasantly surprised when they meet the foreign secretary for the first time. They talk of the man behind the caricature - the cultured, over-educated intellectual who often speaks a bit of their language and who can be thoughtful when he is not gripped by banter. The problem is that many others - who have not met the foreign secretary in person - often still see him as a kind of upmarket Nigel Farage, a Eurosceptic clown with clout. So to do his job, Britain's diplomat-in-chief needs of every bit of credibility he can lay his hands on. He is already the butt of many jokes. The last thing he needs is his prime minister adding to the mirth."
2016-11-04,Not irreversible,https://web.archive.org//web/20161104014736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Scottish cross-bench peer who wrote Article 50 - the procedure by which the UK would leave the EU - believed it was ""not irrevocable"". In a BBC interview, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard said the UK could choose to stay in the EU even after exit negotiations had begun. He has also renewed calls for either parliament or the public to be given a chance to stop Brexit. The UK government insisted the leave vote must be respected. His comments come as the High Court is to rule on whether the government can begin the formal process of leaving the European Union without consulting Parliament.Prime Minister Theresa May said she would trigger the two year exit negotiation process by the end of March 2017. This procedure, which is described in Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, should ensure the UK leaves the EU in 2019. But Lord Kerr, who devised the clause, said the country ""might want to think again"" when Brexit terms become clearer. He explained: ""It is not irrevocable.""You can change your mind while the process is going on. ""During that period, if a country were to decide actually we don't want to leave after all, everybody would be very cross about it being a waste of time. ""They might try to extract a political price but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.""Lord Kerr wants either parliament or the public - through an election or a second referendum - to revisit the decision to leave the EU in a year to 18 months time. Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out reversing the result of the EU referendum vote which took place on 23 June and resulted in 52% of UK voters backing the campaign to leave. Lord Kerr is advising First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon on Brexit as she seeks to maintain Scotland's links with the EU. He does not think it would be possible for Scotland to remain in the EU single market if the UK as a whole is leaving. However, he said different arrangements for access to the single market for different parts of the UK could be possible. Lord Kerr said: ""It is possible to envisage the Scots being in an ante room to the council [of EU ministers] in Brussels, rather closer to the action than the English might be on particular subjects.""The former diplomat also said that he does not believe a vote for independence would secure Scotland unbroken membership of the EU. ""I think that when independent the Scots could apply and probably get in pretty quickly through the door marked accession. But they can't stay inside,"" he said. When Lord Kerr argued a similar case during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign, the Scottish government insisted that the EU would find a way of accommodating Scotland.  Although the UK as a whole chose to leave the EU in the referendum ballot, voters in Scotland decided by 62% to 38% to stay.Lord Kerr is a former head of the British diplomatic service and served as both UK ambassador to the EU and the United States. After leaving the foreign office, he was secretary-general of the European convention, which drafted what became the Lisbon treaty. It included Article 50 which sets out the process by which any member state can leave the EU. Lord Kerr said the process ""wasn't really necessary"" because it has always been possible for a country to quit. He added: ""If you stopped paying the bills and you stopped turning up at the meetings, in due course your friends would notice that you seemed to have left.""Lord Kerr said he had never imagined the UK would make use of Article 50. He explained: ""I thought the circumstances in which it would be used, if ever, would be when there was a coup in a member state and the EU suspended that country's membership. ""I thought that at that point the dictator in question might be so cross that he'd say 'right, I'm off' and it would be good to have a procedure under which he could leave."" A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""The UK voted to leave the European Union. The people have spoken and it is now the duty of the government to make sure that happens.""Government lawyers also made clear in legal proceedings before the High Court that, as a matter of firm policy, notification of withdrawal will not be withdrawn."""

In the longer term, in the event that the standing of the City of London were to be diminished, there is concern as to how much will be available in this jurisdiction, where people should be locating, where they should be qualifying and so on.""The society is also warning that uncertainty at the outcome of the 23 June referendum could mean the position of England and Wales as the ""global legal centre"" comes under threat from rivals including New York and Singapore.Mr Bourns said global businesses choose the legal system of England and Wales to resolve disputes but this status could be undermined as the UK plots its post-Brexit course.""Competing jurisdictions are saying English and Welsh law is not as useful as it used to be and perhaps you'd like to use a different jurisdiction,"" he told the BBC.The legal industry employs 370,000 people across England and Wales with a turnover of £26bn - and ""anything that goes towards undermining that would be a problem"", he says.The society also fears multi-national law firms will be damaged by the loss of an EU directive allowing solicitors to work in other member states, saying this could mean complicated negotiations with authorities in each country they operate in.Bad news for England and Wales could be good news for Ireland, where the Law Society is reporting a surge in the numbers of solicitors and barristers applying to practice.MPs are beginning an inquiry into the implications of Brexit  on the justice system, including a focus on the European Arrest Warrant, which the Law Society says must be retained.Once Article 50 negotiations are complete, and the UK leaves, lawyers are likely to be kept busy by the government's Great Repeal Bill, with which it plans to incorporate all EU regulations into UK law, before picking and choosing the ones it wants to keep.""It's absolutely vast,"" said Mr Bourns.""We've been members of the EU for 43 years. There are about 350 directives that are presently in the course of implementation. So what happens to those?""He predicted a ""role for the courts"" in settling disputes about whether EU or UK rules applied in different situations, and questioned what would happen when EU legislation is amended by Brussels after it has been incorporated into UK law.As for what the UK decides to keep, he said the challenge would be to ""ensure we don't inadvertently miss something that means we're disadvantaged"".""Lawyers are very much involved, there's no doubt about that.""Clients are asking, and clients are planning. So there's a lot of work to be done.""But aren't lawyers just talking up the difficulties to make work for themselves?""We will make the very best of it,"" Mr Bourns says.""We are absolutely determined this should be regarded as an opportunity for us - we have no other choice."""

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The government argues ministers already have sufficient powers - under the Royal Prerogative - to do this without MPs and peers having a vote. It has vowed to fight to get the ruling overturned next month in the Supreme Court.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show the prime minister had to be allowed ""latitude"" when negotiating with the EU over Brexit.He said: ""The impact on the economy will be far worse if, through some parliamentary mechanism, Theresa May is forced to lay out her entire negotiating strategy.""Speaking on the way to New Delhi for a trade visit, Mrs May said the government had ""strong arguments"" in its appeal against the High Court's decision. She added that it was important to deliver on UK voters' desire to see a curb on free movement from the EU, Earlier, as she left the UK, the prime minister said: ""The British people, the majority of the British people, voted to leave the European Union. The government is now getting on with that.""She added: ""I want to ensure that we get the best possible deal for the UK as we leave the EU, that's the best possible deal for trading with and operating within the single European market. ""But alongside that, the UK will be a confident, outward-looking nation, taking its place on the world stage, looking to build relationships around the globe.""The row has escalated in recent days, with several newspapers being highly critical of the judges who made the High Court decision, the Daily Mail branding them ""Enemies of the people"".The government says it will not be put off its Brexit timetable. Under this, the two years of negotiations with the EU are due to end in 2019, when the UK will leave the 28-member organisation.Also speaking to Andrew Marr, Ms Miller, the investment manager who was the lead claimant in the High Court case against the government, said: ""Everyone in this country should be my biggest fan, because we have used our own money to create certainty about the way ahead.""She added: ""Do we want a country where we have no process?""""The case is that [Mrs May] cannot use something called the Royal Prerogative to do it because we do not live in a tin-pot dictatorship,"" Ms Miller said.But Mr Farage said the court's decision meant the country was faced with ""half Brexit"", adding that the ""reach of the European Union into the upper echelons of this country makes it quite difficult for us to trust the judgement"".He warned: ""If the people of this country think that they're going to be cheated, they're going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger, the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed.""Asked if there was a danger of disturbances in the street, he replied: ""Yes, I think that's right.""Mr Farage called for those who were in favour of Brexit to take part in peaceful protests and in any election not support people who wanted to overturn the process.Meanwhile, Labour deputy leader Tom Watson told BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: ""We are not going to hold this up. The British people have spoken and Article 50 will be triggered when it comes to Westminster.""He added: ""Ultimately when the vote comes, Labour will support Theresa May to trigger Article 50.""It comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Sunday Mirror: ""The court has thrown a big spanner in the works by saying Parliament must be consulted. We accept the result of the referendum.""We are not challenging the referendum. We are not calling for a second referendum.""But he said Labour would push for the party's ""Brexit bottom lines"", which include access to the European single market. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said political leaders had a ""duty to calm tempers, heal division and work together to keep Britain open, tolerant and united"".And Scotland's Brexit minister, Michael Russell, said he could not imagine any circumstances in which SNP MPs would vote in favour of triggering Article 50."
2016-11-05,Scrap state pension triple-lock say MPs,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37871681,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe ""triple-lock"" on state pensions - which has protected the incomes of the older generation since 2010 - should be scrapped, a committee of MPs has said.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.The Work and Pensions Committee said continuing with it was ""unsustainable"" and ""unfair"" on younger families.The government said it was committed to the triple-lock until 2020 at least.Historically, pensions were linked to inflation rather than earnings, which reduced pensioner incomes relative to those of the working population.As a result of triple-lock policy, the state pension has risen by a relatively generous £1,100 since 2010, with an increase of 2.9% in April this year.However, MPs said that while pensioners had done well out of the triple-lock, young people and working-age families had suffered unfairly.So-called Millennials, born between 1981 and 2000, face being the first generation in modern times to be financially worse off than their predecessors, they added.MPs said the rising cost of the state pension - £98bn in the last tax year - was now unsustainable.Instead of the triple-lock, they say the new state pension and basic state pension could be linked simply to average earnings.They say a formula should also be included to protect pensioners during periods when earnings lag behind price inflation.In those periods, pensioners would get an above-earnings increase so that their purchasing power did not decline.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith defended the introduction of the triple-lock in 2010 because at the time pensioners were ""most likely to be in poverty"".But he told BBC Radio 5 live, this year alone the policy would cost £18bn more than was originally estimated so it was right to re-examine it.Mr Duncan Smith added: ""We still want their pension to grow, but it's the question of the rate of growth that is costing so much and that now needs to be reviewed.""The report said there was a ""trade-off"" between increasing the amount of state pension that people get and setting the age at which people receive it. Simply increasing the state pension age risked further disadvantaging people who may already be worse off and have lower life expectancies. Labour MP Frank Field, the chairman of the committee, said that at the same time as tightening their belts, young people were being asked to support a group that has ""fared relatively well in recent years"".""They've accepted that unfairness so that we could largely eliminate pensioner poverty,"" he told the BBC.""Fairness now means that the pendulum swings back in favour of working families, so they do not continue to have cuts - real cuts - in living standards, while we further advance the interests of pensioners.""A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""We want to ensure economic security for people at every stage of their life, including retirement. We are committed to the triple lock which is protecting the incomes of millions of pensioners.""Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said pensioners were ""being blamed for the problems faced by today's younger generations"".""This phoney conflict is being used as a smokescreen in order to cut back on the welfare state,"" she said.""The housing crisis hasn't been caused by pensioners but because in Britain we sold off council houses, we haven't been building enough affordable homes, wages and employment are low and insecure and an economy built on house-price inflation simply cannot be sustained. ""This is what needs to be addressed."""

The Bar Council had demanded Liz Truss respond to criticism from some MPs and newspapers over the decision that MPs should vote on triggering Article 50.The Daily Mail branded judges ""Enemies of the people""; the Daily Express said it was ""the day democracy died"".Ms Truss said the ""impartiality"" of the courts was ""respected the world over"".On Thursday, the High Court ruled Parliament should vote on when the government can trigger Article 50, beginning the formal process of the UK leaving the EU.Three judges found that the government could not start the formal process by using the royal prerogative alone, and would need the backing of both the Commons and the Lords.The government is seeking to overturn the decision at the Supreme Court - the UK's highest court of appeal - next month.Following fierce criticism of the ruling, the Bar Council of England and Wales - the professional body representing barristers called for Ms Truss to defend the judges ""as a matter of urgency"".But its chairwoman Chantal-Aimee Doerries QC said she would have expected the Lord Chancellor - who is responsible for courts, prisons, probation and constitutional affairs - to make a clearer statement on the ""unprecedented"" attack which  ""undermines the rule of law in this country"".  She said the court was entitled to rule on the case and she was ""surprised by the backlash"" because the judges were ""doing their job"".The Criminal Bar Association later passed a resolution backing the Bar Council's demands.In her statement, Ms Truss, who is also justice secretary, said: ""The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality.""In relation to the case heard in the High Court, the government has made it clear it will appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal process must be followed.""By Ben Wright, BBC News political correspondentIt could not be called a comprehensive response. Having declined all requests for an interview, the Lord Chancellor Liz Truss put out a three-line statement saying the judiciary was independent and impartial. Considering the vitriol of some press reaction to the High Court judges decision - ""enemies of the people"" according to the Daily Mail - and the demands for a defence of the judiciary from Labour and prominent Tory MPs, the government's response was the bare minimum. We know ministers are angry about the ruling and are appealing to the Supreme Court. But given a chance to say newspapers and politicians should be very wary about attacking the judiciary the Lord Chancellor demurred. Nor did she say the courts did have the jurisdiction to rule on this dispute. However, it be a very brave (or foolish?) minister to criticise the press for writing what they like about Brexit. And many voters will share the anger of some newspapers about the decision of the court. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, who had earlier said Ms Truss's silence was ""embarrassing"", called her statement ""too little, much too late"" and said she had failed to ""adequately stand up to attacks on [the] judiciary"".He said ""pressure from the legal profession, professional bodies, politicians and the public has paid off"" and Ms Truss had ""finally made at least some progress on this issue"".But he added: ""All Liz Truss has done is recite the well-known principle of the independence of the judiciary...""The last few days mean that much of the legal community now has no confidence in the Lord Chancellor to fulfil her statutory duty to protect the independence of the British judiciary.""Writing on Twitter, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the response from Ms Truss as a ""weak statement from a weak cabinet minister"".Earlier, Tory MP and former Attorney-General, Dominic Grieve, has compared coverage in one UK newspaper to the Nazi party's newspaper.He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Newspapers in a free society can do what they like.""But if you did decide to behave immoderately and whip up frenzied hatred you can do that in a free society if you set about it, and newspapers like the Daily Mail are no different from the Voelkischer Beobachter in Nazi Germany if they run headlines of that type.""Daily Mail columnist Stephen Glover defended his newspaper's stance, saying he did not believe the judges would ""feel frightened or worried"" by the criticism.He said they had made a ""decisive intervention"" in the political process, and ""must expect some comeback"".UKIP MP Douglas Carswell is among those who have attacked the judges, calling them ""politicians without accountability"".Meanwhile, Gina Miller, the investment manager and philanthropist who led the legal campaign, has said she plans to report online trolls to police after receiving rape and death threats.""I am really cross at the politicians and the media who are whipping this up because they are the ones inciting racism and violence and acrimony,"" she said.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also commented on the row, writing in a tweet: ""Horrified by trolling of judges & those going to court; British values call for honest but good disagreeing, need reconciliation not abuse"".He added independent judges were ""fundamental to our values"" and it was ""wrong to attack them for declaring the law"",Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is ""confident"" the government will win its Supreme Court appeal and is committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017."
2016-11-05,Corbyn wants more Brexit transparency,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37880603,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called on the government to spell out its plans for negotiating Brexit to Parliament ""without delay"".In a speech in London to trade unionists and activists, he said there needed to be more ""transparency"" over how Britain would leave the EU.The High Court ruled on Thursday that MPs should be allowed to vote on triggering Article 50.The government has said it will appeal against the decision.Speaking to the Class think tank, Mr Corbyn said his party ""accepted and respected"" the decision of voters to leave the EU but insisted on ""transparency and accountability"" to Parliament about the government's plans.""I suspect the government opposes democratic scrutiny of its plans because frankly there aren't any plans. ""There are no plans beyond the hollow rhetoric, which they keep on repeating - apparently - that Brexit means Brexit.'' The Labour leader accused Prime Minister Theresa May of reaching ""secret deals"" over Brexit with companies such as Nissan, which confirmed it will build two new models at its Sunderland plant following talks with the government.""We can't have secret deals on Brexit, company by company,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""All our businesses need the kind of assurances that apparently Nissan has had about the shape of the government's Brexit plans to make the right investment decisions.""Mr Corbyn said that after ""six wasted years of austerity and savage cuts"", the Conservatives have started to change their rhetoric towards giving more help to ordinary working-class families. This month's Autumn Statement from the Chancellor Philip Hammond would be ""the test of whether they could back up their rhetoric with meaningful change"", he added.Labour has promised £500bn in investment over a decade in infrastructure improvements to railways, housing, energy and broadband, he said.""A country that doesn't invest is a country that has given up, that has taken the path of managed decline,"" he told delegates.""We offer a different way forward that meets the needs and aspirations of our people in 2016, not a 1980s - or even 1950s - never-never land.""The party leader said a Labour government would also hit out at tax dodging.""This is the message to the tax dodgers - a Labour government will come after you. No more turning a blind eye, no more shabby deals - we will collect the taxes,"" he said.The government has said MPs will get a say over any final deal relating to Brexit.But it is challenging the High Court ruling that states Parliament has the right to vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU. The appeal hearing at the Supreme Court is expected to be in early December."
2016-11-05,Tory MP quits over 'policy differences',https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37872899,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkConservative MP Stephen Phillips has quit over ""irreconcilable policy differences"" with the government.The MP, who has held the Lincolnshire seat of Sleaford and North Hykeham since 2010, backed leaving the EU but has accused ministers of ignoring Parliament since the Brexit vote.He said he was ""unable properly to represent the people who elected me"".It comes as Theresa May said she was confident she would win a legal battle over her approach to Brexit talks. On Thursday, three High Court judges ruled the government cannot officially notify the EU of its intention to leave, thus beginning formal talks, without Parliament's support.In a series of phone calls, the prime minister told European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Germany's Angela Merkel that the government believed it would win its Supreme Court appeal against the ruling and she was committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017.Although Mr Phillips represents a safe Conservative seat, his surprise departure increases the pressure on Mrs May's government - which has a working majority of 17.It is not yet clear whether Mr Phillips, who won the seat last year with a majority of more than 24,000, will stand as an independent in a future by-election although this is thought to be unlikely. by Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondentThe government's values were no longer his values. On child refugees, on the use of aid money, on the handling of Brexit, he dissented from a party he thought was heading inexorably to the right.That is the view from sources close to Stephen Phillips. One said he twice rejected a meeting with the prime minister. Will other Tories follow? Some on the party's left tell me they'd rather stay and fight. Others reflect ruefully that unlike him they have no well-paid alternative career as a barrister.A by-election in a safe seat won't much trouble party bosses. But while Downing Street doesn't want one, the departure of - yet another - Tory MP means the voices calling for a swift general election will grow a little louder.The politician, who is a barrister and part-time Crown Court judge, is the second Conservative MP to stand down in as many weeks - Zac Goldsmith last week forced a by-election over his opposition to expanding Heathrow airport. Sources say Mr Phillips informed party whips earlier this week that he would resign as an MP because he felt his values were not the values of the government.He has been critical of the government's approach to Brexit since June's Leave vote, accusing Theresa May of trying to ""ignore the views"" of Parliament and avoiding scrutiny of the government's negotiating position.In a recent newspaper article, he suggested the government was ""lurching to the right"" and that its attempt to start negotiations with the EU without the explicit approval of Parliament was ""divisive and plain wrong"". In a statement, he did not spell out the specific reasons for his resignation but said: ""It has become clear to me over the last few months that my growing and very significant policy differences with the current government mean that I am unable properly to represent the people who elected me"".However, in a letter to his constituency chairman, Mr Phillips attacked the government for ""shirking"" responsibility for unaccompanied child refugees and changes in the way international aid is spent.Mr Phillips said: ""Some will label me a quitter or, no doubt, worse. Those are labels with which I can live. The label Conservative no longer is.""In last year's election, Mr Phillips won a majority of 24,115, with 56% of the vote. Labour finished second, closely followed by UKIP. Labour said the impending by-election would be ""more about Tory failure and in-fighting than what is in the best interests of the country"".""It's clear that even Theresa May's own MPs realise that she has failed to lay out a convincing plan to deliver for Britain,"" said national campaign co-ordinator Jon Trickett.UKIP leadership contender Suzanne Evans has said she would like to be considered to be the party's candidate in the by-election.Asked about the resignation during a visit to Berlin, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested it was part of the prevailing ""sturm und drang"" (storm and stress) over Brexit - a reference to the movement of 18th Century German writers who gave free expression to emotions and ideas which sought to break with tradition. He told reporters he did not believe that the legal battle over Parliament's role would ""interfere"" with the UK's Brexit timetable - insisting that the High Court ruling was ""one stage"" in the legal process and the British people had made their views clear.Mrs May has also been seeking to reassure EU leaders about the UK's commitment to Brexit following Thursday's legal setback.No 10 said she had explained the government was ""disappointed"" by the ruling but felt it ""had strong legal arguments ahead of the case moving to the Supreme Court"".The European Commission said the timetable for beginning talks was in the UK's hands.""The president explicitly said the legal order and the constitutional order of the UK will be respected and we won't speculate on a possible delay,"" a spokeswoman said.The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The EU's other 27 member states have said negotiations about the terms of the UK's exit - due to last two years - cannot begin until Article 50 has been invoked."
2016-11-05,PM 'confident' over Brexit case appeal,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37868987,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May has said she is ""confident"" that the government will win its appeal against a High Court ruling on triggering Brexit talks.She told European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Germany's Angela Merkel she was committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017.Three judges ruled that she cannot do so without Parliament's support.It comes as a Conservative MP said he was quitting due to ""irreconcilable"" differences with the government.Stephen Phillips has been among Tory MPs pushing for Parliament to be consulted over the UK's strategy for negotiating its exit from the EU, accusing ministers of trying to ""ignore their views"". The government is appealing against Thursday's ruling to the Supreme Court - all 11 judges are due to hear the case in early December.If it loses its appeal, it is expected that the government will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on. The prime minister's spokesman said she had expressed ""disappointment"" at Thursday's court ruling in a phone call to Mr Juncker and Mrs Merkel but had said ""the focus of the government is on the Supreme Court case. We are confident of winning that case and proceeding with Article 50"".But former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg - now the Lib Dems' Europe spokesman - said his party would seek to join with others ""in both the Commons and the Lords to amend the legislation"" to tell the government to pursue a ""soft Brexit"" that would keep the UK within the EU's single market. ""If they believe the government is pursuing an unnecessarily hard, in other words an unnecessarily self-harming version of Brexit, then of course MPs should be free to reject that,"" he told the BBC. Conservative peer Lady Wheatcroft told BBC Radio 4's Today she was willing to table an amendment to future legislation to delay the Brexit process, saying it was ""only right to delay triggering Article 50 until we have a clearer idea of what it actually entails"".But former Conservative cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told the programme: ""Frankly I think it would be a constitutional outrage if unelected Liberal Democrat peers were to stand in the way of implementing the clear result of a referendum in which 33 million people took part."" On Friday, German foreign minister Walter Steinmeier reiterated the German government's desire to see Article 50 triggered quickly at a Berlin press conference with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, ruling out any ""preliminary discussions"" before then.Boris Johnson's opening quip that (unlike his wife) he is not a Berliner did little to improve a rather frosty joint press conference after his first official bilateral meeting with his German counterpart Frank Walter Steinmeier.It is Mr Johnson's first visit as foreign secretary to Berlin, where he's widely regarded - in some cases with contempt - as being directly responsible for Britain's decision to leave the EU.This wasn't the outcome the German government hoped for. But now the decision's made they'd rather Britain just got on with it. Mr Steinmeier - who looked unimpressed by Mr Johnson's assertion that Brexit represented an opportunity - emphasised the need for the British government to trigger Article 50 as soon as possible. His priority, he added, was to the remaining 27 member states. Thursday's High Court ruling found that the government could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty alone, without the backing of Parliament - which would require publishing legislation to be debated by the Commons and the Lords.It was met with furious newspaper headlines, with the Daily Mail describing the judges involved as ""enemies of the people"" - which in turn sparked a social media backlash. Chantal-Aimee Doerries QC, chairman of the Bar Council, told BBC News the ""attack on judges"" and their role was ""extremely concerning"": ""The rule of law sits in our democracy as a cornerstone and it is important for our judiciary to rule on questions of the rule of law. If we do not respect the independent judiciary in that role we put at risk our democracy.""Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon called on Justice Secretary Liz Truss to speak out against the ""hysterical headlines"" while Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the Guardian the attacks on the judiciary were ""entirely unjustified"".But UKIP leadership contender Suzanne Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics: ""Judges are allowing pressure groups and campaigners to bring cases for judicial review and making rulings which would not stand up to scrutiny at the ballot box.""The government's appeal is expected to be heard in early December by the full Supreme Court for the first time in its history.The judgement may not be handed down until January.If the appeal fails, it is thought the government will then have to bring forward legislation - which would have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament.The bill could be subject to amendments. MPs and peers may push for more details of the government's negotiating strategy or possibly for a second referendum.The government wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017 so any legislation would need to be approved by then if the timetable is not to be pushed back.The government has argued that it cannot ""show its hand in detail"" ahead of negotiations with 27 other EU member states, despite calls from MPs to clarify her plans.For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that while she thought ""that in the end Parliament will vote for Article 50 to be triggered"" the judgement meant the government would have to give MPs ""some basic terms on which they are going to negotiate Brexit"".

2016-11-05,US sports anchor abused in Brexit mix-up,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37869797,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA US sports presenter has been flooded with online abuse after being mistaken for Brexit campaigner Gina Miller.Texas-based namesake Gina Miller was initially bemused to be branded a traitor who had ""ruined our democracy"".She said she received several hundreds of messages, including death threats, adding: ""It was absolutely vitriolic"".It came after the High Court ruled that Theresa May must seek Parliamentary approval before invoking Article 50 to start formal EU exit negotiations.London's Gina Miller, an investment manager and philanthropist, was the lead claimant in the case and was widely photographed and quoted in media coverage of the decision.Brexit court case: Who is Gina Miller?The US-based Ms Miller said she first became aware of the London investment manager's legal moves in October, after a few people mixed up the two women's Twitter addresses. But she said Thursday's ""crazy"" Brexit backlash took her completely by surprise.""On Twitter, on Facebook - there were some f-bombs, lots of people saying I was a traitor. 'You're ruining our democracy', 'F-off and move to France' - and much more'.She added: ""I even had an email. In the subject box it said: 'I hope you die, I sincerely hope you get cancer and die'.""Having visited the UK on previous occasions, Ms Miller said: ""It was in overwhelming contrast to the very proper, polite British behaviour I'd seen before.""  The London-based Ms Miller, 51, who was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain, has not answered those critics who have targeted her on social media. But speaking outside the High Court on Thursday, she said she was aware of being called a ""black widow spider"" and had suffered abuse from those in favour of leaving the EU.She said: ""That nickname is wrong on so many levels. But I do not and will not let other people bring me down. I believe that level of abuse means I am doing something right for investors.""She did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.The American Gina Miller, who is also a multi-media consultant with Smith Geiger, a market research and strategy group, said: ""If I were counselling her, I'd suggest she be a little bit more overt [on social media]. ""You have to expect some sort of reaction - and it's better to take ownership of it.""One of the legal groups that brought the case to the High Court, Mishcon de Reya, previously said that a number of other clients who wanted to join the action withdrew their names after receiving letters of abuse.Yet for US-based Ms Miller, the abuse has introduced her to a whole new fanbase - boosting her number of followers on Twitter to 28,000 - who can now keep up with her daily insights on American football and baseball.To make it clear, she did tweet: ""Again, to my new UK-friends: Wrong Gina Miller. It's @thatginamiller you want. Appreciate all the engaging dialog though.""She later said: ""The tide began to shift when they realised I was the wrong Gina Miller - with lots of people saying they were sorry. ""I started talking to some of them about soccer - one even asked me what I thought of Queen's Park Rangers' manager."" She added: ""I'll take them, I hope they'll stay - if they want to chat about sports, I'm their girl."" "
2016-11-05,Glenda Jackson back on stage as King Lear,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37876137,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkGlenda Jackson has made a ""ferocious"" and ""magnetic"" return to the stage after a 25-year break. The Oscar-winning actress and former MP received glowing reviews for her lead performance in Shakespeare's King Lear.Deborah Warner's modern-dress production opened at London's Old Vic on Friday night. Its starry cast also includes Celia Imrie, Jane Horrocks and Rhys Ifans. The action mainly unfolds on a sparse set consisting of large white panels. As the Fool, Notting Hill star Ifans wears a tattered Superman suit, sings like Bob Dylan, and, at one point, dons a scary clown mask. In another scene, Ab Fab star Horrocks, as Lear's daughter Regan, playfully lobs an ""eyeball"" into the audience. Jackson, 80, gave up acting for politics a quarter of a century ago and served as a Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn for 23 years, stepping down prior to the general election in 2015.One of the biggest laughs of the night came after a line in the play about ""scurvy politicians"". The Old Vic's artistic director Matthew Warchus said he felt ""very honoured"" that the actress had chosen to make her stage return in his theatre.""I've asked her several times in the last 25 years if she'd be interested, but this time she was ready,"" he told the BBC. ""She came to me in the office and we walked on the stage together and she was primed and eager to come back. ""I asked her what she wanted to do and she said 'I want to play King Lear'. He went on: ""She's got that incredible voice. Obviously she's been using it as a politician so it's never lost any of its muscle."" The critics were largely in agreement. The Guardian's Michael Billington said Jackson had ended her 25-year absence with ""a ferocious, unflinching performance"" that transcended gender. ""Jackson, like all the best Lears, shifts in a moment between madness and sanity, anger and tenderness, vocal force and physical frailty,"" he said. The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish said Jackson made a ""tremendous"" Lear.""No ifs, no buts... she has pulled off one of those 11th-hour feats of human endeavour that will surely be talked about for years to come by those who see it.""Anne Treneman, in The Times, observed: ""The cast is stellar and the brightest of all is Glenda Jackson"".  ""Thanks to its magnetic star this show is undeniably theatrical,"" Quentin Letts wrote in his Daily Mail review. ""Lear played by a woman? Daft, but you are forced to take notice. This is showbusiness, after all.""She makes for a shrivelled Lear, lined as a walnut, scuttling, hobbling, flicking her unisex fringe and waving two distractingly large, washerwomanish hands as though in semaphore."" Actress Celia Imrie, who plays Lear's scheming daughter Goneril, told the BBC she had known Jackson for 41 years having been her ""tea-girl"" on a tour of Hedda Gabler. ""It's wonderful that we know each other, especially as she says such horrible things to me during the course of the play,"" she said. ""What a way to come back,"" she added. ""What is quite astonishing is that you don't have any doubt during the play that she is a king. I'm very proud to be in it.""She said rehearsals had been ""quite full on"" because ""it's a monster of a play"". ""Her brilliant power has never faltered since day one,"" she said, ""and has never faltered from when I knew her 41 years ago.""Warchus added: ""The Old Vic is a stage that's had a lot of great performance on it in its time and it was like watching a little piece of history being made tonight.""

Mr Whittle, the party's culture spokesman and a former London mayoral candidate, added that the ""sheer breadth of Paul's political experience, his dedication to the values of the party and the obvious affection in which he is held by members make him the person who is best placed to take us forward"".Nigel Farage is back as interim leader after his successor Diane James quit just 18 days into the job.Mr Kassam, a former aide to Mr Farage, had endorsed Mr Whittle after himself pulling out of the race.

2016-11-05,Thousands of smaller schools 'unviable',https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-37860682,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThousands of smaller primaries and secondaries in England are becoming financially unviable, heads say.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) says one-form entry primaries and secondaries with 600 pupils or fewer will ""fall off a cliff"" financially unless new funds are found.The government says it has been protecting school budgets.Independent experts say they face real-terms cuts of 8% to cover cost rises in pension, pay and national insurance. The Institute of Fiscal Studies says having been insulated from real-terms cuts over the last Parliament, schools are likely to feel the pinch more over the current Parliament, with spending per pupil set to fall. A one-form entry primary has about 210 pupils, 65 fewer than the average-sized primary school.Some 20% of primaries (3,478) in England have fewer than 200 pupils, and 30% (5,037) have fewer than 300 pupils.The average-sized 11-to-16 secondary has about 970 pupils, while a three-form secondary has about 450 pupils and a four-form primary has about 600.Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL, told the BBC: ""At some smaller schools, the funding will become such that they would not be able to support their teaching infrastructure. ""They will not be financially viable.""One-form entry primary schools, and three- to four-form entry secondary schools, are going to find it extremely difficult, especially in low-funded education authorities.""This size of school is quite common, and they are under real threat.""They are going to find it extremely difficult to provide a full curriculum and maintain the support staff infrastructure needed to run the school.""It's all down to the cost pressures that have come home to roost - the unfunded pay rises, national insurance costs and pension contributions.""He said with continuing delays to the publication of the long-awaited new national funding formula for England's schools, due now to be introduced in 2018, were really struggling.Education is devolved in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so the national governments deal with the funding of their own schools.And some areas have greater numbers of smaller schools than others. In Oxfordhsire, nearly 40% of primary schools have fewer than 200 pupils, for example.""The big, big issue is because [the Department for Education] is not doing anything until 2018, they really need to do something for schools who are going to fall off a cliff financially or run into a wall in 2017,"" said Mr Trobe.He suggested schools might find solutions to their funding issues by sharing specialist teachers with a group of neighbouring schools.Alternatively, they might choose to share some of their support services with other schools.The Department for Education said: ""In reality the schools budget has been protected and in 2016-17 totals over £40bn, the highest ever on record. ""The government's fairer funding proposals will ensure that areas with the highest need attract the most funding and end the historic unfairness in the system."""

2016-11-05,UKIP leadership: Runners and riders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37567690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUKIP is holding a fresh leadership contest after the recently-elected Diane James unexpectedly quit after 18 days in the post. Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-05,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."
2016-11-05,Special relationship?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37851551,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkDonald Trump could be elected president of the United States next week. But what plans has the UK got in place for this eventuality and what could it mean for its place in the world?Picture the scene. It is 20 January 2017 and a cold wind is blowing across Washington's Capitol as Donald John Trump raises his right hand and proclaims that he will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.As he looks the chief justice in the eye, hundreds of millions of people around the world wonder what his four-year term will bring.Among them are UK civil servants and politicians, pondering - with negotiations for leaving the European Union also soon to begin - what all this means for their country.It could happen. So, how well prepared is the UK for dealing with Mr Trump, who has never previously held elected office, and how is the future looking?The UK and US share a language and much cultural heritage, but, argues Tim Oliver, a fellow in European-North American relations at the London School of Economics, the truly ""special"" quality in their relationship is the sharing of intelligence, as well as co-operation over nuclear weapons and special forces.Mr Oliver says there is a risk this could ""sour"" because of the ""degree of distrust and unease"" felt by the government towards Mr Trump, ""an erratic president who appears willing to do anything when it comes to torture, bombing, relations with authoritarian states"".Critics accuse Mr Trump of isolationism, but he describes his foreign policy stance as one of ""Americanism, not globalism"". He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.The UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?""A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,"" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. ""But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.""Before the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to ""the back of the queue"" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.His trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he ""absolutely"" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.""I could see that happening,"" says Ms Schake, ""especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  ""A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.""Mr Trump's website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.Theresa May has not offered an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".Asked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: ""I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.""The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,"" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.Tony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. More trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.The problem is, Ms Schake argues, that ""Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding"", adding: ""But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.""Personal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.""Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,"" says Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government.""Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.""I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?""Many mainstream Republicans have criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush as well as Mr McCain.We know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, would be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr Trump is a hugely famous man, with a long career in business and a career in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many ""known unknowns"", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.Another complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.Then, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with ""unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next"".""I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,"" says Ms Rutter.""If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.""

For the first time, all 11 of the court's permanent justices, including those from Northern Ireland and Scotland, are expected to preside over the case, but who are they?Supreme Court president Lord NeubergerLord Neuberger, 68, is the president of the Supreme Court, a position he has held since 2012, and is the UK's most senior judge.

2016-11-05,May's Delhi dilemma,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37872792,"On Sunday Theresa May will land in smoggy Delhi with a large entourage of diplomats, advisers, business people and press in tow.This is an important visit. It is the new British prime minister's first bilateral meeting outside Europe, the first step in her mission to ""forge a new global role for the UK"".  It is obvious why she has chosen India. Where better to demonstrate the world of opportunity that awaits a post-Brexit Britain?India is now the world's fastest growing large economy, with GDP growth of more than 7% a year and a 1.25 billion-strong market of increasingly wealthy consumers. There should be a lot of warm words about the two countries' long-standing ties, their special relationship and their shared values.  The Indian Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, was already talking of co-operation and future partnerships when I interviewed him on Thursday.But do not be deceived by the diplomatic dance.  Diwali, the festival of lights - India's great seasonal celebration of optimism and hope - has just finished.  It is a time of extraordinary generosity. People throw lavish parties with delicious food, plenty of drink and raucous rounds of Teen Patti - India's answer to poker.I attended a string of these in New Delhi's gracious diplomatic district. Each brought more evidence that India's Diwali generosity does not extend to trade deals with the UK or anyone else.There was the top Indian diplomat who dismissed Mrs May's visit as ""an afterthought"".  He had arrived in a sleek, black BMW. The white Hindustan Ambassadors that used to be the badge of status in India's rigid governmental hierarchy are not so prized any more.The British asked for Mrs May's visit to be brought forward from December and he told me: ""This is about politics in the UK, not about what we want.""Informal trade talks have already started, again at Britain's behest.  Under EU rules,the UK cannot do any actual deals until it leaves Europe, but with a ""hard Brexit"" - where it leaves the single market - looking a real possibility, it wants to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.""Good luck with that,"" laughed the ambassador of a major economic power as he sipped from a flute of champagne at another Diwali do. ""We've been trying to get a deal for years now, but there's not much in it for India.""India was a closed economy until the early 1990s, he explained and still has comparatively high barriers to foreign imports. Meanwhile most of the developed world has been cutting back restrictions on trade.""What's more,"" continued my new friend, ""it's doing well behind those barriers. It means they want really big concessions before they'll sign up to anything.""  The European Union had the same problem.   Peter Mandelson began free trade talks between the EU and India when he was European trade commissioner back in 2007. There have been 16 separate formal rounds of negotiations in the nine years since then, but very little progress.You only need to look at the sticking points to see why the UK is unlikely to fare any better, says Sir Thomas Harris, a former ambassador to Korea who ran the UK India Business Council for many years.  India consistently refused to lift restrictions on professional services including accounting, insurance, banking and legal services, he points out. These are some of Britain's strongest sectors and exactly the kind of businesses to which Britain wants India to open up.""For the life of me, I cannot see why the Indians would be prepared to offer concessions on services in bilateral talks with the UK which they were not prepared to offer in return for access to the EU as a whole,"" he says.And then there is the even more vexed question of immigration.During the trade talks, Europe refused India's requests for more temporary visas for professional workers.  On the face of it, Mrs May's government is unlikely to be any more forthcoming. Its policy is that the number of immigrants needs to be cut dramatically.  At the Conservative Party conference last month, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, talked about the possibility of new curbs on foreign workers and students.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has since hinted he is minded to be a little more flexible on professional workers. But it is hard to overstate how badly the government's rhetoric on immigration goes down in India.""The impression Britain is giving to countries such as India is 'we want your business but we don't want your people',"" is how a former advisor to the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, put it in an Indian newspaper.When I quoted that to a top British diplomat he squirmed in discomfort. ""The government is going to have to find a way to articulate its policy more clearly,"" was his ""diplomatic"" suggestion.Mrs May's visit to India is the first big test of whether it can do that.If Britain is to prosper, Mrs May needs to be able to show that forging strong non-EU alliances can be reconciled with her hard-line stance on immigration. She also needs to demonstrate that it is possible to do trade deals that deliver real benefits to Britain.My Diwali party circuit suggests both ambitions are going to be hard to fulfil.   "
2016-11-05,Gina Miller profile,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37861888,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkGina Miller has been the lead claimant in the legal fight to get Parliament to vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU - but who is she?Ms Miller, 51, is an investment manager and philanthropist who was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain.According to her online LinkedIn page, she attended Moira House Girls' School, in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and then went to university in London.She is reported to have previously been a model and a chambermaid, but is best known for having campaigned for transparency in investment and pension funds.She co-founded the investment firm SCM Private in 2009.She and her hedge fund manager husband, Alan, launched their True and Fair Foundation - formerly known as Miller Philanthropy - in 2009.The foundation says it supports smaller charities by providing funding and support. Charity Commission records show it spent £135,982 in 2015.Ms Miller also launched the True and Fair Campaign in 2012, which campaigns against mis-selling and hidden fund charges in the City of London's fund management industry.According to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the ""black widow spider"".Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.""Ms Miller launched the Brexit legal case along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.They argued the government could not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - starting the formal process of the UK leaving the EU - without seeking approval from Parliament.Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the case.Ms Miller argued that only Parliament could make a decision leading to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.But she has stressed throughout that the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now.""On November 3, three judges ruled Parliament must vote on when the process can begin.Speaking after the verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"".  She said: ""What we're saying is, very simply, you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about getting back a sovereign Parliament and being in control but at the same time then bypass it.""Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.""This case is far more fundamental than that.  It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament. ""We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship.""She has described herself as neither a leave, not a remain campaigner.Asked whether she was ""a remainer to your boots"", she told BBC's Andrew Marr Show she had campaigned for ""remain, reform and review"" during the referendum.But she said the case was now not about the referendum result, but ""how we leave the EU"".""The elephant in the room is actually about leaving the EU, it is not about reversing leaving the EU.""The case is that she cannot use something called the royal prerogative to do it, because we do not live in a tinpot dictatorship, we live in a country that has a sovereign Parliament.""She told UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the programme that ""everyone in the country"" should be her ""biggest fan"" following the controversial court case.""This is about creating legal certainty and actually, everyone in the country should be my biggest fan because I've used my own money and a few of us we have used our own money to create legal certainty for Mrs May to move ahead.""Some newspapers have focussed on Ms Miller's private life, and her former marriage. However, she said ""everyone has a past"" and it was ""totally irrelevant"" to the importance of the case.She has also spoken about the abuse she suffered following the ruling.""I was aware there would be nastiness because anything to do with the word Brexit, people lose their minds and it's all about heart. Actually it is about your head and your heart.""She told BBC Radio 5 live she plans to report online trolls to police after receiving rape and beheading threats.She also told the Andrew Marr Show she was appalled by fierce criticism of the High Court judges who ruled on the case in the press.Ms Miller said ""that is unforgivable"", saying she is ""a nobody and they are ""the biggest brains in this country"". ""They are what make us great. """
2016-11-05,Brexit battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37877128,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA High Court ruling that Parliament - not the government alone - can trigger Article 50 threatens to delay Theresa May's timetable for leaving the EU, but could it spell the end for Brexit altogether?Downing Street says it is confident that the Supreme Court will overrule the High Court and allow ministers, rather than MPs, to decide when to begin the formal process of leaving the EU.But there is no evidence that government lawyers have yet amassed new arguments that might persuade the highest court in the land that the three eminent judges reached the wrong conclusion on Thursday.So if that ruling stands, then the relevant secretary of state, David Davis - in charge of the process of exiting the EU -  has said his presumption is that an Act of Parliament would be required before triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. No 10 has said that's the 'logical conclusion' of the ruling, too.Incidentally a former Conservative leader - Iain Duncan Smith - disagrees, and believes a straightforward vote of MPs would satisfy the courts.But let's assume government ministers are right.Could the mere act of consulting largely pro-Remain MPs scupper Brexit?Well, no.Although the former chancellor Ken Clarke and the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg have told the BBC that they are prepared to vote against invoking Article 50, enough Remainers are saying they would respect the result of the referendum and vote to start the process of leaving the EU. The government would not lose this vote.More likely is delay - rather than destruction - of Brexit.But the opportunities for delay depend in part on the form any legislation would take.Some pro-Brexit politicians are urging the government to come up with a simple one-line bill triggering Article 50.The shorter and simpler the legislation, the more difficult it would be for Remainers to put forward elaborate amendments attempting to tie the government's hands in subsequent negotiations with the EU.The former attorney general Dominic Grieve reckons that amendments could still be permitted, so long as they were addressed to the narrow substance of the bill.This could allow, for example, an amendment to hold a second referendum on the final deal negotiated by the government, given that those negotiations were triggered by the Article 50 process - the option favoured by the former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith.Even assuming that all amendments were defeated or ruled out of order, any legislation at all carries a risk for the government.That's because it needs to be approved not just by the Commons but by the Lords.And many pro-Remain unelected peers might be less squeamish than MPs about voting against Article 50.If - and it's a big if - that were to happen, then the government would have to use the Parliament Acts to overrule them. Peers cannot stop legislation outright - they can simply force a rethink.That would delay the process by about a year - scuppering not Brexit itself, but Theresa May's promise to start the process by the end of March 2017.It might also extend our membership of the EU until just after the next general election, in the spring of 2020.Some pro-Brexit Conservatives are already urging the prime minister to call an early election under these circumstances, on a platform of standing up for ""the people"" against ""the peers"".With the party's lead in the polls, they calculate that this would strengthen the government's mandate.  But, given the complications and potential consequences of yesterday's ruling, you can understand why minsters are keeping their fingers firmly crossed that the Supreme Court will overturn it."
2016-11-05,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161106051440/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37876851,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkWith the permission of the Queen, prime ministers used to be able to call a general election at a time of their choosing. The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if she wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy.The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government. The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020. The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do. Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour.It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election. Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy.More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this. An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections. In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.  "

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

There is some debate about whether a vote at Westminster on invoking Article 50 would require a full Act of Parliament, or whether it could happen much more speedily by MPs and peers agreeing to a resolution - a written motion - instead.Asked about this, Mrs May suggested that she would expect the court to set out which of the two options would be required.She said: ""If it were the case that the Supreme Court were to uphold the view of the High Court, then the judgement would set out what the details were.""In recent days, the idea of an early election has been raised, but Mrs May said: ""I've been clear the next general election should be in 2020. ""The government is getting on with the job in delivering what people voted for on 23 June which was for Britain to leave the European Union. We're going to put that in to practice.""  In June's UK-wide referendum, voters opted by 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of leaving the EU.Earlier on Monday, Brexit Secretary David Davis gave the government's official response to the High Court's ruling, telling MPs the referendum result ""must be respected and delivered"".He added: ""There must be no attempt to remain inside the EU now, attempting it behind the back door or a second referendum.""For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to have a vote on the issue, as it was ""sovereign"" and, because of this, ""that scrutiny matters"". However, his party would not ""frustrate"" the process of invoking Article 50, he added.He told MPs the government's approach was ""unravelling"" in an ""ugly way"", adding: ""We saw a series of appalling personal attacks on the judges, including the suggestion that they were 'enemies of the people'."" This was a reference to a headline used in the Daily Mail on Friday - the day after the High Court's decision.Mr Davis insisted that ""we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary"", but defended the freedom of the press. ""Both these things underpin our democracy,"" he said.Suzanne Evans, one of the three candidates for the UKIP leadership contest, told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme that judges could be ""subject to some kind of democratic control"" following the High Court's decision.She did not want to undermine ""their judicial independence"", but added: ""I suppose that in this case, we have had a situation where we have judges committed to stay in the European Union...""I'm questioning the legitimacy of this particular case. We know that the legal profession threw a collective hissy fit when we voted to leave.""Scotland's Brexit minister, the SNP's Michael Russell, said he could not imagine any circumstances in which his party's MPs would vote in favour of triggering Article 50."
2016-11-06,Current Indian visa system 'good' - May,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37891734,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May has rejected calls to relax Indian visa rules, saying the UK has a ""good system"" for applications.The prime minister, who is in Delhi to pave the way for the UK's first post-Brexit trade deal, said the UK was already able to attract ""the brightest and the best"" from outside the EU.""Nine out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted,"" she said.But she said the UK could give ground if Indians who overstayed their visas could be returned more swiftly.""The UK will consider further improvements to our visa offer if, at the same time, we can step up the speed and volume of returns of Indians with no right to remain,"" she told reporters.Her government also intends to make it easier for wealthy Indian business executives to come to the UK.A small group of high-net-worth individuals and their families will be offered access to the Great Club - a bespoke visa and immigration service - to make visa applications smoother.Thousands of Indians on work visas will also be able to join the Registered Travellers Scheme which will mean they can get through UK border controls more quickly.""As we leave the EU, we want to ensure that the UK remains one of the most attractive countries in the world to do business and invest,"" Mrs May said.The prime minister flew into Delhi late last night to be greeted by the worst smog this city has seen in nearly 20 years.  Where better to get a taste of life beyond the EU - than India. With such deep historical links between the two countries - surely the UK can cut through the bureaucratic smog that saw Brussels spend nearly a decade negotiating, but ultimately fail to agree a deal with the world's fastest growing economy. But Indian business leaders are confused. No-one knows what the UK's relationship with Europe will eventually look like, and many are unsure about how much can be usefully discussed until the UK has withdrawn from the EU - a point that is at least two years away. Some things are clear and all too familiar. Trade and immigration are linked. If the UK wants better access to Indian markets, the government in Delhi wants a looser approach to UK work and student visas. This week saw Britain's visa rules for foreign visitors tightened. Specific deals will be announced over the next 24 hours but more clarity around a trade relationship that has stagnated or even declined in recent years is likely to remain enveloped in the Delhi smog. Visa issues risk dominating Theresa May's first trade trip since becoming prime minister.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a technology summit in Delhi he wanted to encourage ""greater mobility"" for its young people in education. He said: ""Education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. ""We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.""Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria earlier said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years.He said ""movement of people"" would form a key part of any trade negotiations.The number of study visas issued to Indian nationals fell from 68,238 in the year to June 2010 to 11,864 five years later, official UK figures show.The solution, according to Karan Bilimoria, is to exclude foreign students from Britain's statistics on net migration, which Mrs May has pledged to cut to below 100,000 annually - down from 336,000 in the year to June 2015.""We need to immediately get the government, Theresa May, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures,'"" crossbencher Lord Bilimoria told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.He added: ""The reality is Theresa May when she was home secretary did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration.""""She has got a lot of bridge-building to do when she goes to India.""Mrs May will be accompanied on the three-day trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and trade minister Greg Hands as well as representatives from 33 UK companies.Deals expected to be confirmed during the trip include:"
2016-11-06,Lower benefits cap comes into force,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37873922,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA single mother has told the BBC she fears losing her home, on the day the new benefits cap is introduced.Emma Bradley, who has four children, including a baby, said she could be left £76 a week short on her rent unless she finds work.The cap - which limits the income households receive in certain benefits - has been reduced from £26,000 a year to £20,000 a year outside London.The government says the cap is ""a clear incentive to move into a job"".But the policy has been criticised by campaigners and unions.The GMB union described the lower cap as ""a monstrous new assault on 40,000 single mothers, which risks shattering the life chances of children up and down our country"".Under the new system, Ms Bradley's benefits will be capped unless she works at least 16 hours a week.Speaking to BBC Breakfast on the day the new system was introduced, the mother-of-four from Coventry said she would ""quite happily work"", but the childcare costs and the job of looking after her four children made it much harder to do so.She said she was having sleepless nights worrying about how she would find a job to fit around her family, saying: ""If I lose the house, which could happen, it is scary to think 'what would I do?'.""The earliest free childcare provision is offered is when a child is aged two.The Gingerbread group, which campaigns for single parents, said 43,700 single parents with a child under the age of five would be hit by the cap.""The new benefit cap is likely to drive more single parents into poverty. Many will have to choose between the roof over their children's heads and other essentials such as food and heating,"" said Gingerbread policy officer Laura Dewar.But ministers say the level of the cap is fair because it is close to the average salary after tax. The Department for Work and Pensions described it as ""a clear incentive to move into a job"".The current Work and Pensions Secretary, Damian Green, said it was wrong that some claimants could receive more in benefits than the average wage.He said the government was making it ""as easy as possible"" for claimants to get work, by offering free childcare offers and structuring benefits to encourage people in to employment.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he denied that children of single parents who do not work were being ""condemned"" by the changes.""I'm not saying that lone parents have to go and find a full-time job. If they want to avoid the benefit cap they only have to be working 16 hours a week and we will be providing free childcare to enable them to do that,"" he said.The cap - which, in total, is now set to affect an estimated 88,000 households primarily with high rents or large families - relates to a string of benefits for those aged 16 to 64 including child tax credit, housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance and income support, but excludes some others such as disability living allowance. Households where someone works more than 16 hours a week are exempt. Under the new cap, those living in the UK outside of Greater London will receive a maximum of:The limits are higher for those living in Greater London boroughs. The new cap is:Those affected will most likely see their housing benefit amount being cut, but the changes are expected to take a few weeks to be fully implemented.Research by the Chartered Institute of Housing suggests 320,000 children will be affected (estimating 115,000 households are impacted) with families losing up to £100 a week.The cap will save the Treasury an estimated £100m a year in the long run, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) - only a fraction of the total £12bn cuts to welfare spending over this parliament.But the IFS questioned whether the policy would actually have the desired effect. The lower cap would fail to move the majority of those affected into work or prompt them to downsize their home, it said.Speaking to the BBC shortly after resigning as work and pensions secretary in March, Iain Duncan Smith hit out at the ""arbitrary"" decision to lower the welfare cap. He questioned why working-age benefits were hit while pensioner benefits were protected.A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""We are committed to helping lone parents into a job which fits in around their caring responsibilities, which is why we are doubling the amount of free childcare available.""We know that work is the best route out of poverty, and there are now record numbers of lone parents in work.""The benefit cap provides a clear incentive to move into a job, even if it is part time, as anyone eligible for working tax credits is exempt.""Even with the new cap, lone parents can still receive benefits up to the equivalent salary of £25,000, or £29,000 in London.""Some discretionary funds are available for people struggling to pay their rent.Will you be affected by the cap?

The government argues ministers already have sufficient powers - under the Royal Prerogative - to do this without MPs and peers having a vote. It has promised to fight to get the ruling overturned next month in the Supreme Court. It says the High Court's decision will not affect its Brexit timetable, but this has not prevented fierce criticism of the ruling from some newspapers, who fear it could open up the possibility of delays.Labour has said it will not seek to delay the triggering of Article 50, but some Remain-supporting MPs, including ex-Conservative minister Ken Clarke and former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, have told the BBC that they are prepared to vote against it.The SNP's Brexit Minister Mike Russell has also told BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme he ""can't imagine"" any circumstances in which his party's 54 MPs would vote to trigger it.On her way to Delhi for a visit to promote UK-India trade, Mrs May said: ""I believe in and value the independence of our judiciary. I also value the freedom of our press. I think these both underpin our democracy and they are important. ""Of course the judges will look at the legal arguments. We think we have strong legal arguments and we will be taking those arguments to the Supreme Court.""Analysis: John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editor, travelling with the prime ministerAt 37,000 feet, above the roar of the engines propelling the prime minister's official RAF Voyager aircraft towards Delhi, Theresa May's verdict on the raging ""Press v judges"" dispute was heard loud and clear in the crowded cabin.""I value the independence of the judiciary,"" she said. ""I also value the freedom of the press.""The latter was ""important to democracy"", she added.True, no prime minister would ever offer anything other than an unqualified endorsement of press freedom if invited to do so. But Mrs May repeated the words twice. Those who were outraged by the strength of the papers' attacks, and even saw the criticism as an assault on the independence of the judiciary, will be far less pleased than the editors framing the morning editions.Read more from John PienaarSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, UKIP leader Mr Farage said the court's decision meant the country was faced with ""half Brexit"", adding the ""reach of the European Union into the upper echelons of this country makes it quite difficult for us to trust the judgement"".He warned: ""If the people of this country think that they're going to be cheated, they're going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger, the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed."" Asked if there was a danger of disturbances in the street, he replied: ""Yes, I think that's right.""But the campaigner who brought the High Court case said it would stop ministers acting like a ""tin-pot dictatorship"".Investment manager Gina Miller told the BBC: ""Everyone in this country should be my biggest fan, because we have used our own money to create certainty about the way ahead.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party ""respected the result of the referendum"", adding that ""Article 50 will be invoked and there will be negotiations"".He said: ""We are part of the negotiations, and we are very tough on this. We want to see Britain having a trading relationship with Europe and protections maintained for British workers.""Mr Corbyn called on the government to reveal its negotiating strategy, arguing: ""We can't have a prime minister obfuscating and hiding behind the idea that she has some executive authority which she clearly does not have. Parliament has the authority.""But the government said that to give its stance away ahead of Article 50 being invoked would be counterproductive, putting it at a disadvantage when it negotiates issues like trade agreements and the movement of people."

Those newspaper headlines are reflecting that.""Asked by Andrew Marr if there was a danger of ""disturbance in the streets and so on"" if Parliament thwarted Brexit, Mr Farage replied: ""Yes, I think that's right.""He added: ""The temperature of this is very, very high.""Now, I'm going to say to everybody watching this who was on the Brexit side - let's try and get even, let's have peaceful protests and let's make sure in any form of election we don't support people who want to overturn this process.""Also appearing on Andrew Marr, investment manager Gina Miller, who brought the High Court case against the government, insisted the UK had a representative democracy which ensured politicians had to debate issues.""Do we want a country where we have no process?"" she asked, adding: ""The case is that [Mrs May] cannot use something called the Royal Prerogative to do it because we do not live in a tin-pot dictatorship.""She told Mr Farage: ""That's what you argued for the whole way through [the Brexit referendum campaign] - parliamentary sovereignty.""He replied: ""No, no. This is not about whether Parliament is sovereign; it's about whether the British people are sovereign.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron criticised Mr Farage over his warnings of disturbances, saying ""all responsible politicians"" must distance themselves from UKIP's leader.He said: ""This is the politics of the gutter. All that has happened is that British judges in a British court have interpreted British laws.""Nigel Farage should welcome that. British citizens aren't talking about taking to the street, only Nigel Farage is.""Responsible leaders have a duty to calm tempers, heal division and work together to keep Britain open, tolerant and united.""Meanwhile, Mr Farage told Andrew Neil he was ""sick"" of and ""finished"" with party politics but would continue campaigning on ""issues"" after leaving frontline politics.Several contenders have quit the leadership contest, leaving Suzanne Evans, Paul Nuttall and John Rees-Evans.Mr Farage described the situation as a ""soap opera"" over a ""terrible few weeks"", but said the party was still well-placed in the opinion polls."
2016-11-06,"Scrap state pension triple-lock, say MPs",https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37871681,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe ""triple-lock"" on state pensions - which has protected the incomes of the older generation since 2010 - should be scrapped, a committee of MPs has said.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.The Work and Pensions Committee said continuing with it was ""unsustainable"" and ""unfair"" on younger families.The government said it was committed to the triple-lock until 2020 at least.Historically, pensions were linked to inflation rather than earnings, which reduced pensioner incomes relative to those of the working population.As a result of triple-lock policy, the state pension has risen by a relatively generous £1,100 since 2010, with an increase of 2.9% in April this year.However, MPs said that while pensioners had done well out of the triple-lock, young people and working-age families had suffered unfairly.So-called Millennials, born between 1981 and 2000, face being the first generation in modern times to be financially worse off than their predecessors, they added.MPs said the rising cost of the state pension - £98bn in the last tax year - was now unsustainable.Instead of the triple-lock, they say the new state pension and basic state pension could be linked simply to average earnings.They say a formula should also be included to protect pensioners during periods when earnings lag behind price inflation.In those periods, pensioners would get an above-earnings increase so that their purchasing power did not decline.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith defended the introduction of the triple-lock in 2010 because at the time pensioners were ""most likely to be in poverty"".But he told BBC Radio 5 live, this year alone the policy would cost £18bn more than was originally estimated so it was right to re-examine it.Mr Duncan Smith added: ""We still want their pension to grow, but it's the question of the rate of growth that is costing so much and that now needs to be reviewed.""The report said there was a ""trade-off"" between increasing the amount of state pension that people get and setting the age at which people receive it. Simply increasing the state pension age risked further disadvantaging people who may already be worse off and have lower life expectancies. Labour MP Frank Field, the chairman of the committee, said that at the same time as tightening their belts, young people were being asked to support a group that has ""fared relatively well in recent years"".""They've accepted that unfairness so that we could largely eliminate pensioner poverty,"" he told the BBC.""Fairness now means that the pendulum swings back in favour of working families, so they do not continue to have cuts - real cuts - in living standards, while we further advance the interests of pensioners.""A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""We want to ensure economic security for people at every stage of their life, including retirement. We are committed to the triple lock which is protecting the incomes of millions of pensioners.""Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said pensioners were ""being blamed for the problems faced by today's younger generations"".""This phoney conflict is being used as a smokescreen in order to cut back on the welfare state,"" she said.""The housing crisis hasn't been caused by pensioners but because in Britain we sold off council houses, we haven't been building enough affordable homes, wages and employment are low and insecure and an economy built on house-price inflation simply cannot be sustained. ""This is what needs to be addressed."""

The Bar Council had demanded Liz Truss respond to criticism from some MPs and newspapers over the decision that MPs should vote on triggering Article 50.The Daily Mail branded judges ""Enemies of the people""; the Daily Express said it was ""the day democracy died"".Ms Truss said the ""impartiality"" of the courts was ""respected the world over"".On Thursday, the High Court ruled Parliament should vote on when the government can trigger Article 50, beginning the formal process of the UK leaving the EU.Three judges found that the government could not start the formal process by using the royal prerogative alone, and would need the backing of both the Commons and the Lords.The government is seeking to overturn the decision at the Supreme Court - the UK's highest court of appeal - next month.Following fierce criticism of the ruling, the Bar Council of England and Wales - the professional body representing barristers called for Ms Truss to defend the judges ""as a matter of urgency"".But its chairwoman Chantal-Aimee Doerries QC said she would have expected the Lord Chancellor - who is responsible for courts, prisons, probation and constitutional affairs - to make a clearer statement on the ""unprecedented"" attack which  ""undermines the rule of law in this country"".  She said the court was entitled to rule on the case and she was ""surprised by the backlash"" because the judges were ""doing their job"".The Criminal Bar Association later passed a resolution backing the Bar Council's demands.In her statement, Ms Truss, who is also justice secretary, said: ""The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality.""In relation to the case heard in the High Court, the government has made it clear it will appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal process must be followed.""By Ben Wright, BBC News political correspondentIt could not be called a comprehensive response. Having declined all requests for an interview, the Lord Chancellor Liz Truss put out a three-line statement saying the judiciary was independent and impartial. Considering the vitriol of some press reaction to the High Court judges decision - ""enemies of the people"" according to the Daily Mail - and the demands for a defence of the judiciary from Labour and prominent Tory MPs, the government's response was the bare minimum. We know ministers are angry about the ruling and are appealing to the Supreme Court. But given a chance to say newspapers and politicians should be very wary about attacking the judiciary the Lord Chancellor demurred. Nor did she say the courts did have the jurisdiction to rule on this dispute. However, it be a very brave (or foolish?) minister to criticise the press for writing what they like about Brexit. And many voters will share the anger of some newspapers about the decision of the court. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, who had earlier said Ms Truss's silence was ""embarrassing"", called her statement ""too little, much too late"" and said she had failed to ""adequately stand up to attacks on [the] judiciary"".He said ""pressure from the legal profession, professional bodies, politicians and the public has paid off"" and Ms Truss had ""finally made at least some progress on this issue"".But he added: ""All Liz Truss has done is recite the well-known principle of the independence of the judiciary...""The last few days mean that much of the legal community now has no confidence in the Lord Chancellor to fulfil her statutory duty to protect the independence of the British judiciary.""Writing on Twitter, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the response from Ms Truss as a ""weak statement from a weak cabinet minister"".Earlier, Tory MP and former Attorney-General, Dominic Grieve, has compared coverage in one UK newspaper to the Nazi party's newspaper.He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Newspapers in a free society can do what they like.""But if you did decide to behave immoderately and whip up frenzied hatred you can do that in a free society if you set about it, and newspapers like the Daily Mail are no different from the Voelkischer Beobachter in Nazi Germany if they run headlines of that type.""Daily Mail columnist Stephen Glover defended his newspaper's stance, saying he did not believe the judges would ""feel frightened or worried"" by the criticism.He said they had made a ""decisive intervention"" in the political process, and ""must expect some comeback"".UKIP MP Douglas Carswell is among those who have attacked the judges, calling them ""politicians without accountability"".Meanwhile, Gina Miller, the investment manager and philanthropist who led the legal campaign, has said she plans to report online trolls to police after receiving rape and death threats.""I am really cross at the politicians and the media who are whipping this up because they are the ones inciting racism and violence and acrimony,"" she said.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also commented on the row, writing in a tweet: ""Horrified by trolling of judges & those going to court; British values call for honest but good disagreeing, need reconciliation not abuse"".He added independent judges were ""fundamental to our values"" and it was ""wrong to attack them for declaring the law"",Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is ""confident"" the government will win its Supreme Court appeal and is committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017."

""There are no plans beyond the hollow rhetoric, which they keep on repeating - apparently - that Brexit means Brexit.'' The Labour leader accused Prime Minister Theresa May of reaching ""secret deals"" over Brexit with companies such as Nissan, which confirmed it will build two new models at its Sunderland plant following talks with the government.""We can't have secret deals on Brexit, company by company,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""All our businesses need the kind of assurances that apparently Nissan has had about the shape of the government's Brexit plans to make the right investment decisions.""Mr Corbyn said that after ""six wasted years of austerity and savage cuts"", the Conservatives have started to change their rhetoric towards giving more help to ordinary working-class families. This month's Autumn Statement from the Chancellor Philip Hammond would be ""the test of whether they could back up their rhetoric with meaningful change"", he added.Labour has promised £500bn in investment over a decade in infrastructure improvements to railways, housing, energy and broadband, he said.""A country that doesn't invest is a country that has given up, that has taken the path of managed decline,"" he told delegates.""We offer a different way forward that meets the needs and aspirations of our people in 2016, not a 1980s - or even 1950s - never-never land.""The party leader said a Labour government would also hit out at tax dodging.""This is the message to the tax dodgers - a Labour government will come after you. No more turning a blind eye, no more shabby deals - we will collect the taxes,"" he said.The government has said MPs will get a say over any final deal relating to Brexit.But it is challenging the High Court ruling that states Parliament has the right to vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU.

On Thursday, three High Court judges ruled the government cannot officially notify the EU of its intention to leave, thus beginning formal talks, without Parliament's support.In a series of phone calls, the prime minister told European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Germany's Angela Merkel that the government believed it would win its Supreme Court appeal against the ruling and she was committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017.Although Mr Phillips represents a safe Conservative seat, his surprise departure increases the pressure on Mrs May's government - which has a working majority of 17.It is not yet clear whether Mr Phillips, who won the seat last year with a majority of more than 24,000, will stand as an independent in a future by-election although this is thought to be unlikely. by Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondentThe government's values were no longer his values. On child refugees, on the use of aid money, on the handling of Brexit, he dissented from a party he thought was heading inexorably to the right.That is the view from sources close to Stephen Phillips. One said he twice rejected a meeting with the prime minister. Will other Tories follow? Some on the party's left tell me they'd rather stay and fight. Others reflect ruefully that unlike him they have no well-paid alternative career as a barrister.A by-election in a safe seat won't much trouble party bosses. But while Downing Street doesn't want one, the departure of - yet another - Tory MP means the voices calling for a swift general election will grow a little louder.The politician, who is a barrister and part-time Crown Court judge, is the second Conservative MP to stand down in as many weeks - Zac Goldsmith last week forced a by-election over his opposition to expanding Heathrow airport. Sources say Mr Phillips informed party whips earlier this week that he would resign as an MP because he felt his values were not the values of the government.He has been critical of the government's approach to Brexit since June's Leave vote, accusing Theresa May of trying to ""ignore the views"" of Parliament and avoiding scrutiny of the government's negotiating position.In a recent newspaper article, he suggested the government was ""lurching to the right"" and that its attempt to start negotiations with the EU without the explicit approval of Parliament was ""divisive and plain wrong"". In a statement, he did not spell out the specific reasons for his resignation but said: ""It has become clear to me over the last few months that my growing and very significant policy differences with the current government mean that I am unable properly to represent the people who elected me"".However, in a letter to his constituency chairman, Mr Phillips attacked the government for ""shirking"" responsibility for unaccompanied child refugees and changes in the way international aid is spent.Mr Phillips said: ""Some will label me a quitter or, no doubt, worse. Those are labels with which I can live. The label Conservative no longer is.""In last year's election, Mr Phillips won a majority of 24,115, with 56% of the vote. Labour finished second, closely followed by UKIP. Labour said the impending by-election would be ""more about Tory failure and in-fighting than what is in the best interests of the country"".""It's clear that even Theresa May's own MPs realise that she has failed to lay out a convincing plan to deliver for Britain,"" said national campaign co-ordinator Jon Trickett.UKIP leadership contender Suzanne Evans has said she would like to be considered to be the party's candidate in the by-election.Asked about the resignation during a visit to Berlin, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested it was part of the prevailing ""sturm und drang"" (storm and stress) over Brexit - a reference to the movement of 18th Century German writers who gave free expression to emotions and ideas which sought to break with tradition. He told reporters he did not believe that the legal battle over Parliament's role would ""interfere"" with the UK's Brexit timetable - insisting that the High Court ruling was ""one stage"" in the legal process and the British people had made their views clear.Mrs May has also been seeking to reassure EU leaders about the UK's commitment to Brexit following Thursday's legal setback.No 10 said she had explained the government was ""disappointed"" by the ruling but felt it ""had strong legal arguments ahead of the case moving to the Supreme Court"".The European Commission said the timetable for beginning talks was in the UK's hands.""The president explicitly said the legal order and the constitutional order of the UK will be respected and we won't speculate on a possible delay,"" a spokeswoman said.The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.The EU's other 27 member states have said negotiations about the terms of the UK's exit - due to last two years - cannot begin until Article 50 has been invoked."
2016-11-06,PM 'confident' over Brexit case appeal,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37868987,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May has said she is ""confident"" that the government will win its appeal against a High Court ruling on triggering Brexit talks.She told European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Germany's Angela Merkel she was committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017.Three judges ruled that she cannot do so without Parliament's support.It comes as a Conservative MP said he was quitting due to ""irreconcilable"" differences with the government.Stephen Phillips has been among Tory MPs pushing for Parliament to be consulted over the UK's strategy for negotiating its exit from the EU, accusing ministers of trying to ""ignore their views"". The government is appealing against Thursday's ruling to the Supreme Court - all 11 judges are due to hear the case in early December.If it loses its appeal, it is expected that the government will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on. The prime minister's spokesman said she had expressed ""disappointment"" at Thursday's court ruling in a phone call to Mr Juncker and Mrs Merkel but had said ""the focus of the government is on the Supreme Court case. We are confident of winning that case and proceeding with Article 50"".But former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg - now the Lib Dems' Europe spokesman - said his party would seek to join with others ""in both the Commons and the Lords to amend the legislation"" to tell the government to pursue a ""soft Brexit"" that would keep the UK within the EU's single market. ""If they believe the government is pursuing an unnecessarily hard, in other words an unnecessarily self-harming version of Brexit, then of course MPs should be free to reject that,"" he told the BBC. Conservative peer Lady Wheatcroft told BBC Radio 4's Today she was willing to table an amendment to future legislation to delay the Brexit process, saying it was ""only right to delay triggering Article 50 until we have a clearer idea of what it actually entails"".But former Conservative cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told the programme: ""Frankly I think it would be a constitutional outrage if unelected Liberal Democrat peers were to stand in the way of implementing the clear result of a referendum in which 33 million people took part."" On Friday, German foreign minister Walter Steinmeier reiterated the German government's desire to see Article 50 triggered quickly at a Berlin press conference with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, ruling out any ""preliminary discussions"" before then.Boris Johnson's opening quip that (unlike his wife) he is not a Berliner did little to improve a rather frosty joint press conference after his first official bilateral meeting with his German counterpart Frank Walter Steinmeier.It is Mr Johnson's first visit as foreign secretary to Berlin, where he's widely regarded - in some cases with contempt - as being directly responsible for Britain's decision to leave the EU.This wasn't the outcome the German government hoped for. But now the decision's made they'd rather Britain just got on with it. Mr Steinmeier - who looked unimpressed by Mr Johnson's assertion that Brexit represented an opportunity - emphasised the need for the British government to trigger Article 50 as soon as possible. His priority, he added, was to the remaining 27 member states. Thursday's High Court ruling found that the government could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty alone, without the backing of Parliament - which would require publishing legislation to be debated by the Commons and the Lords.It was met with furious newspaper headlines, with the Daily Mail describing the judges involved as ""enemies of the people"" - which in turn sparked a social media backlash. Chantal-Aimee Doerries QC, chairman of the Bar Council, told BBC News the ""attack on judges"" and their role was ""extremely concerning"": ""The rule of law sits in our democracy as a cornerstone and it is important for our judiciary to rule on questions of the rule of law. If we do not respect the independent judiciary in that role we put at risk our democracy.""Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon called on Justice Secretary Liz Truss to speak out against the ""hysterical headlines"" while Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the Guardian the attacks on the judiciary were ""entirely unjustified"".But UKIP leadership contender Suzanne Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics: ""Judges are allowing pressure groups and campaigners to bring cases for judicial review and making rulings which would not stand up to scrutiny at the ballot box.""The government's appeal is expected to be heard in early December by the full Supreme Court for the first time in its history.The judgement may not be handed down until January.If the appeal fails, it is thought the government will then have to bring forward legislation - which would have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament.The bill could be subject to amendments. MPs and peers may push for more details of the government's negotiating strategy or possibly for a second referendum.The government wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017 so any legislation would need to be approved by then if the timetable is not to be pushed back.The government has argued that it cannot ""show its hand in detail"" ahead of negotiations with 27 other EU member states, despite calls from MPs to clarify her plans.For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that while she thought ""that in the end Parliament will vote for Article 50 to be triggered"" the judgement meant the government would have to give MPs ""some basic terms on which they are going to negotiate Brexit"".

2016-11-06,US sports anchor abused in Brexit mix-up,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37869797,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA US sports presenter has been flooded with online abuse after being mistaken for Brexit campaigner Gina Miller.Texas-based namesake Gina Miller was initially bemused to be branded a traitor who had ""ruined our democracy"".She said she received several hundreds of messages, including death threats, adding: ""It was absolutely vitriolic"".It came after the High Court ruled that Theresa May must seek Parliamentary approval before invoking Article 50 to start formal EU exit negotiations.London's Gina Miller, an investment manager and philanthropist, was the lead claimant in the case and was widely photographed and quoted in media coverage of the decision.Brexit court case: Who is Gina Miller?The US-based Ms Miller said she first became aware of the London investment manager's legal moves in October, after a few people mixed up the two women's Twitter addresses. But she said Thursday's ""crazy"" Brexit backlash took her completely by surprise.""On Twitter, on Facebook - there were some f-bombs, lots of people saying I was a traitor. 'You're ruining our democracy', 'F-off and move to France' - and much more'.She added: ""I even had an email. In the subject box it said: 'I hope you die, I sincerely hope you get cancer and die'.""Having visited the UK on previous occasions, Ms Miller said: ""It was in overwhelming contrast to the very proper, polite British behaviour I'd seen before.""  The London-based Ms Miller, 51, who was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain, has not answered those critics who have targeted her on social media. But speaking outside the High Court on Thursday, she said she was aware of being called a ""black widow spider"" and had suffered abuse from those in favour of leaving the EU.She said: ""That nickname is wrong on so many levels. But I do not and will not let other people bring me down. I believe that level of abuse means I am doing something right for investors.""She did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.The American Gina Miller, who is also a multi-media consultant with Smith Geiger, a market research and strategy group, said: ""If I were counselling her, I'd suggest she be a little bit more overt [on social media]. ""You have to expect some sort of reaction - and it's better to take ownership of it.""One of the legal groups that brought the case to the High Court, Mishcon de Reya, previously said that a number of other clients who wanted to join the action withdrew their names after receiving letters of abuse.Yet for US-based Ms Miller, the abuse has introduced her to a whole new fanbase - boosting her number of followers on Twitter to 28,000 - who can now keep up with her daily insights on American football and baseball.To make it clear, she did tweet: ""Again, to my new UK-friends: Wrong Gina Miller. It's @thatginamiller you want. Appreciate all the engaging dialog though.""She later said: ""The tide began to shift when they realised I was the wrong Gina Miller - with lots of people saying they were sorry. ""I started talking to some of them about soccer - one even asked me what I thought of Queen's Park Rangers' manager."" She added: ""I'll take them, I hope they'll stay - if they want to chat about sports, I'm their girl."" "

2016-11-06,UKIP leadership: Runners and riders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37567690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUKIP is holding a fresh leadership contest after the recently-elected Diane James unexpectedly quit after 18 days in the post. Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-06,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."
2016-11-06,'Press v judges',https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37891017,"At 37,000 feet, above the roar of the engines propelling the prime minister's official RAF Voyager aircraft towards Delhi, Theresa May's verdict on the raging ""Press v judges"" dispute was heard loud and clear in the crowded cabin. ""I value the independence of the judiciary,"" she said. ""I also value the freedom of the press.""The latter was ""important to democracy"", she added.It was her first contribution since three of the country's most senior judges ruled in the High Court that Parliament should, after all, have the power to trigger the all important negotiations on Britain's exit from the European Union.The gaggle of Fleet Street correspondents and political editors perked up, and took the brief declaration as the highest possible political cover-fire for what has been some of the most ferocious criticism of senior and respected judges in recent times. The Daily Mail, for example, splashed the headline ""Enemies of the People"" across its front page - above pictures of the three presiding judges.True, no prime minister would ever offer anything other than an unqualified endorsement of press freedom if invited to do so. But Mrs May repeated the words twice. Those who were outraged by the strength of the papers' attacks, and even saw the criticism as an assault on the independence of the judiciary, will be far less pleased than the editors framing the morning editions.As for the implications of the verdict, Mrs May, speaking to journalists accompanying her on her first trade mission outside Europe, was wholly unyielding. She again said there would be an appeal to the Supreme Court. And to MPs and peers planning to use their votes in Parliaments to try to force much more detail of Britain's negotiations position -  and more willingness to compromise in sealing a deal - she was implacable.""MPs and peers should recognise there was a Parliamentary decision to give a choice to the people in a referendum. Now it's the job of the government to get on and deliver it.""Control of migration was ""an important aspect"" of the referendum vote to leave the EU. Pro-European politicians won't be astonished to hear the PM's position articulated in this way. But they will now be preparing for a trial of will and strength in Parliament, as they seek to use their leverage to force the government to compromise with EU leaders and negotiators. Opposition and pro-EU MPs want a Brexit deal which maintains the UK's participation in the EU single market as close to the current terms as possible.There'll be no Labour attempt to undo Brexit. Today, Labour's leader and deputy leader have said as much. Too many Labour supporters voted to leave. But given a chance, the Opposition will try to write all sorts of conditions into the legislation starting the Brexit talks. The Lords may well be stroppier - even to the extent of stalling Brexit if they can.Again today Mrs May told reporters she was not anticipating any early general election before the due date in 2020. The message was a snap poll figured nowhere in her plans, and would not happen. Not everyone's completely convinced. Not yet."
2016-11-06,Special relationship?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37851551,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkDonald Trump could be elected president of the United States next week. But what plans has the UK got in place for this eventuality and what could it mean for its place in the world?Picture the scene. It is 20 January 2017 and a cold wind is blowing across Washington's Capitol as Donald John Trump raises his right hand and proclaims that he will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.As he looks the chief justice in the eye, hundreds of millions of people around the world wonder what his four-year term will bring.Among them are UK civil servants and politicians, pondering - with negotiations for leaving the European Union also soon to begin - what all this means for their country.It could happen. So, how well prepared is the UK for dealing with Mr Trump, who has never previously held elected office, and how is the future looking?The UK and US share a language and much cultural heritage, but, argues Tim Oliver, a fellow in European-North American relations at the London School of Economics, the truly ""special"" quality in their relationship is the sharing of intelligence, as well as co-operation over nuclear weapons and special forces.Mr Oliver says there is a risk this could ""sour"" because of the ""degree of distrust and unease"" felt by the government towards Mr Trump, ""an erratic president who appears willing to do anything when it comes to torture, bombing, relations with authoritarian states"".Critics accuse Mr Trump of isolationism, but he describes his foreign policy stance as one of ""Americanism, not globalism"". He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.The UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?""A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,"" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. ""But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.""Before the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to ""the back of the queue"" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.His trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he ""absolutely"" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.""I could see that happening,"" says Ms Schake, ""especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  ""A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.""Mr Trump's website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.Theresa May has not offered an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".Asked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: ""I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.""The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,"" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.Tony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. More trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.The problem is, Ms Schake argues, that ""Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding"", adding: ""But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.""Personal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.""Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,"" says Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government.""Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.""I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?""Many mainstream Republicans have criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush as well as Mr McCain.We know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, would be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr Trump is a hugely famous man, with a long career in business and a career in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many ""known unknowns"", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.Another complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.Then, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with ""unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next"".""I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,"" says Ms Rutter.""If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.""

For the first time, all 11 of the court's permanent justices, including those from Northern Ireland and Scotland, are expected to preside over the case, but who are they?Supreme Court president Lord NeubergerLord Neuberger, 68, is the president of the Supreme Court, a position he has held since 2012, and is the UK's most senior judge. After studying chemistry at Oxford University he worked at the merchant bank N M Rothschild & Sons from 1970-1973 until he was called to the Bar in 1974.In 2013 he voiced fears about legal aid cuts, telling the BBC they could lead people to ""take the law into their own hands"".Lord Neuberger has also led an investigation for the Bar Council, which regulates barristers, into widening access to the profession. He has two sons and one daughter. Deputy president Lady HaleLady Hale, 71, is deputy president of the Supreme Court and in October 2009 became the first woman justice of the Supreme Court when the court was established, replacing the Law Lords.Lady Hale, who became deputy president in June 2013 and is the UK's most senior female judge, previously said she was ""disappointed"" no other woman had reached the level she had.In January 2004, she became the UK's first woman Law Lord after a varied career as an academic lawyer, law reformer and judge. In October 2013 she told the BBC: """"I am disappointed that in the 10 years since I was appointed [a Law Lord] not one among the 13 subsequent appointments to this court has been a woman.""Now things are improving in the lower ranks of the judiciary, but regrettably not yet up here.""She has one daughter and lists her hobbies in Who's Who as ""domesticity"", drama and duplicate bridge.Lord ManceLord Mance, 73, was one of an original group of nine that were appointed as justices of the Supreme Court when it was established in October 2009. He had previously been a Lord Justice of Appeal and, before that, a High Court judge.Lord Mance has one son and two daughters and his hobbies, according to Who's Who, include tennis, languages, music and walking.Lord KerrLord Kerr, 68, served as Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland from 2004 to 2009, and was the last Law Lord appointed before the creation of the Supreme Court.He was called to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1970, and to the Bar of England and Wales at Gray's Inn in 1974.Lord Kerr has two sons and lists his hobbies in Who's Who as ""trying to be (and hoping to make my family) happy"".Lord ClarkeLord Clarke, 73, spent 27 years at the bar, specialising in maritime and commercial law, undertaking a wide variety of cases in these areas. He became a Recorder in 1985, sitting in both criminal and civil courts.In 2005, he was appointed Master of the Rolls and Head of Civil Justice and in October 2009 he became a justice in the Supreme Court.He has one son and two daughters.Lord WilsonLord Wilson, 71, became a justice of the Supreme Court in May 2011 after working for most of his career in the field of family law.He argued in favour of gay marriage, telling Queen's University in Belfast that he wondered how long Northern Ireland would ""be able to hold back the tide in favour of same-sex marriages"". Speaking in 2014, he said that that to allow same-sex couples the right to marry strengthened rather than weakened marriage.Northern Ireland is the only country in the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal. He has one son and a daughter.Lord SumptionLord Sumption, 67, became a justice of the Supreme Court in January 2012,He has been described as having a ""brain the size of a planet"" and the ""cleverest man in England"".

2016-11-06,May's Delhi dilemma,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37872792,"On Sunday Theresa May will land in smoggy Delhi with a large entourage of diplomats, advisers, business people and press in tow.This is an important visit. It is the new British prime minister's first bilateral meeting outside Europe, the first step in her mission to ""forge a new global role for the UK"".  It is obvious why she has chosen India. Where better to demonstrate the world of opportunity that awaits a post-Brexit Britain?India is now the world's fastest growing large economy, with GDP growth of more than 7% a year and a 1.25 billion-strong market of increasingly wealthy consumers. There should be a lot of warm words about the two countries' long-standing ties, their special relationship and their shared values.  The Indian Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, was already talking of co-operation and future partnerships when I interviewed him on Thursday.But do not be deceived by the diplomatic dance.  Diwali, the festival of lights - India's great seasonal celebration of optimism and hope - has just finished.  It is a time of extraordinary generosity. People throw lavish parties with delicious food, plenty of drink and raucous rounds of Teen Patti - India's answer to poker.I attended a string of these in New Delhi's gracious diplomatic district. Each brought more evidence that India's Diwali generosity does not extend to trade deals with the UK or anyone else.There was the top Indian diplomat who dismissed Mrs May's visit as ""an afterthought"".  He had arrived in a sleek, black BMW. The white Hindustan Ambassadors that used to be the badge of status in India's rigid governmental hierarchy are not so prized any more.The British asked for Mrs May's visit to be brought forward from December and he told me: ""This is about politics in the UK, not about what we want.""Informal trade talks have already started, again at Britain's behest.  Under EU rules,the UK cannot do any actual deals until it leaves Europe, but with a ""hard Brexit"" - where it leaves the single market - looking a real possibility, it wants to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.""Good luck with that,"" laughed the ambassador of a major economic power as he sipped from a flute of champagne at another Diwali do. ""We've been trying to get a deal for years now, but there's not much in it for India.""India was a closed economy until the early 1990s, he explained and still has comparatively high barriers to foreign imports. Meanwhile most of the developed world has been cutting back restrictions on trade.""What's more,"" continued my new friend, ""it's doing well behind those barriers. It means they want really big concessions before they'll sign up to anything.""  The European Union had the same problem.   Peter Mandelson began free trade talks between the EU and India when he was European trade commissioner back in 2007. There have been 16 separate formal rounds of negotiations in the nine years since then, but very little progress.You only need to look at the sticking points to see why the UK is unlikely to fare any better, says Sir Thomas Harris, a former ambassador to Korea who ran the UK India Business Council for many years.  India consistently refused to lift restrictions on professional services including accounting, insurance, banking and legal services, he points out. These are some of Britain's strongest sectors and exactly the kind of businesses to which Britain wants India to open up.""For the life of me, I cannot see why the Indians would be prepared to offer concessions on services in bilateral talks with the UK which they were not prepared to offer in return for access to the EU as a whole,"" he says.And then there is the even more vexed question of immigration.During the trade talks, Europe refused India's requests for more temporary visas for professional workers.  On the face of it, Mrs May's government is unlikely to be any more forthcoming. Its policy is that the number of immigrants needs to be cut dramatically.  At the Conservative Party conference last month, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, talked about the possibility of new curbs on foreign workers and students.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has since hinted he is minded to be a little more flexible on professional workers. But it is hard to overstate how badly the government's rhetoric on immigration goes down in India.""The impression Britain is giving to countries such as India is 'we want your business but we don't want your people',"" is how a former advisor to the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, put it in an Indian newspaper.When I quoted that to a top British diplomat he squirmed in discomfort. ""The government is going to have to find a way to articulate its policy more clearly,"" was his ""diplomatic"" suggestion.Mrs May's visit to India is the first big test of whether it can do that.If Britain is to prosper, Mrs May needs to be able to show that forging strong non-EU alliances can be reconciled with her hard-line stance on immigration. She also needs to demonstrate that it is possible to do trade deals that deliver real benefits to Britain.My Diwali party circuit suggests both ambitions are going to be hard to fulfil.   "
2016-11-06,Gina Miller profile,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37861888,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkGina Miller has been the lead claimant in the legal fight to get Parliament to vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU - but who is she?Ms Miller, 51, is an investment manager and philanthropist who was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain.According to her online LinkedIn page, she attended Moira House Girls' School, in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and then went to university in London.She is reported to have previously been a model and a chambermaid, but is best known for having campaigned for transparency in investment and pension funds.She co-founded the investment firm SCM Private in 2009.She and her hedge fund manager husband, Alan, launched their True and Fair Foundation - formerly known as Miller Philanthropy - in 2009.The foundation says it supports smaller charities by providing funding and support. Charity Commission records show it spent £135,982 in 2015.Ms Miller also launched the True and Fair Campaign in 2012, which campaigns against mis-selling and hidden fund charges in the City of London's fund management industry.According to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the ""black widow spider"".Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.""Ms Miller launched the Brexit legal case along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.They argued the government could not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - starting the formal process of the UK leaving the EU - without seeking approval from Parliament.Three London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the case.Ms Miller argued that only Parliament could make a decision leading to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law.But she has stressed throughout that the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now.""On November 3, three judges ruled Parliament must vote on when the process can begin.Speaking after the verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"".  She said: ""What we're saying is, very simply, you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about getting back a sovereign Parliament and being in control but at the same time then bypass it.""Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.""This case is far more fundamental than that.  It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament. ""We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship.""She has described herself as neither a leave, not a remain campaigner.Asked whether she was ""a remainer to your boots"", she told BBC's Andrew Marr Show she had campaigned for ""remain, reform and review"" during the referendum.But she said the case was now not about the referendum result, but ""how we leave the EU"".""The elephant in the room is actually about leaving the EU, it is not about reversing leaving the EU.""The case is that she cannot use something called the royal prerogative to do it, because we do not live in a tinpot dictatorship, we live in a country that has a sovereign Parliament.""She told UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the programme that ""everyone in the country"" should be her ""biggest fan"" following the controversial court case.""This is about creating legal certainty and actually, everyone in the country should be my biggest fan because I've used my own money and a few of us we have used our own money to create legal certainty for Mrs May to move ahead.""Some newspapers have focussed on Ms Miller's private life, and her former marriage. However, she said ""everyone has a past"" and it was ""totally irrelevant"" to the importance of the case.She has also spoken about the abuse she suffered following the ruling.""I was aware there would be nastiness because anything to do with the word Brexit, people lose their minds and it's all about heart. Actually it is about your head and your heart.""She told BBC Radio 5 live she plans to report online trolls to police after receiving rape and beheading threats.She also told the Andrew Marr Show she was appalled by fierce criticism of the High Court judges who ruled on the case in the press.Ms Miller said ""that is unforgivable"", saying she is ""a nobody and they are ""the biggest brains in this country"". ""They are what make us great. """
2016-11-06,Brexit battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20161107025820/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37877128,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA High Court ruling that Parliament - not the government alone - can trigger Article 50 threatens to delay Theresa May's timetable for leaving the EU, but could it spell the end for Brexit altogether?Downing Street says it is confident that the Supreme Court will overrule the High Court and allow ministers, rather than MPs, to decide when to begin the formal process of leaving the EU.But there is no evidence that government lawyers have yet amassed new arguments that might persuade the highest court in the land that the three eminent judges reached the wrong conclusion on Thursday.So if that ruling stands, then the relevant secretary of state, David Davis - in charge of the process of exiting the EU -  has said his presumption is that an Act of Parliament would be required before triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. No 10 has said that's the 'logical conclusion' of the ruling, too.Incidentally a former Conservative leader - Iain Duncan Smith - disagrees, and believes a straightforward vote of MPs would satisfy the courts.But let's assume government ministers are right.Could the mere act of consulting largely pro-Remain MPs scupper Brexit?Well, no.Although the former chancellor Ken Clarke and the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg have told the BBC that they are prepared to vote against invoking Article 50, enough Remainers are saying they would respect the result of the referendum and vote to start the process of leaving the EU. The government would not lose this vote.More likely is delay - rather than destruction - of Brexit.But the opportunities for delay depend in part on the form any legislation would take.Some pro-Brexit politicians are urging the government to come up with a simple one-line bill triggering Article 50.The shorter and simpler the legislation, the more difficult it would be for Remainers to put forward elaborate amendments attempting to tie the government's hands in subsequent negotiations with the EU.The former attorney general Dominic Grieve reckons that amendments could still be permitted, so long as they were addressed to the narrow substance of the bill.This could allow, for example, an amendment to hold a second referendum on the final deal negotiated by the government, given that those negotiations were triggered by the Article 50 process - the option favoured by the former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith.Even assuming that all amendments were defeated or ruled out of order, any legislation at all carries a risk for the government.That's because it needs to be approved not just by the Commons but by the Lords.And many pro-Remain unelected peers might be less squeamish than MPs about voting against Article 50.If - and it's a big if - that were to happen, then the government would have to use the Parliament Acts to overrule them. Peers cannot stop legislation outright - they can simply force a rethink.That would delay the process by about a year - scuppering not Brexit itself, but Theresa May's promise to start the process by the end of March 2017.It might also extend our membership of the EU until just after the next general election, in the spring of 2020.Some pro-Brexit Conservatives are already urging the prime minister to call an early election under these circumstances, on a platform of standing up for ""the people"" against ""the peers"".With the party's lead in the polls, they calculate that this would strengthen the government's mandate.  But, given the complications and potential consequences of yesterday's ruling, you can understand why minsters are keeping their fingers firmly crossed that the Supreme Court will overturn it."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The Supreme Court is expected to hear its appeal early next month.Speaking to BBC Business Editor Simon Jack on a trade visit to India, Mrs May said: ""I'm clear that I expect to be able to trigger Article 50 by the end of March next year. That's what I've said consistently and I continue to work on that basis.""She added: ""We believe the government has got strong legal arguments. We'll be putting those arguments to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will make its judgement."" There is some debate about whether a vote at Westminster on invoking Article 50 would require a full Act of Parliament, or whether it could happen much more speedily by MPs and peers agreeing to a resolution - a written motion - instead.Asked about this, Mrs May suggested that she would expect the court to set out which of the two options would be required.She said: ""If it were the case that the Supreme Court were to uphold the view of the High Court, then the judgement would set out what the details were.""In recent days, the idea of an early election has been raised, but Mrs May said: ""I've been clear the next general election should be in 2020. ""The government is getting on with the job in delivering what people voted for on 23 June which was for Britain to leave the European Union. We're going to put that in to practice.""  In June's UK-wide referendum, voters opted by 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of leaving the EU.Earlier on Monday, Brexit Secretary David Davis gave the government's official response to the High Court's ruling, telling MPs the referendum result ""must be respected and delivered"".He added: ""There must be no attempt to remain inside the EU now, attempting it behind the back door or a second referendum.""For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to have a vote on the issue, as it was ""sovereign"" and, because of this, ""that scrutiny matters"". However, his party would not ""frustrate"" the process of invoking Article 50, he added.He told MPs the government's approach was ""unravelling"" in an ""ugly way"", adding: ""We saw a series of appalling personal attacks on the judges, including the suggestion that they were 'enemies of the people'."" This was a reference to a headline used in the Daily Mail on Friday - the day after the High Court's decision.Mr Davis insisted that ""we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary"", but defended the freedom of the press. ""Both these things underpin our democracy,"" he said.Suzanne Evans, one of the three candidates for the UKIP leadership contest, told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme that judges could be ""subject to some kind of democratic control"" following the High Court's decision.She did not want to undermine ""their judicial independence"", but added: ""I suppose that in this case, we have had a situation where we have judges committed to stay in the European Union...""I'm questioning the legitimacy of this particular case. We know that the legal profession threw a collective hissy fit when we voted to leave.""Scotland's Brexit minister, the SNP's Michael Russell, said he could not imagine any circumstances in which his party's MPs would vote in favour of triggering Article 50."

MPs gave notice only this morning that they would visit the Derbyshire site.The committee has investigated working practices at Shirebrook, and wanted to see if improvements had been made.After a three hour tour, they gathered in a private room when they said a recording device was found.The company had been expecting a visit from MPs, but was not told when the spot check would be. One of the six, Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, said: ""At the end of the meeting, we sat down to have a private conversation in a room by ourselves.""A lady came in with some sandwiches, which was very kind. I saw her take too long to do it, she put it down and I saw her put a recording device on the floor.""She left the room and I went over to pick up the device and there it was: a camera and a recording device for the conversation that we were having privately.""I'm very disappointed."" A spokesman for Sports Direct declined to comment.The committee chairman, Iain Wright said he spoke to Sports Direct's chief executive, Mike Ashley, on the phone after the MPs left the warehouse.He said: ""I don't think it was a particularly pleasant conversation for either of us.""I want to work with Mike Ashley in a constructive manner. I don't think he wants to work with us at all any more.""The company, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under the spotlight after a BBC investigation uncovered a culture of unorthodox and illegal working practices at the warehouse.Among issued raised were staff being kept on site at Shirebrook after their shifts for body searches, putting them below the legal minimum wage.Concern about working conditions led to Sports Direct's founder Mike Ashley being called to appear in front of the Business and Skills Committee. He admitted at the hearing that control of the company had slipped beyond him. Mr Ashley denied knowing about the day-to-day operation at Shirebrook.Sports Direct has promised a number of changes since Mr Ashley's appearance at the committee. Mr Ashley is thought to be on holiday and was not at Shirebrook during the visit."

Two UN committee members visited London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast in October 2015 to identify any gaps in human rights protection for disabled people.  As part of its inquiry, the CRPD also looked at a range of recent welfare reforms and legislation including the Welfare Reform Act 2012, Care Act 2014, and Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016.The inquiry concluded that changes to housing benefits and criteria for parts of the Personal Independence Payment, along with a narrowing of social care criteria and the closure of the Independent Living Fund, all ""hindered disabled people's right to live independently and be included in the community"".Other findings:The inquiry also said welfare assessors displayed a ""lack of awareness and limited knowledge of disability rights and specific needs"", and disabled people experienced ""anxiety and psychological strain"" due to uncertainty about assessment results.""The committee observes that measures have caused financial hardship to persons with disabilities resulting in... arrears, debts, evictions and cuts to essentials such as housing and food,"" the report said.The committee made 11 recommendations to the UK government, including calling for a complete impact assessment of reforms introduced since 2010, and introducing measures to fight ""negative and discriminatory stereotypes"".However, Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green rejected the report's findings and said the document demonstrated ""an outdated view of disability which is patronising and offensive"".""The UN measures success as the amount of money poured into the system, rather than the work and health outcomes for disabled people,"" he said.""The UK is a recognised world leader in disabled rights and equality. Not only do we spend about £50bn a year to support sick and disabled people, but we also offer a wide range of tailored and effective support, which this report fails to recognise.""He added: ""Our work and health Green Paper marks a turning point in our action to confront the attitudes, prejudices and misunderstandings within the minds of employers and across wider society.""Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said: ""The UN report confirms that, despite Theresa May's warm words, this government is failing sick and disabled people."""
2016-11-07,Brexit appeal could 'undermine justice',https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37904160,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe justice system could be undermined if a ruling that only Parliament can trigger Brexit is overturned, a former lord chief justice has said.Lord Judge said it would be seen as a victory for pro-Brexit demonstrators should the Supreme Court reverse last week's controversial High Court ruling.The government, he told BBC Newsnight, had been too slow to defend judges following press attacks over the case.Ministers say they support judicial independence but also a free press.In a Commons statement on Monday, Brexit Secretary David Davis said it was ""perfectly proper"" for people to respect the integrity of the judicial process while disagreeing with individual judgements.He condemned what he said were ""deplorable"" attacks on social media on Gina Miller, the woman who instigated the legal challenge against the government, but also defended a free press which he said was as much a guarantor of democracy as judicial independence.  The government is appealing against Thursday's ruling that Parliament must give its consent before the UK can officially notify the EU of its intention to leave by triggering Article 50 - which Theresa May has said she wants to do by the end of March.The case is expected to be heard next month although the verdict might not come until early next year, raising doubts about the PM's ability to meet her stated timetable to begin negotiations on the UK's exit.Amid anger over the High Court ruling, which led the Daily Mail to label three of the most senior judges in England and Wales ""enemies of the people"", UKIP leader Nigel Farage has vowed to lead peaceful protests outside the Supreme Court in the run-up to the hearing.The Daily Express has claimed 100,000 people could join a march in Westminster on the first day of the Supreme Court hearing. Lord Judge, who was the most senior judge in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013 and who is now a crossbench peer, told BBC Newsnight that people were entitled to protest but he was concerned about the impact the case might have on the legal system.""People can march as much as they like,"" he said.""I don't think it makes any difference to the judicial decision but it does make a difference to public order.""Let's say for the sake of argument the Supreme Court decides the High Court was wrong, it will undoubtedly be conveyed as a victory for the demonstrators.""It won't be but that's what will be conveyed. And if that is conveyed, you've undermined the administration of justice.""Lord Judge said the judges who delivered last week's ruling, including his successor as lord chief justice Lord Thomas, carried out their duty and ""happened to decide that Parliament was sovereign"". He said Lord Chancellor Liz Truss had ""a statutory obligation"" to defend the judiciary in the face of what he said had been highly personal attacks on their integrity, but he had been disappointed by her response.""That is one of her functions, to defend the judiciary. And it was a little too late and not a lot. ""To say you believe in independence of judges is fine but it doesn't actually address why this matters at a particular time.""A number of Conservative MPs have said ministers could have spoken out earlier and more vehemently, with former Attorney General Dominic Grieve saying the response was ""muted"".But ex-Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the freedom of the press was ""also a precious thing"" and while the judgement ""deserved respect"", the democratic mandate arising from the 23 June vote - in which 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU - must also be heeded. A government spokesman said the Lord Chancellor was ""very clear her role is to protect the independence of the judiciary not to police the press"". The government has said it will not decide what to do until the Supreme Court reaches its judgement, with ministers said to be weighing up whether to seek authorisation to begin official Brexit talks through new legislation or through a one-off parliamentary resolution.Lord Judge said he would vote to trigger Article 50 when the matter came before the Lords.""I think the result of the referendum means that the wishes of the majority of the people have to be respected,"" he said.Former Chancellor Ken Clarke has called on the government to stop ""faffing around"", saying it could table a vote in the Commons on a simple motion before the Supreme Court hearing.Speaking at an event in Westminster, the veteran Europhile said he personally would vote against Article 50 but that it would comfortably be passed by the Commons."

Mr Hammond has already said he will prioritise spending on new homes and transport rather than following his predecessor George Osborne's aim to balance the books by 2020.The IFS said he now had ""two big decisions"" to make; one on whether he should increase spending or cut taxes to boost the economy and the second on what new fiscal targets he should announce.Mr Pope said given uncertainty over the economic outlook, Mr Hammond ""might be wise to respond cautiously for now"".""Any new fiscal targets should be reasonably flexible,"" he said.Several groups have reduced their UK growth forecasts and raised their inflation forecasts since the EU referendum.Last month, The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for 2017 UK economic growth to 1.1% as it warned that the global recovery remains ""weak and precarious"".International body the OECD also cut its forecast for next year from 2% to 1%, saying: ""Uncertainty about the future path of policy and the reaction of the economy remains very high and risks remain to the downside.""Last week, the Bank of England upgraded its growth forecasts for this year and next, but cut expectations for 2018 to 1.5% from 1.8%."

In a joint plea to ministers, the Nuffield Trust, King's Fund and Health Foundation said the sector was facing a major funding shortage.The think tanks said cuts were so deep, councils may no longer be meeting their duties to the elderly and disabled.The government says it is investing in the care system with £5bn set aside for the NHS to work with the care system.An additional £1.5bn is being added to that by 2019, while councils have been allowed to increase council tax by 2% a year to invest in care services.The latest warning about care services comes ahead of Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement later this month on government spending.Councils are complaining they have not been given enough cash. and last month, the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, said council care cuts were one of the major factors behind the growing demands on A&E units.The three think tanks, which are making a joint submission to ministers ahead of that announcement, highlighted figures showing how councils had started reducing the amount of support they provided to older people.Richard Humphries, from the King's Fund, said it was clear councils were struggling to meet their statutory duties under the Care Act, including promoting well-being and providing high quality care to elderly and disabled people.He said while he was not aware of any legal action yet, he pointed to rising numbers of complaints about care being made to the the Local Government Ombudsman and a rise in the number being upheld as a sign that could change.""That shows that councils are struggling. It is a warning sign. We could start seeing people taking legal action,"" he added.You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.

2016-11-07,Surrey heads protest to PM over grammars,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-37898977,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEvery head teacher of a state secondary school in Surrey has signed a letter to the prime minister expressing their ""vehement opposition"" to plans for more grammar schools in England.The heads say this ""unprecedented"" coalition reflects the ""confusion"" caused by plans to increase selection.They say 95% of pupils in Surrey are already at good or outstanding schools.The government says that providing more grammar school places would give extra opportunities for poorer pupils.The letter sent to Theresa May and Education Secretary Justine Greening says that heads in Surrey are strongly opposed to creating a ""selective, segregated, two-tier state funded system of education"".In a hard-hitting letter, they accuse ministers of creating ""confusion and fragmentation"" in England's school system, with a policy based on a ""nostalgic and unrealistic vision of society"".The heads have told the prime minister that the current comprehensive system delivers high standards and that this will be put at risk by the return of a grammar system and selection by ability.""It is impossible to have grammar schools without secondary modern schools or their equivalent,"" says the joint letter from head teachers.The head teachers say that poorer pupils are under-represented in grammars and that there is no evidence of any positive impact on social mobility.They also call on the prime minister to focus on real problems facing schools, which they say are ""continuing funding cuts, an unassuaged and escalating recruitment crisis"".This is the latest example of head teachers exerting their collective influence - apart from the lobbying of their unions.Every state school head teacher in West Sussex signed a joint letter to the prime minister warning that they could have to cut school hours because of a lack of funding.The House of Commons education select committee will be carrying out an ""evidence check"" on Tuesday on plans to expand selection.Committee chair, Neil Carmichael, said that since the plans for more grammars had been announced ""the air has been thick with the sound of claims and counter-claims on the benefits and disadvantages of grammar schools"".He said that it would be important for MPs to ""get underneath the rhetoric and examine the evidence"".The consultation on expanding selection will continue until next month.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Grammar schools have a track record of closing the attainment gap between children on free school meals and their better-off classmates and 99% of grammar schools are rated good or outstanding. ""We want all children, whatever their background, to have access to an education that will unlock their talents. That's why we will scrap the ban on new grammar schools and make more good school places available, to more parents, in more parts of the country."""

But Sir Michael said it would deliver better value for money and release enough land to build 55,000 homes.It is estimated that about £140m will be saved over the next decade by selling off the sites, which Sir Michael said would be reinvested in creating ""areas of military expertise"" in locations across the country.More than 32,000 acres of defence land will be released, including 10 surplus airfields and five golf courses. ""By putting money where it is needed, we will provide better facilities to train our armed forces and deliver more stability for military families,"" he said, adding that the moves are part of a package of more than £4bn of investment in the services.The majority of sites will be in England, including parts of Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire - the Army's largest garrison - the Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, near Grantham, and Imphal Barracks in York. A further eight sites in Scotland will close, including the Redford Calvary and Infantry Baracks in Edinburgh, and Fort George, near Ardersier.Then Wales and Northern Ireland will each have three bases closed, including Brecon Barracks.New sites and bases will be moved to locations which are selected based on employment opportunities in the community, enabling military families to buy their own homes and reducing disruption to children's education, Sir Michael said.These include new regional hubs for light infantry battalions in London, Edinburgh, Lisburn, St Athan, Blackpool and Cottesmore, as well as air assault forces in Colchester and a specialised infantry group in Aldershot.Nia Griffith, shadow defence secretary, said Labour recognised there was ""a need to modernise"" the defence estate, but wanted reassurance families would be taken care of. She said: ""The government is right to seek to restructure the estate to ensure that we optimise our military capability and deliver value for money for the British taxpayer.""The changes proposed in this report are very considerable in scale and there is a real need to ensure they are delivered in a way that does not cause undue challenges to our forces and their families.""Ms Griffith also asked Sir Michael to confirm that all of the money raised would go back into defence and not into the Treasury. In reply, he said: ""All of the receipts, not some of them but all of the receipts, will come back in to the defence budget.""But unions have said the cuts will severely hit the support for armed forces and damage morale. Mark Serwotka, general secretary for the Public and Commercial Services union, said: ""We are opposed to these closure plans that throw the future into doubt for thousands of staff. ""The MoD has a poor track record on selling off land for homes and this again exposes how the Tories are simply paying lip service to the urgent need to address the housing crisis.""Mike McCartney, national officer for Unite, echoed the criticism, calling the closures ""brutal"".""In many instances the bases earmarked for closure are at the heart of their local communities providing a source of decent and secure employment,"" he said.91MoD sites to be sold£4bnto be spent refurbishing bases 32,500 acres of defence land to be released £140m savings in reduced running costs over 10 years 55,000 new homes will be built on the land "

Where better to get a taste of life beyond the EU - than India. With such deep historical links between the two countries - surely the UK can cut through the bureaucratic smog that saw Brussels spend nearly a decade negotiating, but ultimately fail to agree a deal with the world's fastest growing economy. But Indian business leaders are confused. No-one knows what the UK's relationship with Europe will eventually look like, and many are unsure about how much can be usefully discussed until the UK has withdrawn from the EU - a point that is at least two years away. Some things are clear and all too familiar. Trade and immigration are linked. If the UK wants better access to Indian markets, the government in Delhi wants a looser approach to UK work and student visas. This week saw Britain's visa rules for foreign visitors tightened. Specific deals will be announced over the next 24 hours but more clarity around a trade relationship that has stagnated or even declined in recent years is likely to remain enveloped in the Delhi smog. Visa issues risk dominating Theresa May's first trade trip since becoming prime minister.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a technology summit in Delhi he wanted to encourage ""greater mobility"" for its young people in education. He said: ""Education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. ""We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.""Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria earlier said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years.He said ""movement of people"" would form a key part of any trade negotiations.The number of study visas issued to Indian nationals fell from 68,238 in the year to June 2010 to 11,864 five years later, official UK figures show.The solution, according to Karan Bilimoria, is to exclude foreign students from Britain's statistics on net migration, which Mrs May has pledged to cut to below 100,000 annually - down from 336,000 in the year to June 2015.""We need to immediately get the government, Theresa May, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures,'"" crossbencher Lord Bilimoria told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.He added: ""The reality is Theresa May when she was home secretary did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration.""""She has got a lot of bridge-building to do when she goes to India.""Mrs May will be accompanied on the three-day trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and trade minister Greg Hands as well as representatives from 33 UK companies.Deals expected to be confirmed during the trip include:"

I also value the freedom of our press. I think these both underpin our democracy and they are important. ""Of course the judges will look at the legal arguments. We think we have strong legal arguments and we will be taking those arguments to the Supreme Court.""UKIP's interim leader, Nigel Farage, warned of large-scale public protests if Parliament delays or blocks the invoking of Article 50 , caused by ""political anger, the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed"".Ms Evans told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were likely to be ""protests and demonstrations"", but added that these would be peaceful.She added: ""I have a concern that Article 50 is not intended to facilitate nation states leaving the European Union. I think it's there to frustrate them.""Ms Evans said she thought the legal process could ""water down Brexit"".She added: ""I think it's amusing that the very same people who say it's all about parliamentary sovereignty have, for the last 48 years, been trying to undermine parliamentary sovereignty"".Ms Evans said: ""I think there's a debate to be had about whether or not judges are subject to some kind of democratic control.""She did not want to undermine ""their judicial independence"", but added: ""I suppose that in this case, we have had a situation where we have judges committed to stay in the European Union...""I'm questioning the legitimacy of this particular case. We know that the legal profession threw a collective hissy fit when we voted to leave.""Ms Evans said it was ""human"" to have ""opinions"", adding: ""I'm not saying that we should get rid of judges.""The government insists the High Court's decision will not affect its timetable for triggering Article 50 by the end of next March. And Labour has said it will not vote to delay the triggering of Article 50.However, the SNP's Brexit Minister Mike Russell told the BBC he ""can't imagine"" any circumstances in which his party's 54 MPs would vote to trigger it.UKIP will announce its new leader on 28 November, with Paul Nuttall and John Rees-Evans the rival candidates to Ms Evans.

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "

Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."
2016-11-07,Friendly smiles,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37896976,"If Theresa May was seeking to ramp up UK-India trade in smiles, salutes and friendly rhetoric, she'd have a world class deal already.The prime minister shared a long lunch, a long chat and two public platforms with her Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in New Delhi and she's sure to spend more time in future cultivating a personal and economic relationship she sees as vital to British prosperity after Brexit.But sealing a comprehensive trade deal demands more than smiles and salutes.India wants more visas for students and workers. Theresa May has shown no inclination to offer any broad commitment to a more liberal approach to Indian migration.There is no cap on visa numbers. The official UK line is Britain's doors are open to the ""brightest and the best"". Yet the UK is widely seen in India as wanting ""free trade in everything except people"".And Mrs May's anxiety to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is well-known and frequently stated.Today the prime minister promised to allow Indian travellers, maybe 10,000 over the coming two years, to pass UK immigration more easily at ports and airports - as easily as UK travellers. Successful high value travellers, of the kind most countries are keen to welcome, would have extra help and advice for their families and themselves.However, Mrs May also wants India to do more to facilitate the return of Indians who have overstayed their legal limit in the UK. That might mean more effort approving the documentation needed to return an overstayer home.Again, the British desire to bear down on net migration lies at the root of a tension in relations between the two countries.If Britain is going to make a success of Brexit in the broadest sense, it is vital to cultivate India, a trade market which has shrunk even as the Indian economy has grown. The political obstacles at home on the road to Brexit have yet to be negotiated. The challenges beyond already look daunting.Swashbuckling, dashing, gloriously reckless. Just a few of the epithets you'll never, ever, see applied to Theresa May. Yet it's hard to think of anyone who's had a more successful few months in today's politics. If she was a cricketer, she'd be Geoffrey Boycott.And if the Yorkshire and England cricket legend was here in New Delhi, he'd probably sing her praises. Which, as it happens, he is and he did.""She'll be like Margaret Thatcher,"" he told an admiring gaggle of cricket-loving journos who spotted him the the Taj Palace Hotel.""She's good. She doesn't need my advice. She's got a few more strokes than me.""""She has views and she's strong. Life is about integrity and principles - it should be. We want politicians like that with integrity, with principles, with honesty.""As any Test Match Special listener could tell you, when Geoffrey likes someone, he says so. And generally doesn't stop.

2016-11-07,Time to talk,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37845980,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkWhen proposing new laws, ministers can fill the statute books from the relative safety of their positions in government. But for the average backbench MP, the chance to make laws can seem a distant possibility.Their best chance comes around once a year, in the form of a random ballot.The prize? A chance for MPs to promote their pet project in the House of Commons by introducing it as a Private Members' Bill.Private Members' Bills can be introduced in three different ways. The first are ""Ten Minute Rule"" bills, where MPs make a speech of no more than 10 minutes to outline their position. Second are presentations to the Commons, where an MP might formally introduce the title of their bill.The third and most likely to make it onto the statute book are the ""Ballot Bills"", so-called because MPs take part in a random draw to decide who gets to propose a bill in the Commons. The system has its critics, among them the SNP MP who sponsored the ""Turing Bill"" to pardon gay men for obsolete sexual offences.""It is absurd for legislation to be decided by the deputy speaker pulling balls out of a jar. It seems altogether too random,"" John Nicolson says.If this sounds confusing, it's probably because it is.In a report on Private Members' Bills, the Commons' Procedure Committee called the process ""impenetrable"" and ""enormously damaging to the reputation of the House and to the legislative process"".Chairman of the committee, Broxbourne MP Charles Walker, says: ""One thing you have to do in this house is accept failure, but you need to have a fair crack at failure, and I don't think most backbenchers now have a fair crack at failure.""Even if an MP is lucky enough to propose their Private Members' Bill to the Commons, it is far from guaranteed that it will become law. Opposing MPs can stop these sorts of bills progressing by ""filibustering"" or ""talking them out"" during debates held on 13 Fridays throughout the year - a process the Procedure Committee report describes as ""speaking at inordinate length on the bill to ensure that the debate cannot conclude"" before the set time limit. Mr Nicolson's Private Members' Bill, the Sexual Offences (Pardons) Bill, fell after a government minister used up the time allotted for debating it by speaking for 25 minutes. There were cries of ""shame"" and ""shameful"" from some MPs as Justice Minister Sam Gyimah's speech brought the debate to a close.Speaking to the BBC Mr Nicolson said: ""I think voters consider filibustering to be wrong. And I agree with them. ""Filibustering is archaic, and often used to frustrate the Private Members' Bill process. If a minister doesn't talk out a bill, a hard core of obstructionist MPs often do it, talking nonsensically for lengthy periods until the time allocated for the bill is over."" Mr Gyimah defended his opposition to Mr Nicolson's bill, saying ""I understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson's bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences.""Conservative MP Philip Davies, a regular attendee of Friday debates on Private Members' Bills, mounted a passionate defence of talking out. Speaking to a Procedure Committee evidence session Mr Davies said: ""I support a bill by not speaking at all, and stop a bad bill from going forward by running out of time.""If the purpose of me contributing to the debate is to try to stop bills that I think are bad, this is the mechanism that I have to use, under the rules,"" he continued.""If there was another mechanism of blocking them that didn't involve me speaking in the debate, the chances are that I would use that mechanism and therefore nobody would hear another point of view. You would only hear one side.""Mr Davies concluded: ""When we have a debate, whether people like the outcome or not, at least people get to hear that there is a different opinion on a particular bill.""Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had a similar experience of a bill being talked out in 2015. Her ""NHS Reinstatement"" bill ran out of time after MPs spent four-and-a-half hours debating the two-clause Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) bill. Ms Lucas told the Procedure Committee the bill was one that ""certain MPs have 'on the shelf' for the purpose of clogging up Private Members' Bill time on Fridays"". The Brighton Pavilion MP told the BBC: ""What really turns the public off politics is witnessing the childish way some MPs speak for a huge amount of time in order to 'talk out' bills and prevent them from being concluded and voted on.""While talking out has many opponents, there are ways of clamping down on the practice that already exist.In its recommendations for changes to the Private Members' Bill process, the Procedure Committee suggested that the Speaker and his deputies overseeing debates on them should make greater use of their existing ability to impose time limits on speeches.Equally, an MP sponsoring a Private Members' Bill can attempt to close a debate before it runs out of time. The problem is that to do so 100 MPs have to be present in the chamber - a requirement the committee's report called a ""a formidable hurdle"" to overcome on Fridays, when many MPs have already returned to their constituencies. In the end, opponents of talking out may be disappointed, because the Procedure Committee stopped short of calling for a ban.Warning against applying more rules to Commons debates, the committee instead suggested limiting opportunities to indulge in the practice.""The more rules there are, the greater the opportunities to game them,"" it said."
2016-11-07,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37897476,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAs Prime Minister Theresa May leads a trade mission to India, there has been discussion about how students are treated in migration figures.Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria told BBC News: ""We need to immediately get the government, Theresa May, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures'.""Students are currently included in the official net migration figures that are estimated by the Office for National Statistics.It published a document earlier this year about the treatment of students in the statistics.The net migration figures are based on the International Passenger Survey, which asks people at UK ports whether they are planning to stay or leave for at least 12 months. Including students is standard practice. If all the international students who came to study for more than a year left again at the end of their courses then, over time, they would have no impact on net migration figures. If the way the figures are collected was perfect (which it is not - it is a survey) then they would be counted in at the start of their courses and counted out at the end of them.Removing students from the net migration figures would reduce them considerably for three or four years, but have no impact after that.But the reason that the statisticians keep students in the net migration figures is that there is a gap between the numbers arriving and the numbers leaving.In the year to the end of June 2015, 184,000 students came to the UK planning to stay for at least a year, while 57,000 students who had started courses in previous years left.The ONS said that gap had been fairly consistent since 2012, when it started collecting figures in this way.That gap makes a big difference to the net migration figures - it's a gap of 127,000 a period when total net migration to the UK was 336,000.Some of this gap could be down to the imperfections in the International Passenger Survey, which is a big survey, interviewing 700,000 to 800,000 people a year, but is still a survey and hence only an estimate. And there are particular problems with sampling students, for example, somebody doing a master's degree may say on arrival that they are planning to stay for a year but then leave after 11 months, meaning that they would be counted as a long-term migrant as they arrived but not as they left.Some of the gap will be down to people who have extended their visas or obtained new ones, having started new courses or found skilled work, for example.And there will be people who have finished their courses and outstayed their visas.To get an idea of how many people are extending their student visas, the Home Office says that in 2014, 75,000 people were granted an extension of stay in the UK to study, of whom 12,000 had previously been on non-study visas. That figure for extensions was relatively low, having averaged 127,000 over the previous three years.Lord Bilimoria said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years.It has actually fallen by more than that, with 68,238 study visas issued to Indian nationals in the year to June 2010, falling to 11,864 five years later, according to official figures.The rules have indeed been tightened, with students from outside the EU wanting to extend their study visas, for example, having to do so from outside the UK and visas no longer allowing students to seek work in the UK after graduation.Nonetheless, over that same period, the number of students coming from China to the UK rose from 39,695 to 68,294.

Writing under the headline ""Visa cloud over trade ties as British PM Theresa May arrives in India"", Jayanth Jacob of leading daily Hindustan Times said ""the stringent visa regulations by the British cast a shadow over the prospect of the two countries hammering out an ambitious trade and investment partnership post-Brexit"". Jacob quoted S Irudayarajan, migration expert and consultant for government on mobility issues, as saying that ""India is an important country for the UK. And curbing the flow of good minds whether they are students or skilled workers is not good for the UK"".Reflecting similar sentiments, The Times of India published an editorial titled ""Muddled May"". ""As the second largest global job creator in Britain and its third largest source of foreign direct investment, India finds these British policies both objectionable and puzzling. How does the UK hope to forge closer trade ties with India while growing increasingly disagreeable to Indian trade professionals?"" A UK-India free trade agreement would be a ""non-starter as long as the visa issue isn't sorted"", added the Times of India. In an opinion piece on news portal DailyO headlined: ""Post-Brexit, Britain is no lure for Indian students, and Theresa May's no help"", columnist K Srinivasan notes that ""Britain used to be the preferred destination for higher education, coupled with lucrative employment in related fields of study, for people from many countries, including India. But not any more, as the country's immigration laws get tighter and the impact of Brexit surfaces slowly"".Business daily The Economic Times in a piece headlined ""Where great minds meet"" concurs, saying: ""With the contentious issue of immigration in the background, PM May has her hands full on this visit to India, seeking a quick and favourable trade deal, while looking to project the UK as a truly global and forward looking nation."" Television channel NDTV also notes that: ""IT professionals have asked how there can be better trade, with Mrs May's government making it tougher for Indian professionals to travel to that country with tougher new rules for visa and immigration.""BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

But what plans has the UK got in place for this eventuality and what could it mean for its place in the world?Picture the scene. It is 20 January 2017 and a cold wind is blowing across Washington's Capitol as Donald John Trump raises his right hand and proclaims that he will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.As he looks the chief justice in the eye, hundreds of millions of people around the world wonder what his four-year term will bring.Among them are UK civil servants and politicians, pondering - with negotiations for leaving the European Union also soon to begin - what all this means for their country.It could happen. So, how well prepared is the UK for dealing with Mr Trump, who has never previously held elected office, and how is the future looking?The UK and US share a language and much cultural heritage, but, argues Tim Oliver, a fellow in European-North American relations at the London School of Economics, the truly ""special"" quality in their relationship is the sharing of intelligence, as well as co-operation over nuclear weapons and special forces.Mr Oliver says there is a risk this could ""sour"" because of the ""degree of distrust and unease"" felt by the government towards Mr Trump, ""an erratic president who appears willing to do anything when it comes to torture, bombing, relations with authoritarian states"".Critics accuse Mr Trump of isolationism, but he describes his foreign policy stance as one of ""Americanism, not globalism"". He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.The UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?""A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,"" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. ""But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.""Before the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to ""the back of the queue"" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.His trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he ""absolutely"" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.""I could see that happening,"" says Ms Schake, ""especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  ""A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.""Mr Trump's website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.Theresa May has not offered an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".Asked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: ""I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.""The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,"" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.Tony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. More trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.The problem is, Ms Schake argues, that ""Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding"", adding: ""But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.""Personal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.""Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,"" says Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government.""Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.""I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?""Many mainstream Republicans have criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush as well as Mr McCain.We know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, would be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr Trump is a hugely famous man, with a long career in business and a career in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many ""known unknowns"", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.Another complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.Then, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with ""unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next"".""I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,"" says Ms Rutter.""If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.""

2016-11-07,'Press v judges',https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37891017,"At 37,000 feet, above the roar of the engines propelling the prime minister's official RAF Voyager aircraft towards Delhi, Theresa May's verdict on the raging ""Press v judges"" dispute was heard loud and clear in the crowded cabin. ""I value the independence of the judiciary,"" she said. ""I also value the freedom of the press.""The latter was ""important to democracy"", she added.It was her first contribution since three of the country's most senior judges ruled in the High Court that Parliament should, after all, have the power to trigger the all important negotiations on Britain's exit from the European Union.The gaggle of Fleet Street correspondents and political editors perked up, and took the brief declaration as the highest possible political cover-fire for what has been some of the most ferocious criticism of senior and respected judges in recent times. The Daily Mail, for example, splashed the headline ""Enemies of the People"" across its front page - above pictures of the three presiding judges.True, no prime minister would ever offer anything other than an unqualified endorsement of press freedom if invited to do so. But Mrs May repeated the words twice. Those who were outraged by the strength of the papers' attacks, and even saw the criticism as an assault on the independence of the judiciary, will be far less pleased than the editors framing the morning editions.As for the implications of the verdict, Mrs May, speaking to journalists accompanying her on her first trade mission outside Europe, was wholly unyielding. She again said there would be an appeal to the Supreme Court. And to MPs and peers planning to use their votes in Parliaments to try to force much more detail of Britain's negotiations position -  and more willingness to compromise in sealing a deal - she was implacable.""MPs and peers should recognise there was a Parliamentary decision to give a choice to the people in a referendum. Now it's the job of the government to get on and deliver it.""Control of migration was ""an important aspect"" of the referendum vote to leave the EU. Pro-European politicians won't be astonished to hear the PM's position articulated in this way. But they will now be preparing for a trial of will and strength in Parliament, as they seek to use their leverage to force the government to compromise with EU leaders and negotiators. Opposition and pro-EU MPs want a Brexit deal which maintains the UK's participation in the EU single market as close to the current terms as possible.There'll be no Labour attempt to undo Brexit. Today, Labour's leader and deputy leader have said as much. Too many Labour supporters voted to leave. But given a chance, the Opposition will try to write all sorts of conditions into the legislation starting the Brexit talks. The Lords may well be stroppier - even to the extent of stalling Brexit if they can.Again today Mrs May told reporters she was not anticipating any early general election before the due date in 2020. The message was a snap poll figured nowhere in her plans, and would not happen. Not everyone's completely convinced. Not yet."

2016-11-07,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108015420/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump cast their ballots in New York polling stations, alongside their spouses.High turnout is being reported across the country with polling stations due to begin closing on the East Coast at 19:00 EST (24:00 GMT).Mr Trump has again declined to say whether he will accept the results.""We're going to see how things play out,"" the Republican candidate told Fox News on Tuesday, while alleging there had been voting irregularities. ""I want to see everything honest.""Some polling locations have reported equipment failures and long lines, but they appeared to be routine problems. Mr Trump filed a suit against the Clark County Registrar of Voters in Nevada, accusing the state of keeping early voting stations open longer than the designated closing time. But a judge rejected the request, citing concerns about revealing the identities of poll workers. The Manhattan real estate mogul's lawyers had asked for relevant early ballots not to be mixed with other ballots.Polling in Nevada shows the race between Mr Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, is extremely tight. Mrs Clinton voted at her local polling station in Chappaqua, New York, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at her side. The former Secretary of State told reporters: ""I know how much responsibility goes with this. ""So many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country, and I will do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today.""Results are expected some time after 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT on Wednesday) once voting ends on the West Coast.

The Scottish government is pressing for the Holyrood Parliament to be given a binding vote on Article 50 and will seek to oppose the UK government as it makes the case for its own involvement in the decision.The Welsh government has also said it intends to intervene in the appeal process to clarify the implications of the judgement for the future of devolution in Wales and the respective powers of the UK executive and the Welsh Assembly. And Northern Ireland's top lawyer has said a separate legal challenge to Brexit should ""leapfrog"" the usual legal process and go directly to the Supreme Court.The government said it was going to appeal almost as soon as the ruling came out and the Supreme Court has now granted permission - pushing through the process at a far faster pace than usual because of the importance of the case.After Lord Toulson's retirement this summer, the appeal will be heard by all 11 remaining Supreme Court justices, led by their President Lord Neuberger. At the completion of legal submissions, the justices will reserve their decision to a date ""probably in the new year"", a spokesman for the court said.He added: ""The Supreme Court will sit in its largest courtroom and make available a live video feed in the other two courtrooms in the building to enable as many members of the public as possible to observe proceedings.""It should be added that, as with all Supreme Court proceedings, this appeal will be live streamed on our website, so it is not necessary for people to attend the building in person to watch the hearing.""On Monday, Mrs May said: ""We believe the government has got strong legal arguments. We'll be putting those arguments to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will make its judgement.""The lead claimant in the case against the government, investment fund manager Gina Miller, has said it is vital that the UK's negotiating position is voted upon by MPs. She added that for this not to happen would mean ministers were acting like a ""tin-pot"" dictatorship.There is some debate about whether a vote at Westminster on invoking Article 50 would require a full Act of Parliament, or whether it could happen much more speedily by MPs and peers agreeing to a resolution - a written motion - instead.But Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested a full Act of Parliament is more likely should the government lose its case.In June's UK-wide referendum, voters opted by 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of leaving the EU."

Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, believes that the consent of the Scottish Parliament and the UK's other devolved parliaments and assemblies should also be sought before Article 50 is triggered. The Scottish government had legal representatives observing the High Court case, and later said it was considering whether to become directly involved when the appeal is heard.Confirming that it would seek to intervene, Ms Sturgeon said she believed Scotland should be treated as an ""equal partner"" in the United Kingdom.If the Supreme Court was to allow the Scottish government's intervention and ruled against the UK government, it could mean there would have to be a vote on Article 50 in Holyrood as well as in Westminster.The Welsh government has also said it will seek a role in the Brexit appeal case, while the Northern Ireland Attorney General has told a court in Belfast that one of two legal challenges to Brexit should be fast-tracked directly to the Supreme Court.Ms Sturgeon stressed that she was not attempting to veto the process of England and Wales leaving the EU.But she said the ""democratic wishes of the people of Scotland and the national parliament of Scotland cannot be brushed aside as if they do not matter"".Scotland voted to remain in the EU by 62% to 38% in June's referendum, while the UK as a whole voted by 52% to 48% to leave. Ms Sturgeon has pledged to do all she can to protect Scotland's place in Europe, and to maintain its membership of the single market. By BBC assistant political editor Norman SmithAs if Theresa May didn't have enough on her plate following last week's High Court ruling forcing the government to give MPs a say before Brexit is triggered, now the Scottish government has piled in.In effect it has said if MPs are going to be given a say, the Scottish Parliament should also have to give its approval.The difficulty for Mrs May is that she knows the Scottish Parliament is overwhelmingly opposed to Brexit and her fear will be that Nicola Sturgeon is in effect threatening to blow Brexit out of the water.Scotland's first minister insists she is not playing the veto card. She respects the right of the rest of the UK to leave the EU, but wants to protect the interests of Scotland which voted against Brexit.It may be she is simply trying to increase her leverage over Theresa May to try and secure a particular Brexit deal for Scotland - something Mrs May has already ruled out.But there is another problem and it is on delay - the danger that Brexit gets snarled up in the courts. We have already had the High Court ruling - the Supreme Court  will decide on the appeal in January - and now Scottish lawyers are piling in and the danger is the timetable of triggering Brexit by March gets put through the legal shredder.The first minister said: ""The Scottish government is clear that triggering Article 50 will directly affect devolved interests and rights in Scotland. ""And triggering Article 50 will inevitably deprive Scottish people and Scottish businesses of rights and freedoms which they currently enjoy.""It simply cannot be right that those rights can be removed by the UK government on the say-so of a prime minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent.""She also urged the prime minister to ""live up to her promise to treat Scotland as an equal partner in the United Kingdom and listen to the will of the people of Scotland"".Answering questions from journalists, the first minister was pressed on the basis on which the Scottish government will seek to involve itself in the case.She said: ""If there is a need for legislation in the House of Commons that raises the question of legislative consent, not just in the Scottish Parliament but in Wales and Northern Ireland as well.""If that is going to be an issue that the court is looking at... then it is absolutely right that the Scottish government is formally represented to make sure that the views that we would take around these processes are heard by the court.""The first minister said she would not go into the detail of what the Lord Advocate will argue, but made it clear she personally believes the UK government should seek approval for triggering Article 50 through a legislative consent motion at Holyrood.She also said she believes there are those both in the Welsh and Northern Irish governments who would take a similar view about their own parliaments.Ms Sturgeon is due to unveil proposals for a ""flexible Brexit"" - which would see Scotland remain in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves - in the coming weeks. The Supreme Court has set aside four days, from 5 until 8 December, for the appeal hearing, which will see all 11 Supreme Court justices sit on the panel.Judgment will be reserved at the conclusion of that hearing and follow at a later date, probably in the new year.All five parties in the Scottish Parliament backed remaining in the EU ahead of the referendum, but the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have warned Ms Sturgeon against using the result to push for a second vote on Scottish independence.Scottish Labour said it supported the objective of getting the ""best possible deal for Scotland"", which it said meant ""remaining part of the UK and retaining a close Scottish Greens MSP Ross Greer said it was ""reasonable that MSPs who represent the people of Scotland are consulted before any steps are taken to remove us from Europe against our wishes.""And Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie called on the prime minister to ""end all this and simply accept that there must be a democratic vote before Article 50 is invoked"".

2016-11-08,'Errors' in Met's VIP paedophile probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37912886,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNumerous errors were made in Scotland Yard's investigation into paedophile allegations against VIPs, an independent review has found.The decision to abandon Operation Midland should have been taken ""much earlier"", Sir Richard Henriques said.Five officers have been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) following the review.The Met Police commissioner accepted ""accountability for these failures"" and apologised to those involved. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: ""It is a matter of professional and personal dismay that the suspects in the investigation were pursued for so long when it could have been concluded much earlier.""He apologised to former head of the Army Lord Bramall, ex-MP Harvey Proctor and the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Brittan ""for the intrusion into their homes and the impact of Operation Midland on their lives"" after all three men were accused but subsequently cleared.Operation Midland was launched after claims that boys had been sexually abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies at locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s.It cost £2.5m, but closed in March without a single arrest or charge.Sir Richard, a retired High Court judge, examined eight investigations in total, also including Operation Yewtree - into sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile and others - and Operation Vincente - into a separate allegation that Lord Brittan raped a 19-year-old woman. Lord Brittan died in January 2015 without being told that the case against him had been dropped.Mr Proctor, who was cleared of being part of an alleged Westminster paedophile ring, said in a letter to Sir Bernard that he accepted the commissioner's apology ""without prejudice.""""But as I am sure you will be aware, the detrimental impact of Operation Midland on my family, friends and myself, has been irreversible,"" he went on. Mr Proctor said his respect for the police remained ""undiminished"", but added: ""I hope this travesty will never occur again.""  The review found 43 failings in Operation Midland, including believing the complainant, a man known as ""Nick"", for too long; one officer announcing that Nick's claims were ""credible and true""; and applying for search warrants with flawed information.The Met have confirmed that Nick is now being investigated for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice. Sir Richard said: ""The principal cause of the many failures in this investigation was poor judgement and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts and to react to them. ""A major contributing factor was the culture that 'victims' must be believed.""In all, Sir Richard made 25 recommendations, including:Analysis by Angus Crawford, BBC News correspondentPoor judgement. Those are the two words that ring out from this particular inquiry into the conduct of Operation Midland. There were 43 separate failings, an extraordinary number, and as a result five officers are being referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.But it appears of the 43, four were absolutely fatal.  First of all, officers believed that one of the complainants was credible for far too long. Secondly, in December 2014, only a month after Midland had been launched, officers described his accusations as ""credible and true"". The third error has gone slightly under the radar, but according to Sir Richard, the Met obtained search warrants for properties using flawed and incomplete evidence, which means they misled a judge. As he puts it, ""the gravity"" of that ""cannot be overstated"". And finally, the review concluded that the entire investigation should have been closed down much earlier. Sir Richard said the decision by those in charge of Operation Midland to search several premises, risking the names of the householders being made public, was a ""grave error of judgement"".Instead, the investigation could have been carried out speedily and without those named learning of it.There was also an ""unjustifiable imbalance"", he said, between the scrutiny of complainants and suspects.Lord Bramall and Mr Proctor were accused of the gravest of crimes and then left in a state of limbo while Nick was contacted on a regular basis and given ""chapter and verse"" on the progress of the investigation, he added.Peter Saunders, founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ""It's not a good day. But what I hope and I pray is that people who have been affected by these crimes - young people, children and the adults that they become - if they are able to report these crimes, still do so. ""Don't be put off by the hype around this particular failed operation.""A spokeswoman for London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""clear that a series of extremely serious errors were made by the Met"".She added: ""The mayor will now be seeking full assurances from the Met commissioner on the consistency of the quality of the force's investigations into sexual offences and guarantees that the failings of past investigations will not be repeated.""Deputy chairwoman of the IPCC Rachel Cerfontyne said the five officers referred to the watchdog ranged in rank from sergeant to deputy assistant commissioner, and a decision about whether to conduct a formal investigation into them would be taken in due course. One of those referred, deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse, said he did not believe that he or any other officer within Operation Midland had committed any misconduct. ""While it is right that lessons should be learned from Operation Midland I want to emphasise that my colleagues and I investigated the allegations made with the best of intentions."""
2016-11-08,Disability benefits test 'traumatic',https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-37900898,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA test for a disability benefit is ""traumatic"" for applicants and needs to change, according to former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb.  Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) help disabled people live an independent life.But the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP said applicants for PIPs found the test ""very intrusive"".The UK government said assessments were carried out by qualified health professionals.In his first interview on welfare since resigning from the government, Mr Crabb told BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme: ""Of course you do need a system of assessment when you're giving out taxpayers' money. ""But the way it has been done - I see this in my surgeries, every single MP in their surgery sees this - people who felt that the assessment procedure has been traumatic, intrusive, hasn't been a comfortable experience at all. And that's what we've got to fix.""We need to have a supportive assessment process that obviously comes to the right decision about the kind of money and resource that a disabled person needs.""  Mr Crabb spoke out a week after his successor Damian Green launched a consultation on reform of the Work Capability Assessment, which is used to apply for Employment Support Allowance.PIPs are not means-tested and are gradually replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA).They were introduced in 2013 and are being rolled out across the UK. Eventually, more than 150,000 people in Wales will be assessed for them.As secretary of state, Mr Crabb scrapped plans to cut PIPs benefits and his predecessor Iain Duncan Smith resigned over those proposed cuts in the Budget in March.However, some recipients, like 67-year-old Judith, from Ceredigion, said receiving PIPs had left them worse off.  Judith has primary and progressive multiple sclerosis and walks with the aid of a frame.The DLA she had received for 12 years was replaced by PIPs at the beginning of 2016, leaving her £1,400 a year worse off. ""This may seem just not very much really but when you haven't got much to start with, it is quite a difference,"" she said.A nurse with 25 years' experience who worked for assessment company Capita until earlier this year has claimed assessors do not necessarily have the right skills when it comes to some disabilities.He did not want to be identified but told the programme: ""A paramedic is very well designed to do the job of a paramedic. Have they got a lot of experience of somebody with MS, for example?""Perhaps somebody with a very physical condition like MS should be assessed by somebody like an occupational therapist, or physiotherapist. ""Somebody with severe mental health difficulties by a psychiatrically trained person - but that doesn't happen."" Capita said staff were suitably equipped and supported to carry out assessments and on-going training was provided. The Department for Work and Pensions said in a statement: ""Assessments for PIPs are carried out by qualified health professionals who combine their clinical knowledge with an understanding of the fact that not everyone with the same disability is impacted [upon] in the same way.""Decisions are made following the consideration of all information provided by the claimant, including any supporting evidence from their GP or medical specialist.""

""Who appears at the committee is a matter for them,"" said the prime minister's spokesman."
2016-11-08,Pubs 'should reveal alcohol calories',https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909337,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPub and bar owners should provide warnings on the health dangers of alcohol or be denied a licence, a parliamentary committee has heard.Alison Hernandez, Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, said customers should know ""what they are doing to their body"".Landlords should provide details of the calories in drinks and the impact of heavy drinking ""over time"", she said.Labour's Lord Davies of Stamford said it was ""unclear"" how this would work.The exchange came in a hearing staged by the House of Lords Licensing Act 2003 Committee, looking at the effect of that piece of legislation - which allowed 24-hour drinking in England and Wales - and how it might be improved.The act says councils have to look at issues of crime and disorder, public safety, prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm when granting or denying licences.Ms Hernandez told peers that health should be another consideration: ""Local authorities are responsible for public health now. It's moved from the NHS, so local authorities should be including that in their day-to-day decision-making anyway.""She said: ""It's about individuals understanding what they are doing to themselves, to their bodies, to their health. There's a responsibility on the licensees, I would argue, or there should be under this objective, to make people aware.""Just like we have on cigarette packets exactly what happens to you if you choose to smoke, it should say what happens to you if you choose to drink - and if you choose to drink to a certain amount, what that might have. ""It might be calories. It might be 'this is the amount of calories you are taking in'.""It might be public health information service that says the impact of sustained drinking over time. It may be that it affects the cost of the alcohol sale.""But Lord Davies was sceptical, admitting that previous public health campaigns on sugar consumption and smoking had worked, but wondering how landlords could do the same for alcohol.He said: ""It's quite unclear to me how they would apply a public health criterion in [granting licences]... It's the wrong instrument.""The 2003 Licensing Act came into force in 2005."
2016-11-08,Brexit appeal could 'undermine justice',https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37904160,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe justice system could be undermined if a ruling that only Parliament can trigger Brexit is overturned, a former lord chief justice has said.Lord Judge said it would be seen as a victory for pro-Brexit demonstrators should the Supreme Court reverse last week's controversial High Court ruling.The government, he told BBC Newsnight, had been too slow to defend judges following press attacks over the case.Ministers say they support judicial independence but also a free press.In a Commons statement on Monday, Brexit Secretary David Davis said it was ""perfectly proper"" for people to respect the integrity of the judicial process while disagreeing with individual judgements.He condemned what he said were ""deplorable"" attacks on social media on Gina Miller, the woman who instigated the legal challenge against the government, but also defended a free press which he said was as much a guarantor of democracy as judicial independence.  The government is appealing against Thursday's ruling that Parliament must give its consent before the UK can officially notify the EU of its intention to leave by triggering Article 50 - which Theresa May has said she wants to do by the end of March.The case is expected to be heard next month although the verdict might not come until early next year, raising doubts about the PM's ability to meet her stated timetable to begin negotiations on the UK's exit.Amid anger over the High Court ruling, which led the Daily Mail to label three of the most senior judges in England and Wales ""enemies of the people"", UKIP leader Nigel Farage has vowed to lead peaceful protests outside the Supreme Court in the run-up to the hearing.The Daily Express has claimed 100,000 people could join a march in Westminster on the first day of the Supreme Court hearing. Lord Judge, who was the most senior judge in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013 and who is now a crossbench peer, told BBC Newsnight that people were entitled to protest but he was concerned about the impact the case might have on the legal system.""People can march as much as they like,"" he said.""I don't think it makes any difference to the judicial decision but it does make a difference to public order.""Let's say for the sake of argument the Supreme Court decides the High Court was wrong, it will undoubtedly be conveyed as a victory for the demonstrators.""It won't be but that's what will be conveyed. And if that is conveyed, you've undermined the administration of justice.""Lord Judge said the judges who delivered last week's ruling, including his successor as lord chief justice Lord Thomas, carried out their duty and ""happened to decide that Parliament was sovereign"". He said Lord Chancellor Liz Truss had ""a statutory obligation"" to defend the judiciary in the face of what he said had been highly personal attacks on their integrity, but he had been disappointed by her response.""That is one of her functions, to defend the judiciary. And it was a little too late and not a lot. ""To say you believe in independence of judges is fine but it doesn't actually address why this matters at a particular time.""A number of Conservative MPs have said ministers could have spoken out earlier and more vehemently, with former Attorney General Dominic Grieve saying the response was ""muted"".But ex-Justice Secretary Michael Gove said the freedom of the press was ""also a precious thing"" and while the judgement ""deserved respect"", the democratic mandate arising from the 23 June vote - in which 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU - must also be heeded. A government spokesman said the Lord Chancellor was ""very clear her role is to protect the independence of the judiciary not to police the press"". The government has said it will not decide what to do until the Supreme Court reaches its judgement, with ministers said to be weighing up whether to seek authorisation to begin official Brexit talks through new legislation or through a one-off parliamentary resolution.Lord Judge said he would vote to trigger Article 50 when the matter came before the Lords.""I think the result of the referendum means that the wishes of the majority of the people have to be respected,"" he said.Former Chancellor Ken Clarke has called on the government to stop ""faffing around"", saying it could table a vote in the Commons on a simple motion before the Supreme Court hearing.Speaking at an event in Westminster, the veteran Europhile said he personally would vote against Article 50 but that it would comfortably be passed by the Commons."

Mr Hammond has already said he will prioritise spending on new homes and transport rather than following his predecessor George Osborne's aim to balance the books by 2020.The IFS said he now had ""two big decisions"" to make; one on whether he should increase spending or cut taxes to boost the economy and the second on what new fiscal targets he should announce.Mr Pope said given uncertainty over the economic outlook, Mr Hammond ""might be wise to respond cautiously for now"".""Any new fiscal targets should be reasonably flexible,"" he said.Several groups have reduced their UK growth forecasts and raised their inflation forecasts since the EU referendum.Last month, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for 2017 UK economic growth to 1.1% as it warned that the global recovery remains ""weak and precarious"".International body the OECD also cut its forecast for next year from 2% to 1%, saying: ""Uncertainty about the future path of policy and the reaction of the economy remains very high and risks remain to the downside.""Last week, the Bank of England upgraded its growth forecasts for this year and next, but cut expectations for 2018 to 1.5% from 1.8%."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-08,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

Ban cats from going outdoors. Bring back fish and chips wrapped in newspaper.These are three demands - all rejected -  from users of the government's e-petitions service.Petitions gaining more than 100,000 signatures can be considered for a debate in parliament. While some petitions - like Jamie Oliver's petition to tax sugary drinks - can make it all the way into law, others aren't quite so successful. But what the Petitions Committee gives to Jamie Oliver, it takes away from may others, rejecting petitions that fall foul of its standards - set out in full here. Here's a quick run through some of the most common reasons petitions never make it:The Petitions Committee can't nominate someone for an honour - there's already a system in place for members of the public to nominate people directly.There's hope for some petitioners though - this petition calling for police horses and dogs to be given the same legal protections as their human colleagues will be debated in parliament's Westminster Hall on 14 November. The most popular e-petitions ever cover some slightly less unusual subjects.The petition with the most signatures - over four million of them - called on the government to hold a second EU membership referendum if either Leave or Remain were backed by less than 60% of voters and saw a turnout of less than 75%.The petition, which attracted a flood of signatures after June's Brexit vote, was debated in September, but there's been no sign of another referendum. Another petition that gained widespread attention was a call for parliament to ban Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from entering the UK. It was debated in January 2016. Mr Trump remains free to visit Britain.Despite these petitions successfully making it into the debating chamber, one member of the public felt Parliament would be better off without having to talk about them:"
2016-11-08,Friendly smiles,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37896976,"If Theresa May was seeking to ramp up UK-India trade in smiles, salutes and friendly rhetoric, she'd have a world class deal already.The prime minister shared a long lunch, a long chat and two public platforms with her Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in New Delhi and she's sure to spend more time in future cultivating a personal and economic relationship she sees as vital to British prosperity after Brexit.But sealing a comprehensive trade deal demands more than smiles and salutes.India wants more visas for students and workers. Theresa May has shown no inclination to offer any broad commitment to a more liberal approach to Indian migration.There is no cap on visa numbers. The official UK line is Britain's doors are open to the ""brightest and the best"". Yet the UK is widely seen in India as wanting ""free trade in everything except people"".And Mrs May's anxiety to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is well-known and frequently stated.Today the prime minister promised to allow Indian travellers, maybe 10,000 over the coming two years, to pass UK immigration more easily at ports and airports - as easily as UK travellers. Successful high value travellers, of the kind most countries are keen to welcome, would have extra help and advice for their families and themselves.However, Mrs May also wants India to do more to facilitate the return of Indians who have overstayed their legal limit in the UK. That might mean more effort approving the documentation needed to return an overstayer home.Again, the British desire to bear down on net migration lies at the root of a tension in relations between the two countries.If Britain is going to make a success of Brexit in the broadest sense, it is vital to cultivate India, a trade market which has shrunk even as the Indian economy has grown. The political obstacles at home on the road to Brexit have yet to be negotiated. The challenges beyond already look daunting.Swashbuckling, dashing, gloriously reckless. Just a few of the epithets you'll never, ever, see applied to Theresa May. Yet it's hard to think of anyone who's had a more successful few months in today's politics. If she was a cricketer, she'd be Geoffrey Boycott.And if the Yorkshire and England cricket legend was here in New Delhi, he'd probably sing her praises. Which, as it happens, he is and he did.""She'll be like Margaret Thatcher,"" he told an admiring gaggle of cricket-loving journos who spotted him the the Taj Palace Hotel.""She's good. She doesn't need my advice. She's got a few more strokes than me.""""She has views and she's strong. Life is about integrity and principles - it should be. We want politicians like that with integrity, with principles, with honesty.""As any Test Match Special listener could tell you, when Geoffrey likes someone, he says so. And generally doesn't stop.

2016-11-08,Time to talk,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37845980,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkWhen proposing new laws, ministers can fill the statute books from the relative safety of their positions in government. But for the average backbench MP, the chance to make laws can seem a distant possibility.Their best chance comes around once a year, in the form of a random ballot.The prize? A chance for MPs to promote their pet project in the House of Commons by introducing it as a Private Members' Bill.Private Members' Bills can be introduced in three different ways. The first are ""Ten Minute Rule"" bills, where MPs make a speech of no more than 10 minutes to outline their position. Second are presentations to the Commons, where an MP might formally introduce the title of their bill.The third and most likely to make it onto the statute book are the ""Ballot Bills"", so-called because MPs take part in a random draw to decide who gets to propose a bill in the Commons. The system has its critics, among them the SNP MP who sponsored the ""Turing Bill"" to pardon gay men for obsolete sexual offences.""It is absurd for legislation to be decided by the deputy speaker pulling balls out of a jar. It seems altogether too random,"" John Nicolson says.If this sounds confusing, it's probably because it is.In a report on Private Members' Bills, the Commons' Procedure Committee called the process ""impenetrable"" and ""enormously damaging to the reputation of the House and to the legislative process"".Chairman of the committee, Broxbourne MP Charles Walker, says: ""One thing you have to do in this house is accept failure, but you need to have a fair crack at failure, and I don't think most backbenchers now have a fair crack at failure.""Even if an MP is lucky enough to propose their Private Members' Bill to the Commons, it is far from guaranteed that it will become law. Opposing MPs can stop these sorts of bills progressing by ""filibustering"" or ""talking them out"" during debates held on 13 Fridays throughout the year - a process the Procedure Committee report describes as ""speaking at inordinate length on the bill to ensure that the debate cannot conclude"" before the set time limit. Mr Nicolson's Private Members' Bill, the Sexual Offences (Pardons) Bill, fell after a government minister used up the time allotted for debating it by speaking for 25 minutes. There were cries of ""shame"" and ""shameful"" from some MPs as Justice Minister Sam Gyimah's speech brought the debate to a close.Speaking to the BBC Mr Nicolson said: ""I think voters consider filibustering to be wrong. And I agree with them. ""Filibustering is archaic, and often used to frustrate the Private Members' Bill process. If a minister doesn't talk out a bill, a hard core of obstructionist MPs often do it, talking nonsensically for lengthy periods until the time allocated for the bill is over."" Mr Gyimah defended his opposition to Mr Nicolson's bill, saying ""I understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson's bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences.""Conservative MP Philip Davies, a regular attendee of Friday debates on Private Members' Bills, mounted a passionate defence of talking out. Speaking to a Procedure Committee evidence session Mr Davies said: ""I support a bill by not speaking at all, and stop a bad bill from going forward by running out of time.""If the purpose of me contributing to the debate is to try to stop bills that I think are bad, this is the mechanism that I have to use, under the rules,"" he continued.""If there was another mechanism of blocking them that didn't involve me speaking in the debate, the chances are that I would use that mechanism and therefore nobody would hear another point of view. You would only hear one side.""Mr Davies concluded: ""When we have a debate, whether people like the outcome or not, at least people get to hear that there is a different opinion on a particular bill.""Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had a similar experience of a bill being talked out in 2015. Her ""NHS Reinstatement"" bill ran out of time after MPs spent four-and-a-half hours debating the two-clause Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) bill. Ms Lucas told the Procedure Committee the bill was one that ""certain MPs have 'on the shelf' for the purpose of clogging up Private Members' Bill time on Fridays"". The Brighton Pavilion MP told the BBC: ""What really turns the public off politics is witnessing the childish way some MPs speak for a huge amount of time in order to 'talk out' bills and prevent them from being concluded and voted on.""While talking out has many opponents, there are ways of clamping down on the practice that already exist.In its recommendations for changes to the Private Members' Bill process, the Procedure Committee suggested that the Speaker and his deputies overseeing debates on them should make greater use of their existing ability to impose time limits on speeches.Equally, an MP sponsoring a Private Members' Bill can attempt to close a debate before it runs out of time. The problem is that to do so 100 MPs have to be present in the chamber - a requirement the committee's report called a ""a formidable hurdle"" to overcome on Fridays, when many MPs have already returned to their constituencies. In the end, opponents of talking out may be disappointed, because the Procedure Committee stopped short of calling for a ban.Warning against applying more rules to Commons debates, the committee instead suggested limiting opportunities to indulge in the practice.""The more rules there are, the greater the opportunities to game them,"" it said."

Including students is standard practice. If all the international students who came to study for more than a year left again at the end of their courses then, over time, they would have no impact on net migration figures. If the way the figures are collected was perfect (which it is not - it is a survey) then they would be counted in at the start of their courses and counted out at the end of them.Removing students from the net migration figures would reduce them considerably for three or four years, but have no impact after that.But the reason that the statisticians keep students in the net migration figures is that there is a gap between the numbers arriving and the numbers leaving.In the year to the end of June 2015, 184,000 students came to the UK planning to stay for at least a year, while 57,000 students who had started courses in previous years left.The ONS said that gap had been fairly consistent since 2012, when it started collecting figures in this way.That gap makes a big difference to the net migration figures - it's a gap of 127,000 a period when total net migration to the UK was 336,000.Some of this gap could be down to the imperfections in the International Passenger Survey, which is a big survey, interviewing 700,000 to 800,000 people a year, but is still a survey and hence only an estimate. And there are particular problems with sampling students, for example, somebody doing a master's degree may say on arrival that they are planning to stay for a year but then leave after 11 months, meaning that they would be counted as a long-term migrant as they arrived but not as they left.Some of the gap will be down to people who have extended their visas or obtained new ones, having started new courses or found skilled work, for example.And there will be people who have finished their courses and outstayed their visas.To get an idea of how many people are extending their student visas, the Home Office says that in 2014, 75,000 people were granted an extension of stay in the UK to study, of whom 12,000 had previously been on non-study visas. That figure for extensions was relatively low, having averaged 127,000 over the previous three years.Lord Bilimoria said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years.It has actually fallen by more than that, with 68,238 study visas issued to Indian nationals in the year to June 2010, falling to 11,864 five years later, according to official figures.The rules have indeed been tightened, with students from outside the EU wanting to extend their study visas, for example, having to do so from outside the UK and visas no longer allowing students to seek work in the UK after graduation.Nonetheless, over that same period, the number of students coming from China to the UK rose from 39,695 to 68,294.

Writing under the headline ""Visa cloud over trade ties as British PM Theresa May arrives in India"", Jayanth Jacob of leading daily Hindustan Times said ""the stringent visa regulations by the British cast a shadow over the prospect of the two countries hammering out an ambitious trade and investment partnership post-Brexit"". Jacob quoted S Irudayarajan, migration expert and consultant for government on mobility issues, as saying that ""India is an important country for the UK. And curbing the flow of good minds whether they are students or skilled workers is not good for the UK"".Reflecting similar sentiments, The Times of India published an editorial titled ""Muddled May"". ""As the second largest global job creator in Britain and its third largest source of foreign direct investment, India finds these British policies both objectionable and puzzling. How does the UK hope to forge closer trade ties with India while growing increasingly disagreeable to Indian trade professionals?"" A UK-India free trade agreement would be a ""non-starter as long as the visa issue isn't sorted"", added the Times of India. In an opinion piece on news portal DailyO headlined: ""Post-Brexit, Britain is no lure for Indian students, and Theresa May's no help"", columnist K Srinivasan notes that ""Britain used to be the preferred destination for higher education, coupled with lucrative employment in related fields of study, for people from many countries, including India. But not any more, as the country's immigration laws get tighter and the impact of Brexit surfaces slowly"".Business daily The Economic Times in a piece headlined ""Where great minds meet"" concurs, saying: ""With the contentious issue of immigration in the background, PM May has her hands full on this visit to India, seeking a quick and favourable trade deal, while looking to project the UK as a truly global and forward looking nation."" Television channel NDTV also notes that: ""IT professionals have asked how there can be better trade, with Mrs May's government making it tougher for Indian professionals to travel to that country with tougher new rules for visa and immigration.""BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2016-11-08,Special relationship?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37851551,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkDonald Trump could be elected president of the United States within days. But what plans has the UK got in place for this eventuality and what could it mean for its place in the world?Picture the scene. It is 20 January 2017 and a cold wind is blowing across Washington's Capitol as Donald John Trump raises his right hand and proclaims that he will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.As he looks the chief justice in the eye, hundreds of millions of people around the world wonder what his four-year term will bring.Among them are UK civil servants and politicians, pondering - with negotiations for leaving the European Union also soon to begin - what all this means for their country.It could happen. So, how well prepared is the UK for dealing with Mr Trump, who has never previously held elected office, and how is the future looking?The UK and US share a language and much cultural heritage, but, argues Tim Oliver, a fellow in European-North American relations at the London School of Economics, the truly ""special"" quality in their relationship is the sharing of intelligence, as well as co-operation over nuclear weapons and special forces.Mr Oliver says there is a risk this could ""sour"" because of the ""degree of distrust and unease"" felt by the government towards Mr Trump, ""an erratic president who appears willing to do anything when it comes to torture, bombing, relations with authoritarian states"".Critics accuse Mr Trump of isolationism, but he describes his foreign policy stance as one of ""Americanism, not globalism"". He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.The UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?""A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,"" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. ""But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.""Before the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to ""the back of the queue"" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.His trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he ""absolutely"" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.""I could see that happening,"" says Ms Schake, ""especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  ""A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.""Mr Trump's website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.Theresa May has not offered an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".Asked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: ""I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.""The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,"" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.Tony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. More trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.The problem is, Ms Schake argues, that ""Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding"", adding: ""But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.""Personal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.""Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,"" says Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government.""Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.""I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?""Many mainstream Republicans have criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush as well as Mr McCain.We know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, would be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr Trump is a hugely famous man, with a long career in business and a career in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many ""known unknowns"", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.Another complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.Then, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with ""unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next"".""I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,"" says Ms Rutter.""If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.""

2016-11-08,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161108235119/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

""Britain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise.""We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence. ""I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.""In December 2015 she criticised the Republican's call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, saying it was ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".At the time Mrs May, who was then home secretary, also said Mr Trump's remark that police were afraid to enter some parts of London because of radicalisation was ""nonsense"", saying: ""I just think it shows he does not understand the UK and what happens in the UK.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted his congratulations to Mr Trump and said he was ""much looking forward to working with his administration on global stability and prosperity"".Like Mrs May, he has previously attacked Mr Trump's comments about London, saying that ""the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump"".Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's victory was ""a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened"".He added: ""And the public anger that has propelled Donald Trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world.""The Labour leader also said Mr Trump's campaign had been ""nasty and divisive"" and that he looked forward to ""robust discussions"" with the president-elect about climate change and the importance of the United Nations.Ms Sturgeon congratulated Mr Trump but said his victory was not the outcome she had hoped for, adding: ""I hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America.""Her predecessor Alex Salmond said Mr Trump - who has extensive business interests in Scotland - said the President-elect was a ""protectionist"" when it came to trade but he hoped that his views would change in the White House.""The difficulty with Donald Trump is not when he's winning, it's when he's not getting his own way,"" he said.""He's nice as nine pence when he's getting his own way. It's what happens when he reaches road blocks, obstacles, when somebody says no to him... In these circumstances we'd better all just hope that the Presidency changes a man."" Mr Trump was criticised by a number of UK MPs during the campaign, including during a Commons debate in January on banning him from the country.As Westminster reacted to his victory, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the values of ""moderation, freedom, respect for the rule of law, openness and concern for one another"" had been defeated, while Green Party joint leader Caroline Lucas said it was ""a devastating day"".However, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant highlighted Mr Trump's reported enthusiasm for a trade deal with the UK, comparing this with the outgoing president's ""back of the queue"" comment.Mr Farage, who joined Mr Trump on stage during the campaign, congratulated him on his ""brave"" campaign.""We now have a President who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values,"" he said. ""Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives.""Steve Hilton, a former adviser to David Cameron in Downing Street, said the Republican tycoon won because Americans could see in him ""someone who might make a difference to their lives"".Sir Peter Westmacott, who was UK Ambassador to the US until earlier this year, said Mr Trump had been a ""law until himself"" during the campaign and it was not clear who would form his foreign policy team.While there were significant policy differences that would need to be ""ironed out"", he told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the UK's relationship with the US was strong and it was natural for Mrs May to want a ""fresh start"" following Trump's election.

The UKIP leader, who appeared with Mr Trump during the election, said he ""liked"" the UK and valued the special relationship between the nations.He said reports that Mr Trump might give him a job were a ""bit premature"".But the UK needed to ""get cracking"" in dialogue over trade and other issues and he was willing to help.Prime Minister Theresa May has written to Mr Trump following his victory over Hillary Clinton, affirming the UK's commitment to work with him ""to build on the enduring and special relationship between our two countries and to ensure our shared security and prosperity in the years ahead"".It has been reported that Mr Farage and other senior UKIP figures will meet Mr Trump this weekend after his victory.The UKIP leader, who is due to stand down at the end of the month, met Mr Trump several times during the campaign and has been linked with a job in the Trump administration - potentially even as his envoy to the EU.This, he said, was ""somewhat premature"" but he said he would be willing to play a role in facilitating links between the Trump administration and the UK before he formally takes office in January.""I do have a relationship with Trump and his team,"" he told the BBC during a trip to Spain. ""I think it is important that the British government gets on with this guy.""If I can do anything to help the relationship between the UK and America, via Donald Trump, I will do that.""He said he was confident that Donald Trump would strengthen the much-vaunted special relationship between the two countries, claiming his victory meant ""at last we have a US president who likes our country"".There was a much greater prospect of the UK agreeing a free trade deal with the US after it leaves the EU with Mr Trump in the White House than either his opponent or the current incumbent.""President Obama and Hillary Clinton have treated us with disdain,"" he claimed. ""They thought we were a little country, not very relevant any more. Trump's mother was Scottish. He values the special relationship and he has told me that himself.""Famously Obama said we would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if we voted for Brexit. Donald Trump has said we would be at the front of the queue.""Asked about Mr Trump's personality and what kind of president he would be, the UKIP leader accepted that the businessman could be a ""bit brash and out there"" on the campaign trail but that he was rather different in private.""In private, one-to-one, I found him amenable and he will listen,"" he said, adding that the ""success or otherwise"" of Mr Trump's presidency would depend on the people he surrounded himself with.While many of Mr Trump's policies - such as his pledge to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall between the US and Mexico - were not as ""outlandish"" as portrayed in the media, Mr Farage said he would have to make them happen.""There is no question that there is going to be big pressure on Trump to deliver. Trump voters, the Brexit voters, want action. They don't want their votes, their overturning of the establishment to get kicked into the long grass.""There is an element of anger among those voters. But it is more than that.

2016-11-09,Families win against housing benefit cut,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37921766,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA woman who has spina bifida and a couple who look after their severely-disabled grandson have won their Supreme Court appeals against the so-called ""bedroom tax"".The court ruled that the government's changes to housing benefit discriminated against them.But five other people had similar challenges dismissed by the court.The court said councils should be able to decide which tenants were given discretionary payments to help them.Disability campaigners have been protesting against the system, which removed subsidies for social housing tenants who were deemed to have ""spare"" rooms in their homes, since it was introduced by the government in 2013.Dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour, tenants affected had payments cut by 14% for one spare bedroom and 25% for two or more spare bedrooms.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had argued that it had given councils money to make discretionary payments to people facing hardship because of the policy change.Welcoming the ruling, a DWP spokesman said: ""In most cases, local authorities are best placed to understand the needs of their residents."" Delivering the judgement on Wednesday, Lord Toulson said the judges had unanimously agreed that the claim the benefit change had discriminated against disabled people was ""too broad"".He said: ""There is a line to be drawn between on the one hand those who have a medical need for an additional bedroom and on the other hand, those who do not have a direct medical need for an additional room but may have powerful reasons for staying where they are, because of their particular personal circumstances.""For spina bifida patient Jacqueline Carmichael, 44, from Southport, Merseyside, the need for an extra bedroom was medical, he said, with judges unanimously ruling that ""the scheme in relation to her is discriminatory"".Her condition means she has to sleep in a hospital bed in a fixed position. There is not enough space for a second bed so her husband Jayson sleeps in a separate bedroom. Mr Carmichael brought the court challenge along with four others after suffering defeat at both the High Court and Court of Appeal in January.Outside the court on Wednesday, he said he hoped their victory would help others.He said: ""It's put a dent in this undemocratic policy which was never, never voted, never in any party's manifesto in the first place, the 'bedroom tax'.  ""We are pleased now, we hope Theresa May will look at the policy again so that, so that it will take into consideration a lot of people's personal circumstances, which it hasn't in the past.""The court also ruled in favour of Pembrokeshire couple Paul and Susan Rutherford and their 15-year-old grandson Warren. Their case focused on the impact of the policy on disabled children needing overnight care. Speaking outside the court, Mr Rutherford said: ""It's probably the best day we've had in the last three-and-a-half years and we're just really glad that it's all over.  ""Glad that we've won for everybody else who's in our situation, because there's quite a few out there who are.""  However, the judges rejected the cases of five others who have had their housing benefit reduced as a result of the government's changes. They are:The solicitor for the woman known as ""A"" said her client intended to challenge the ruling in the European Court of Human Rights, for the breach of her rights and ""other vulnerable women whose lives are at risk"".Rebekah Carrier, at Hopkin Murray Beskine solicitors, added: ""Although we welcome today's ruling that A must continue to receive Sanctuary Scheme protection for as long as she needs it, we are disappointed and frankly baffled by the majority's finding that there is no need to formally exempt Sanctuary Scheme users from the effects of the bedroom tax.""Lord Toulson said there was ""no dispute"" that A needed protection under the government's Sanctuary Scheme. However, he said that her property, which has been adapted, was larger than she needed and she did not necessarily need to stay in it.The government argues that the benefit changes encourage people to move to smaller properties and saves about £480m a year from the housing benefit bill.A DWP spokesman said: ""It is welcome that the court found in our favour in five out of the seven cases. ""The court also agreed with our view that discretionary housing payments are generally an appropriate and lawful way to provide assistance to those who need extra help.  In the two specific cases where the court did not find in our favour, we will take steps to ensure we comply with the judgement in due course."""
2016-11-09,Sturgeon congratulates Trump on victory,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37916648,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkScotland's first minister has congratulated Donald Trump on his surprise election win despite admitting it was ""not the outcome I wanted"". Nicola Sturgeon publicly backed Hillary Clinton ahead of the presidential vote. But she said the result of the election should be respected, and that Scotland valued its relationship with the US. Ms Sturgeon removed Mr Trump from a list of Scottish business ambassadors when he suggested Muslims would be stopped from entering the US. Her predecessor as first minister, Alex Salmond, has previously backed calls for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK.Mr Trump is to become the 45th US president after a stunning victory over Mrs Clinton, the Democrat candidate.The Republican nominee's victory came down to a handful of key swing states, despite months of polling that favoured Mrs Clinton.As he addressed supporters at a victory rally in New York, Mr Trump said it was ""time for us to come together as one united people"".President-elect Trump's mother, Mary MacLeod, was born in the village of Tong on Lewis in the Western Isles in 1912.She left the island at the age of 18 for a holiday in New York, where she met and later married local builder Fred Trump.Their son Donald spoke of his late mother's Scottish heritage in 2006 when he bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, turning it into a golf resort against the wishes of local residents.In April 2014, the 70-year-old US tycoon also purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire.Mr Trump also unsuccessfully challenged Scottish government ministers in court over their decision to approve an offshore wind farm near his Aberdeenshire golf course. Responding to the result, Ms Sturgeon said: ""While this is not the outcome I hoped for, it is the verdict of the American people and we must respect it. I congratulate President-Elect Trump on winning the election.""We value our relationship with the United States and its people. The ties that bind Scotland and the US - of family, culture and business - are deep and longstanding and they will always endure.""Ms Sturgeon said the result had left many people in the US and across the world with a ""real sense of anxiety"".She added: ""I hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalized by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America.""Today must also be a moment for those who share progressive values - all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity - to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold dear.""The first minister also paid tribute to Mrs Clinton, saying her candidacy had represented a ""major step forward for women in America and across the world"".Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland she did not regret backing Mrs Clinton during the election, calling some of Mr Trump's comments during the campaign ""undoubtedly racist"".She added: ""The comments made during the campaign were deeply offensive to many different groups in society and there's a need now and a big responsibility on his shoulders to bring people together.""I'm never going to shy away from my believe in articulating principles of tolerance and respect and diversity and multiculturalism.""The relationship between Scotland and America is an important one, and I'm not going to, because of my own personal views, risk the interests of Scotland by not engaging with the American government. But the nature of that engagement will depend to some extent on how Donald Trump conducts himself as President.""UK Prime Minister Theresa May has also congratulated Mr Trump on his election as US president, and said Britain and America would remain ""strong and close partners"".But several Scottish political figures have expressed their shock and disappointment over Mr Trump's victory. Mr Salmond, who is now the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, said his own disappointment at the result was ""as of nothing"" compared to the people, religions and racial minorities who had been ""demeaned and insulted by Donald Trump"" during the campaign.The former first minister added: ""The difficulty with Donald Trump is not when he's winning, it's not when he's getting his own way, he's nice as ninepence when he's getting his own way.""It's what happens when he reaches road blocks, obstacles, when somebody says no to him. In these circumstances we'd better all just hope that the presidency changes a man."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said it was not the result she wanted, and expressed her hope that ""President Trump turns out to be a different man to candidate Trump"".Her Scottish Labour counterpart, Kezia Dugdale, said it was a ""dark day"" and accused Mr Trump of running a ""hate-filled campaign that was dominated by lies, misogyny and racism"". Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie called on the Scottish government to shun Mr Trump, who Mr Harvie described as a ""racist, sexist bully"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the UK should use its ""special relationship"" with the US to ""stand up for the different minorities in his country who will wake up today more fearful than they have for decades"".However, UKIP's Scottish leader, David Coburn, predicted Mr Trump would be ""good for Scotland"" because of his strong connections to the country. The endorsements of Mrs Clinton by Scottish politicians could backfire once Mr Trump formally become president, according to Fiona Hill, an analyst at the Brookings think tank in Washington.She said: ""It might actually matter because Donald Trump does take things quite personally. ""He's made it quite clear that when he has a rift on a personal and business level that he's quite serious about responding.""But the former US assistant Secretary of State, Kurt Volker, doubted that these past concerns would feature prominently in the new president's thinking. He said the focus would instead be on global issues including Russia, the economy, Islamic State and forging a new relationship with the UK after Brexit. More than 1,000 students from the University of Edinburgh packed into the city centre to watch the battle for the White House unfold at an event dubbed by organisers as ""the largest US election night party in the UK outside of London"". Organised by Edinburgh University North American Society and the Edinburgh Political Union, the sold-out event in Potterrow saw TV screens beaming results live from across the Atlantic with experts from the school of history providing live analysis on the results throughout the night. The US Consulate General also held an event on Tuesday night at Edinburgh University with hundreds of North American ex-pats attending to watch the results come in. At Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf course, Sarah Malone, executive vice president of Trump International, said it was a ""truly historic day"" and he would serve with ""unwavering passion and commitment"".However, Menie resident Susan Munro, who fought Trump over his golf development, said her reaction to the win was ""shock horror"".She added: ""He would not have been my choice anyway. It will be interesting""."

""The United States is one of Wales' most important trading partners and by far our largest market for inward investment. We will maintain a strong presence in America, including opening our latest office in Atlanta,"" the first minister added.The UK government's Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the relationship between the UK and the US ""goes much deeper than any one individual, be it a leader in this country or a leader in the United States"".He said: ""It's about the people, it's about our cultures. We are so closely aligned and of course we will do everything to make the Trump presidency a success."" Andrew RT Davies tweeted the result was ""yet another punch for political polling - seems another remarkable failure on that front"".He said it was: ""Another bloody nose for the political establishment.""Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood called for ""calm heads"" and the need for ""winding down the rhetoric"".""If Trump wants to do business with the rest of the world, he must row back on the appalling comments we saw throughout the campaign,"" she said.Neil Hamilton, UKIP's leader in the assembly, said: ""It's an uprising of people against the Washington establishment in the same way as Brexit was an uprising against the European establishment.""He said he was surprised Mr Trump won, but believed it was ""good news for Britain"".""Far from [outgoing president] Barack Obama saying we'll be at the back of the queue in a trade deal, Donald Trump has made it perfectly clear he's very pro-Britain which is good news,"" Mr Hamilton said.Flintshire-based David Soutter, a former head of candidates for UKIP who worked on the UK Trump campaign, said the Republican candidate's victory was ""very easy to predict"".""For 25 years the political establishment has grown apart from those whom it is supposed to represent,"" he said.""It is clear in Europe and the UK, and it was very clear in the US.""Sending his congratulations, Monmouth Conservative MP David Davies told his Twitter followers: ""Surprise of media and anger of commentators shows their failure to listen to, or understand a silent majority.""Former Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said: ""America is a great nation. Still is.""Strong and tested institutions will cope, and our deep and wide friendship with US more important than ever.""However, many Labour politicians reacted with concern, with Neath AM Jeremy Miles saying on Twitter that it was a ""dark morning""."

However, neither markets nor currencies have swung as wildly as they did after June's EU referendum.The dollar has regained ground it lost earlier. Although it is still down against the pound, it is now up against both the euro and the yen.  US stock futures fell dramatically overnight when Mr Trump won key swing states, with traders at one point forecasting the Dow Jones to lose 4% or 800 points. The sell-off hit Asian share markets, leading to them being described as a ""sea of red"" in early trading, before seeing their losses narrow.

Meanwhile, concerns about the impact of a Trump presidency on the Mexican economy saw its currency, the peso, fall more than 13% overnight against the dollar to its lowest level in two decades. It has since pulled that back slightly to an 8% loss.Mexico is expected to suffer from a Trump presidency because of his pledges to build a wall along the US border with the country and renegotiate the two nations' trade agreement."

He claimed a shock victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's election.First Minister Arlene Foster said she looked forward to working with his administration. She said Northern Ireland has ""strong historical, economic and political ties to the United States"". ""As our largest inward investor, the US plays a massive role in our economic progress,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said he would ""work constructively with President Trump"" to ""maintain and strengthen our well established and deeply valued relationship with the US"".""Over many years, successive US administrations have made a major contribution to both our peace process and economic development and I expect this to continue,"" he said. In comparison to Hillary Clinton, who made several visits to Northern Ireland over the past 21 years, Donald Trump is more of an unknown quantity so far as most Stormont politicians are concerned. But not entirely unknown. The New York billionaire shook hands with Gerry Adams at a Manhattan fundraiser in 1995. More recently, he met the late Ian Paisley in 2007 to discuss buying a North Coast golf resort. But the deal never came off.He does own a golf resort in County Clare which he referred to both as ""perfecto"" and ""small potatoes"" during the campaign. Some locals in Doonbeg hope Donald Trump will do for them what Barack Obama did for Moneygall.The kind of access Stormont politicians might have enjoyed at the White House under a Hillary Clinton presidency seems unlikely under Mr Trump. Indeed in the wake of controversy over some of Donald Trump's comments about women and Muslims the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood pledged not to attend a Trump St Patrick's Day reception.But to be honest no-one had expected that Northern Ireland would be or should be anywhere near the top of a new US President's bulging in tray. Those days are long gone and we are now entering a new era for the world, never mind Northern Ireland.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood reiterated his pledge not to attend a Trump White House.""I feel it is important that as an Irish leader I take a stand, even if only small and only symbolic, for the kind of politics which we continue to believe in,"" he said.""Across the western world, politics is facing a dark and difficult moment. ""As Rowan Williams recently wrote, we are now understandably terrified about the potential triumph of a politics of resentment, fear and unchallengeable untruthfulness.""Alliance leader Naomi Long also expressed disappointment over the election.""The problem with a protest vote is that you're left then with a protest president. What does a protest president look like in such an uncertain world?"" she said.""It will be interesting to see if can he unite the (Republican) party and then can he unite the country.""However, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt congratulated Mr Trump on his victory and said he looked forward to continued US engagement with Northern Ireland.Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Enda Kenny also congratulated Mr Trump.""I look forward to working with the new administration in the time ahead in the cause of international peace and security,"" he said.Mr Kenny also praised defeated candidate Hillary Clinton for being ""a friend to Ireland who fought such a tough campaign"".US firms employ more than 20,000 people in Northern Ireland.There might also be concern about whether a crackdown on immigration from Mexico could have consequences for the undocumented Irish working in the USA.The Republican president-elect adopted a protectionist economic stance during his campaign, talking about renegotiating trade deals and imposing tariffs.If he turns that into policy it could mean a less open global trade system which would not be not good for small economies banking on export-led growth, adds our correspondent.Mr Trump has also said he will reduce the headline rate of US corporation tax from 35% to 15%.That could have particular implications for the Republic of Ireland which has attracted lots of tax sensitive US investment.It could also make weaken the impact of the Northern Ireland Executive's plan to use reduced corporation tax as a tool for attracting investment, adds our correspondent."

Ministers will also launch a consultation on dangerous driving offences by the end of the year.Speaking during a visit to India, Mrs May said she wanted to make using a mobile phone at the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving.She said the government would work with the public to ""raise awareness"" of the dangers of driving and dialling.She said that punishments for drivers who killed and maimed people because their attention had been on their phone should be made to ""fit the crime"", as a deterrent to other motorists.The number of fines issued for motorists caught using a mobile phone illegally has plummeted by 84% since 2011.Some 16,900 drivers were handed fixed-penalty notices in England and Wales last year, compared with 123,100 in 2011, Home Office data shows.Motoring groups believe the decline is due to a 27% fall in the number of full-time dedicated roads policing officers in England and Wales (excluding London) between 2010 and 2015.Department for Transport figures show that a driver being impaired or distracted by their phone had been a contributory factor in 440 accidents in Britain last year, including 22 which were fatal and 75 classed as serious.Mrs May said: ""Sadly, we have seen too many times the devastating and heart-breaking consequences of using a mobile phone while driving. ""A moment's distraction can wreck the lives of others forever.""We are determined to make our roads safer by taking action against those who flout the law and put other people at risk.""Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: ""By ruling out courses and doubling the fine, ministers are reflecting public concern and showing they want to stamp out a potentially lethal activity before it becomes entrenched behaviour for a growing number of drivers.""The measures will not affect Northern Ireland, where drivers are currently given three penalty points and a £60 fine for the offence.The Department for Infrastructure has said there are no plans to change this, but it ""will continue to monitor changes being made in Britain to see what can be learned""."
2016-11-09,Brexit court ruling appeal date set,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37913911,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government's appeal against the High Court ruling that MPs must vote on triggering Brexit will be heard in the Supreme Court from 5 December.It will last four days, with the decision expected in the new year.Theresa May has said she is ""clear"" she expects to start talks on leaving the EU as planned by the end of March.Campaigners say MPs and peers have to scrutinise the government's plans beforehand, but ministers say they can decide without this happening.The High Court ruled last Thursday that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which triggers up to two years of formal EU withdrawal talks.Labour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process if a vote goes ahead but pressure is mounting on the government from the devolved legislatures. The Scottish government is pressing for the Holyrood Parliament to be given a binding vote on Article 50 and will seek to oppose the UK government as it makes the case for its own involvement in the decision.The Welsh government has also said it intends to intervene in the appeal process to clarify the implications of the judgement for the future of devolution in Wales and the respective powers of the UK executive and the Welsh Assembly. And Northern Ireland's top lawyer has said a separate legal challenge to Brexit should ""leapfrog"" the usual legal process and go directly to the Supreme Court.The government said it was going to appeal almost as soon as the ruling came out and the Supreme Court has now granted permission - pushing through the process at a far faster pace than usual because of the importance of the case.After Lord Toulson's retirement this summer, the appeal will be heard by all 11 remaining Supreme Court justices, led by their President Lord Neuberger. At the completion of legal submissions, the justices will reserve their decision to a date ""probably in the new year"", a spokesman for the court said.He added: ""The Supreme Court will sit in its largest courtroom and make available a live video feed in the other two courtrooms in the building to enable as many members of the public as possible to observe proceedings.""It should be added that, as with all Supreme Court proceedings, this appeal will be live streamed on our website, so it is not necessary for people to attend the building in person to watch the hearing.""On Monday, Mrs May said: ""We believe the government has got strong legal arguments. We'll be putting those arguments to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will make its judgement.""The lead claimant in the case against the government, investment fund manager Gina Miller, has said it is vital that the UK's negotiating position is voted upon by MPs. She added that for this not to happen would mean ministers were acting like a ""tin-pot"" dictatorship.There is some debate about whether a vote at Westminster on invoking Article 50 would require a full Act of Parliament, or whether it could happen much more speedily by MPs and peers agreeing to a resolution - a written motion - instead.But Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested a full Act of Parliament is more likely should the government lose its case.In June's UK-wide referendum, voters opted by 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of leaving the EU."
2016-11-09,Great Western modernisation costs rocket,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37914853,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has been blamed for huge extra costs and lengthy delays to the modernisation of the Great Western railway network in England and Wales.The National Audit Office (NAO) says the estimated cost of the project since 2013 has shot up by £2.1bn to £5.6bn.Meanwhile delays have added between 18 and 36 months to the project's timescale.Yesterday the government said electrification of four short parts of the network would now be ""deferred"".The audit office's report puts the blame for the project's problems firmly on poor government planning.It said the modernisation plan was a ""case study in how not to manage a major programme"".""Before 2015, the Department of Transport did not plan and manage all the projects which now make up the Great Western route modernisation industry programme in a sufficiently joined up way,"" said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO.The Great Western network, which stretches from London out to South Wales and the south west of England, is particularly busy and overcrowded.The number of passengers arriving at Paddington during the daily peak period is predicted to rise by 81% in the five years up to 2018-19.Because it will take longer to electrify the lines, the government has been forced to change a multi-billion pound order for new, all-electric trains. They will now have to be fitted with diesel engines, so that they can go anywhere, but that makes them heavier, which means they are more expensive to run, more polluting and do more damage to the track. They may even be slower than the trains they are replacing, so believe it or not, journeys could possibly take longer. And it is not just passengers in the south west that will suffer. When one line gets brand new trains, the old stock is used to upgrade services in different parts of the country. So problems in the west country may also mean people in the north of England and Scotland have to wait longer for their better trains.Modernisation of the Great Western network started in 2014 and involves electrifying various lines including the one between Maidenhead and Cardiff; ordering new trains; modifying or building new bridges; and changing various services.Among the problems identified by the NAO were that by the time an overall plan was eventually devised last year:The result, the NAO said, was that electrification alone would cost an extra £330m and the extent of that element should now be reconsidered.The government auditor also said that the new trains would have to be reconfigured so that they could run under both electrical and diesel power.Meanwhile the Great Western franchise operator, FirstGroup, would have to bear much higher costs which, combined with less passenger revenue than expected, meant the government would earn less money than expected from the franchise.Mr Morse added an optimistic note, saying: ""It is encouraging that since 2015 the department and Network Rail have a better grip and put in place structures to manage the programme in an integrated way."" ""However, significant challenges to the timetable still remain and there is more to do to achieve value for money,"" he added. But Meg Hillier MP, chair of the parliamentary committee of public accounts, was not impressed.""The Department for Transport and Network Rails' failure to integrate crucial elements of the modernisation into one programme from the start has cost passengers and taxpayers' time and money,"" she said. ""I do not understand why it took the department two years from agreeing to buy new trains to produce a business case,"" she added."
2016-11-09,May: Migration curbs won't damage trade,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37908605,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May has insisted the UK can increase international trade while curbing immigration, saying a ""world of opportunities"" awaits after Brexit.On a visit to India, the PM told the BBC businesses were ""very keen"" to strengthen their ties with Britain.She played down the Institute for Fiscal Studies' warning about increased borrowing, saying the ""fundamentals"" of the economy were strong.The IFS says future public finances have deteriorated by £25bn since March.It said weak growth would lead to lower-than-expected tax receipts, increasing borrowing by £25bn by 2019-20.Asked about this by BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar, Mrs May said the government was ""determined to continue to live within our means"", adding: ""What matters is us taking the opportunities that are now open to us to develop trade around the world.""During her visit, Mrs May has faced questions about her twin goals of expanding the UK's global trade relationships after it leaves the EU while curbing migration, which the government wants to get below 100,000.On Monday she said an expansion of the Indian visa rules would be considered if Indians who overstayed their visas in the UK could be returned more swiftly and in greater numbers.Asked whether she was worried her crackdown on immigration could trigger a slowdown in trade negotiations, she said Indian businesses had told her they were keen to do business in the UK and that the Indian government wanted to ""remove the barriers to trade and investment"".Once it leaves the EU, the UK will be able to strike its own free trade deals with other countries, with the government promising to make it a ""global leader in free trade"".Such deals will involve negotiations on top of those involved with separating the UK from the EU, which are due to be triggered by the end of March 2017.Mrs May predicted these talks would be ""complex"" but said she was ""determined to grasp the opportunities for global Britain""."
2016-11-09,Scotland to intervene in Brexit case,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-37909299,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Scottish government will seek to oppose the UK government in the Supreme Court during the appeal over the triggering of Article 50.The High Court ruled last week that MPs must vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU.The UK government immediately said it would appeal to the Supreme Court, with a hearing due next month.The Lord Advocate, Scotland's most senior law officer, will now apply to be heard in the case.A spokesman for Downing Street said it would be for the courts to decide whether the intervention was granted, but insisted it would ""work very closely with all of the devolved administrations as we develop our plans for negotiating our exit from the EU.""Prime Minister Theresa May argues that the result of the EU referendum - and existing ministerial powers - means MPs do not need to vote on the triggering of Article 50.But a panel of three High Court judges agreed with campaigners that the move would be unconstitutional, and that parliament would need to vote before the formal process of leaving the EU can begin. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, believes that the consent of the Scottish Parliament and the UK's other devolved parliaments and assemblies should also be sought before Article 50 is triggered. The Scottish government had legal representatives observing the High Court case, and later said it was considering whether to become directly involved when the appeal is heard.Confirming that it would seek to intervene, Ms Sturgeon said she believed Scotland should be treated as an ""equal partner"" in the United Kingdom.If the Supreme Court was to allow the Scottish government's intervention and ruled against the UK government, it could mean there would have to be a vote on Article 50 in Holyrood as well as in Westminster.The Welsh government has also said it will seek a role in the Brexit appeal case, while the Northern Ireland Attorney General has told a court in Belfast that one of two legal challenges to Brexit should be fast-tracked directly to the Supreme Court.Ms Sturgeon stressed that she was not attempting to veto the process of England and Wales leaving the EU.But she said the ""democratic wishes of the people of Scotland and the national parliament of Scotland cannot be brushed aside as if they do not matter"".Voters taking part in June's referendum were asked the question: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" In the UK as a whole the leave campaign won by 52% to 48%, but voters going to the polls in Scotland decided by 62% to 38% to remain in the EU.Ms Sturgeon has pledged to do all she can to protect Scotland's place in Europe, and to maintain its membership of the single market. By BBC assistant political editor Norman SmithAs if Theresa May didn't have enough on her plate following last week's High Court ruling forcing the government to give MPs a say before Brexit is triggered, now the Scottish government has piled in.In effect it has said if MPs are going to be given a say, the Scottish Parliament should also have to give its approval.The difficulty for Mrs May is that she knows the Scottish Parliament is overwhelmingly opposed to Brexit and her fear will be that Nicola Sturgeon is in effect threatening to blow Brexit out of the water.Scotland's first minister insists she is not playing the veto card. She respects the right of the rest of the UK to leave the EU, but wants to protect the interests of Scotland which voted against Brexit.It may be she is simply trying to increase her leverage over Theresa May to try and secure a particular Brexit deal for Scotland - something Mrs May has already ruled out.But there is another problem and it is on delay - the danger that Brexit gets snarled up in the courts. We have already had the High Court ruling - the Supreme Court  will decide on the appeal in January - and now Scottish lawyers are piling in and the danger is the timetable of triggering Brexit by March gets put through the legal shredder.The first minister said: ""The Scottish government is clear that triggering Article 50 will directly affect devolved interests and rights in Scotland. ""And triggering Article 50 will inevitably deprive Scottish people and Scottish businesses of rights and freedoms which they currently enjoy.""It simply cannot be right that those rights can be removed by the UK government on the say-so of a prime minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent.""She also urged the prime minister to ""live up to her promise to treat Scotland as an equal partner in the United Kingdom and listen to the will of the people of Scotland"".Answering questions from journalists, the first minister was pressed on the basis on which the Scottish government will seek to involve itself in the case.She said: ""If there is a need for legislation in the House of Commons that raises the question of legislative consent, not just in the Scottish Parliament but in Wales and Northern Ireland as well.""If that is going to be an issue that the court is looking at... then it is absolutely right that the Scottish government is formally represented to make sure that the views that we would take around these processes are heard by the court.""The first minister said she would not go into the detail of what the Lord Advocate will argue, but made it clear she personally believes the UK government should seek approval for triggering Article 50 through a legislative consent motion at Holyrood.She also said she believes there are those both in the Welsh and Northern Irish governments who would take a similar view about their own parliaments.Ms Sturgeon is due to unveil proposals for a ""flexible Brexit"" - which would see Scotland remain in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves - in the coming weeks. The Supreme Court has set aside four days, from 5 until 8 December, for the appeal hearing, which will see all 11 Supreme Court justices sit on the panel.Judgment will be reserved at the conclusion of that hearing and follow at a later date, probably in the new year.All five parties in the Scottish Parliament backed remaining in the EU ahead of the referendum, but the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have warned Ms Sturgeon against using the result to push for a second vote on Scottish independence.Scottish Labour said it supported the objective of getting the ""best possible deal for Scotland"", which it said meant ""remaining part of the UK and retaining a close Scottish Greens MSP Ross Greer said it was ""reasonable that MSPs who represent the people of Scotland are consulted before any steps are taken to remove us from Europe against our wishes.""And Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie called on the prime minister to ""end all this and simply accept that there must be a democratic vote before Article 50 is invoked"".

2016-11-09,UKIP leadership: Runners and riders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37567690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUKIP is holding a fresh leadership contest after the recently-elected Diane James unexpectedly quit after 18 days in the post. Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-09,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

To get an insight into which groups actually voted for him, you can look at the exit poll conducted across the country by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.It is very difficult to get a genuinely representative sample of how more than 120 million people have voted. It is a big survey - of almost 25,000 voters - and they are the best figures available, but they should be used with caution. It throws up some odd results, such as that 10% of people who support the idea of a wall along the Mexican border nonetheless voted for Mrs Clinton, while 5% of people who thought the next president should continue the policies of Barack Obama voted for Mr Trump. Bear in mind that the proportions are unlikely to add up to 100%, because not everybody answered all the questions and there were other candidates standing in the election, who received about 5% of the votes.The poll suggests that 53% of men voted for Mr Trump, with 41% voting for Mrs Clinton - those proportions are almost exactly reversed for women.Among white voters (who made up 70% of voters), Mr Trump won 58% to Mrs Clinton's 37%, while the Democratic candidate won the support of a huge majority of black voters - 88% to Mr Trump's 8% - and Hispanic voters - 65% to his 29%.Looking specifically at white women, they favoured Mr Trump, with 53% supporting him compared with 43% for Mrs Clinton. It has been widely reported that the 29% of Hispanic voters who supported Mr Trump was greater than the 27% who voted for the Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, despite Mr Trump's comments about Mexicans and plans to build a wall on the US's southern border.Mrs Clinton had the majority of voters on lower incomes, with 52% of those on incomes below $50,000 (£40,000) a year supporting her compared with 41% voting for her opponent. Among those earning more than $50,000, it was 49% to Mr Trump compared with 47% to Mrs Clinton.Mrs Clinton's support among those on incomes below $30,000 was well down on President Obama's in 2012. He had 63% support from that group compared with 35% voting for Mitt Romney, while Mrs Clinton had 53% support to Mr Trump's 41%.There was also a big swing for voters without a high school diploma, with Mr Trump leading 51% to Mrs Clinton's 45%. Four years ago, President Obama had 64% support from this group compared with Mitt Romney's 35%.Mr Trump won the rural vote by 62% to 34% and the suburban vote by 50% to 45%, while Mrs Clinton won the urban vote by 59% to 35%.And he had a clear majority among those aged 45 and over, while Mrs Clinton was more popular with younger voters.There were stories before the election of Republicans planning to vote for Mrs Clinton because they did not like their own candidate, but the exit poll actually suggested that 7% of people who identified themselves as Republicans had voted for Mrs Clinton, while 9% of those who identified as Democrats had voted for Mr Trump.Of people who gave their opinion of the candidate they voted for, 41% strongly favoured them, 32% had reservations and 25% said they disliked the opponents.Also among the slightly odd findings of the poll, 18% of respondents who felt that Mr Trump was not qualified to be president nonetheless voted for him, as did 20% of those who felt he did not have the necessary temperament.And 2% of respondents who said they would feel scared if Mr Trump won, still voted for him, compared with 1% who voted for Mrs Clinton, despite saying they would be scared if she won."

But what plans has the UK got in place and what could it mean for its position in the world?It is 20 January 2017 and a cold wind is blowing across Washington's Capitol as Donald John Trump raises his right hand and proclaims that he will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States.As he looks the chief justice in the eye, hundreds of millions of people around the world are wondering what his four-year term will bring.Among them are UK civil servants and politicians, pondering - with negotiations for leaving the European Union also soon to begin - what all this means for their country.So, how well prepared is the UK for dealing with Mr Trump, who has never previously held elected office, and how is the future looking?The UK and US share a language and much cultural heritage, but, argues Tim Oliver, a fellow in European-North American relations at the London School of Economics, the truly ""special"" quality in their relationship is the sharing of intelligence, as well as co-operation over nuclear weapons and special forces.Mr Oliver says there is a risk this could ""sour"" because of the ""degree of distrust and unease"" felt by the government towards Mr Trump, ""an erratic president who appears willing to do anything when it comes to torture, bombing, relations with authoritarian states"".Critics accuse Mr Trump of isolationism, but he describes his foreign policy stance as one of ""Americanism, not globalism"". He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.The UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?""A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,"" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. ""But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.""Before the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to ""the back of the queue"" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.His trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he ""absolutely"" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.""I could see that happening,"" says Ms Schake, ""especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  ""A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.""Mr Trump's election website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.Theresa May did not offer an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".Asked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: ""I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.""The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,"" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.Tony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. More trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party, fresh from an unexpected victory over Labour, helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.The problem is, Ms Schake argues, that ""Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding"", adding: ""But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.""Personal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.""Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,"" said Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government, her comments coming before the US voted.""Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.""I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?""Many mainstream Republicans criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush and Mr McCain.We know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, will be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr Trump is a famous man, with a long career in business and a stint in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many ""known unknowns"", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.Another complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.Then, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with ""unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next"".""I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,"" said Ms Rutter.""If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.""Well, that's started."

Ban cats from going outdoors. Bring back fish and chips wrapped in newspaper.These are three demands - all rejected -  from users of the government's e-petitions service.Petitions gaining more than 100,000 signatures can be considered for a debate in parliament. While some petitions - like Jamie Oliver's petition to tax sugary drinks - can make it all the way into law, others aren't quite so successful. But what the Petitions Committee gives to Jamie Oliver, it takes away from may others, rejecting petitions that fall foul of its standards - set out in full here. Here's a quick run through some of the most common reasons petitions never make it:The Petitions Committee can't nominate someone for an honour - there's already a system in place for members of the public to nominate people directly.There's hope for some petitioners though - this petition calling for police horses and dogs to be given the same legal protections as their human colleagues will be debated in parliament's Westminster Hall on 14 November. The most popular e-petitions ever cover some slightly less unusual subjects.The petition with the most signatures - over four million of them - called on the government to hold a second EU membership referendum if either Leave or Remain were backed by less than 60% of voters and saw a turnout of less than 75%.The petition, which attracted a flood of signatures after June's Brexit vote, was debated in September, but there's been no sign of another referendum. Another petition that gained widespread attention was a call for parliament to ban Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from entering the UK. It was debated in January 2016. Mr Trump remains free to visit Britain.Despite these petitions successfully making it into the debating chamber, one member of the public felt Parliament would be better off without having to talk about them:"
2016-11-09,Friendly smiles,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37896976,"If Theresa May was seeking to ramp up UK-India trade in smiles, salutes and friendly rhetoric, she'd have a world class deal already.The prime minister shared a long lunch, a long chat and two public platforms with her Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in New Delhi and she's sure to spend more time in future cultivating a personal and economic relationship she sees as vital to British prosperity after Brexit.But sealing a comprehensive trade deal demands more than smiles and salutes.India wants more visas for students and workers. Theresa May has shown no inclination to offer any broad commitment to a more liberal approach to Indian migration.There is no cap on visa numbers. The official UK line is Britain's doors are open to the ""brightest and the best"". Yet the UK is widely seen in India as wanting ""free trade in everything except people"".And Mrs May's anxiety to reduce net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands is well-known and frequently stated.Today the prime minister promised to allow Indian travellers, maybe 10,000 over the coming two years, to pass UK immigration more easily at ports and airports - as easily as UK travellers. Successful high value travellers, of the kind most countries are keen to welcome, would have extra help and advice for their families and themselves.However, Mrs May also wants India to do more to facilitate the return of Indians who have overstayed their legal limit in the UK. That might mean more effort approving the documentation needed to return an overstayer home.Again, the British desire to bear down on net migration lies at the root of a tension in relations between the two countries.If Britain is going to make a success of Brexit in the broadest sense, it is vital to cultivate India, a trade market which has shrunk even as the Indian economy has grown. The political obstacles at home on the road to Brexit have yet to be negotiated. The challenges beyond already look daunting.Swashbuckling, dashing, gloriously reckless. Just a few of the epithets you'll never, ever, see applied to Theresa May. Yet it's hard to think of anyone who's had a more successful few months in today's politics. If she was a cricketer, she'd be Geoffrey Boycott.And if the Yorkshire and England cricket legend was here in New Delhi, he'd probably sing her praises. Which, as it happens, he is and he did.""She'll be like Margaret Thatcher,"" he told an admiring gaggle of cricket-loving journos who spotted him the the Taj Palace Hotel.""She's good. She doesn't need my advice. She's got a few more strokes than me.""""She has views and she's strong. Life is about integrity and principles - it should be. We want politicians like that with integrity, with principles, with honesty.""As any Test Match Special listener could tell you, when Geoffrey likes someone, he says so. And generally doesn't stop.

2016-11-09,Time to talk,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37845980,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkWhen proposing new laws, ministers can fill the statute books from the relative safety of their positions in government. But for the average backbench MP, the chance to make laws can seem a distant possibility.Their best chance comes around once a year, in the form of a random ballot.The prize? A chance for MPs to promote their pet project in the House of Commons by introducing it as a Private Members' Bill.Private Members' Bills can be introduced in three different ways. The first are ""Ten Minute Rule"" bills, where MPs make a speech of no more than 10 minutes to outline their position. Second are presentations to the Commons, where an MP might formally introduce the title of their bill.The third and most likely to make it onto the statute book are the ""Ballot Bills"", so-called because MPs take part in a random draw to decide who gets to propose a bill in the Commons. The system has its critics, among them the SNP MP who sponsored the ""Turing Bill"" to pardon gay men for obsolete sexual offences.""It is absurd for legislation to be decided by the deputy speaker pulling balls out of a jar. It seems altogether too random,"" John Nicolson says.If this sounds confusing, it's probably because it is.In a report on Private Members' Bills, the Commons' Procedure Committee called the process ""impenetrable"" and ""enormously damaging to the reputation of the House and to the legislative process"".Chairman of the committee, Broxbourne MP Charles Walker, says: ""One thing you have to do in this house is accept failure, but you need to have a fair crack at failure, and I don't think most backbenchers now have a fair crack at failure.""Even if an MP is lucky enough to propose their Private Members' Bill to the Commons, it is far from guaranteed that it will become law. Opposing MPs can stop these sorts of bills progressing by ""filibustering"" or ""talking them out"" during debates held on 13 Fridays throughout the year - a process the Procedure Committee report describes as ""speaking at inordinate length on the bill to ensure that the debate cannot conclude"" before the set time limit. Mr Nicolson's Private Members' Bill, the Sexual Offences (Pardons) Bill, fell after a government minister used up the time allotted for debating it by speaking for 25 minutes. There were cries of ""shame"" and ""shameful"" from some MPs as Justice Minister Sam Gyimah's speech brought the debate to a close.Speaking to the BBC Mr Nicolson said: ""I think voters consider filibustering to be wrong. And I agree with them. ""Filibustering is archaic, and often used to frustrate the Private Members' Bill process. If a minister doesn't talk out a bill, a hard core of obstructionist MPs often do it, talking nonsensically for lengthy periods until the time allocated for the bill is over."" Mr Gyimah defended his opposition to Mr Nicolson's bill, saying ""I understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson's bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences.""Conservative MP Philip Davies, a regular attendee of Friday debates on Private Members' Bills, mounted a passionate defence of talking out. Speaking to a Procedure Committee evidence session Mr Davies said: ""I support a bill by not speaking at all, and stop a bad bill from going forward by running out of time.""If the purpose of me contributing to the debate is to try to stop bills that I think are bad, this is the mechanism that I have to use, under the rules,"" he continued.""If there was another mechanism of blocking them that didn't involve me speaking in the debate, the chances are that I would use that mechanism and therefore nobody would hear another point of view. You would only hear one side.""Mr Davies concluded: ""When we have a debate, whether people like the outcome or not, at least people get to hear that there is a different opinion on a particular bill.""Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had a similar experience of a bill being talked out in 2015. Her ""NHS Reinstatement"" bill ran out of time after MPs spent four-and-a-half hours debating the two-clause Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) bill. Ms Lucas told the Procedure Committee the bill was one that ""certain MPs have 'on the shelf' for the purpose of clogging up Private Members' Bill time on Fridays"". The Brighton Pavilion MP told the BBC: ""What really turns the public off politics is witnessing the childish way some MPs speak for a huge amount of time in order to 'talk out' bills and prevent them from being concluded and voted on.""While talking out has many opponents, there are ways of clamping down on the practice that already exist.In its recommendations for changes to the Private Members' Bill process, the Procedure Committee suggested that the Speaker and his deputies overseeing debates on them should make greater use of their existing ability to impose time limits on speeches.Equally, an MP sponsoring a Private Members' Bill can attempt to close a debate before it runs out of time. The problem is that to do so 100 MPs have to be present in the chamber - a requirement the committee's report called a ""a formidable hurdle"" to overcome on Fridays, when many MPs have already returned to their constituencies. In the end, opponents of talking out may be disappointed, because the Procedure Committee stopped short of calling for a ban.Warning against applying more rules to Commons debates, the committee instead suggested limiting opportunities to indulge in the practice.""The more rules there are, the greater the opportunities to game them,"" it said."
2016-11-09,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161110005652/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37897476,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAs Prime Minister Theresa May leads a trade mission to India, there has been discussion about how students are treated in migration figures.Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria told BBC News: ""We need to immediately get the government, Theresa May, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures'.""Students are currently included in the official net migration figures that are estimated by the Office for National Statistics.It published a document earlier this year about the treatment of students in the statistics.The net migration figures are based on the International Passenger Survey, which asks people at UK ports whether they are planning to stay or leave for at least 12 months. Including students is standard practice. If all the international students who came to study for more than a year left again at the end of their courses then, over time, they would have no impact on net migration figures. If the way the figures are collected was perfect (which it is not - it is a survey) then they would be counted in at the start of their courses and counted out at the end of them.Removing students from the net migration figures would reduce them considerably for three or four years, but have no impact after that.But the reason that the statisticians keep students in the net migration figures is that there is a gap between the numbers arriving and the numbers leaving.In the year to the end of June 2015, 184,000 students came to the UK planning to stay for at least a year, while 57,000 students who had started courses in previous years left.The ONS said that gap had been fairly consistent since 2012, when it started collecting figures in this way.That gap makes a big difference to the net migration figures - it's a gap of 127,000 a period when total net migration to the UK was 336,000.Some of this gap could be down to the imperfections in the International Passenger Survey, which is a big survey, interviewing 700,000 to 800,000 people a year, but is still a survey and hence only an estimate. And there are particular problems with sampling students, for example, somebody doing a master's degree may say on arrival that they are planning to stay for a year but then leave after 11 months, meaning that they would be counted as a long-term migrant as they arrived but not as they left.Some of the gap will be down to people who have extended their visas or obtained new ones, having started new courses or found skilled work, for example.And there will be people who have finished their courses and outstayed their visas.To get an idea of how many people are extending their student visas, the Home Office says that in 2014, 75,000 people were granted an extension of stay in the UK to study, of whom 12,000 had previously been on non-study visas. That figure for extensions was relatively low, having averaged 127,000 over the previous three years.Lord Bilimoria said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years.It has actually fallen by more than that, with 68,238 study visas issued to Indian nationals in the year to June 2010, falling to 11,864 five years later, according to official figures.The rules have indeed been tightened, with students from outside the EU wanting to extend their study visas, for example, having to do so from outside the UK and visas no longer allowing students to seek work in the UK after graduation.Nonetheless, over that same period, the number of students coming from China to the UK rose from 39,695 to 68,294.

And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Mr Hammond said it was important for the UK to tap into the Chinese market, with the country's middle class population expected to reach 600 million in the next few years.He added: ""Our trade relationship with China is now more important than ever.""Mr Ma said: ""China wishes to see a UK and Europe that encourage stability and high prosperity. China will be happy to see the UK and Europe reach a win-win relationship through negotiation.""US President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to apply 45% tariff barriers to Chinese imports in an effort to protect free trade.But Mr Hammond told the BBC: ""Britain's always believed that the best way long-term to protect and promote prosperity is free markets and free trade. ""President Trump has just been elected by the American people. He will want to consult with his advisers, talk to officials and I'm sure we will have a very constructive dialogue, as we do with the Chinese, with the new American administration.""He added: ""It's about getting the right balance in the global trading system, so that we can have the benefits of open markets, while being properly and appropriately protected.""One of Theresa May's first acts on becoming prime minister during the summer was to order a review of the project to build Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, part-financed by China.Writing in the Financial Times in August, Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said: ""If Britain's openness is a condition for bilateral co-operation, then mutual trust is the very foundation on which this is built.""Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more.""The UK government approved Hinkley Point C in September, saying it had imposed ""significant new safeguards"" to protect national security.After the London meeting, Mr Hammond said the deal would attract £6bn of investment to the UK, and Mr Ma described giving the go-ahead for the project as a ""big encouragement"" to further trade ties.

Asked about the Republican's unexpected election victory against Democrat Hillary Clinton, UKIP's interim leader - in place following the resignation of his successor, Diane James - said he ""couldn't be happier"".He described the result as ""Brexit times two"", adding of his own role in events: ""I'm the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites and all these dreadful people who, working hand-in-glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, have made themselves rich and ruined our countries.""He claimed Mr Trump, who will be inaugurated in January, ""hates the EU even more than I do"" and predicted an improvement in US-UK relations, saying: ""That Obama creature, loathsome individual, couldn't stand our country. He said we'd be at the back of the queue [for trade deals], didn't he?""What was interesting was that Trump said we'd be at the front of the queue.""Mr Farage said it was unlikely the US president-elect would take him on as an adviser, as he was not an American citizen, but told Talk Radio: ""I will be encouraging him to make the United Kingdom his number one global priority.""During the election campaign, a 2005 recording of Mr Trump apparently bragging about groping women was released. This prompted many senior Republicans to abandon support for him.Promising to give Mr Trump ""a drill on British etiquette"", Mr Farage joked: ""I'm now going to become a diplomat. I've got to say, 'Come and schmooze Theresa - don't touch her, for goodness' sake'."" He added: ""If it comes to it, I could be there as the responsible adult, make sure everything's OK.""Meanwhile, UKIP MEP William Dartmouth called Mr Farage the ""best choice"" for the next UK ambassador to Washington.He said: ""On Brexit, the special relationship will be even more important. Nigel Farage already has good ties and a relationship with the US President-elect, Donald Trump - much better than anyone else in British public life. ""His appointment would  materially assist the UK in getting a UK-USA trade agreement for the first time. We in the UK would then  be 'at the front of the queue'."" "

Nicola Sturgeon released a statement congratulating Mr Trump after his surprise victory in the US election.But speaking at First Minister's Questions the following day, she made clear that she stood by her previous criticisms of his campaign. Ms Sturgeon had backed Hillary Clinton ahead of the presidential election. The first minister told MSPs she had faced criticism for breaking the convention that political leaders do not comment on election campaigns in other countries. But she said many of Mr Trump's comments during the campaign had been ""deeply abhorrent"". She said: ""I never want to be, I am not prepared to be, a politician that maintains a diplomatic silence in the face of attitudes of racism, sexism, misogyny or intolerance of any kind.""I hope that president-elect Trump turns out to be a president very different to the kind of candidate he was and reaches out to those who felt vilified by his campaign.""But people of progressive opinion the world over, I think, do have to stand up for the values of tolerance and respect for diversity and difference.""Ms Sturgeon added that she wanted to ""engage positively and constructively with the American administration"", but would ""never shy away from standing up for these important principles"".The first minister also said the Scottish government will fully assess the potential impact for Scotland once the new president forms an administration and its priorities are made clear.Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said Mr Trump's behaviour towards women had sent a ""dangerous signal across the world"".She added: ""In January we will have a misogynist in the White House who has boasted about assaulting women and has used the most degrading language possible.""And, of course, Donald Trump's tolerance is not just aimed at women - we all remember the sickening sight of him mocking a disabled journalist. We can't forget his plans to build a wall or ban people of one faith from entering America.""Mr Trump, whose mother was Scottish, has had an uneasy relationship with the country in recent years.Ms Sturgeon stripped him of his role as a business ambassador for the Scottish government in the wake of his call for Muslims not to be allowed into the US.Mr Trump also had a high-profile war of words with Ms Sturgeon's predecessor, Alex Salmond, over the Scottish government's backing for a windfarm near the tycoon's Aberdeenshire golf course."
2016-11-10,Ways Trump's victory might affect the UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37920142,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link He's only gone and done it. Donald Trump has won the US election. So what might his presidency mean for the UK?Part of what has made Donald Trump attractive to voters - a Washington outsider with no political past - is what makes him such an unpredictable factor for the financial world, and its knock-on effects for Britain. The UK, European and Asian markets initially fell on news of America's seismic election result. Many markets then largely recovered. But how far the uncertainty and instability plays out, and what effect that has on, say, UK interest rates, depends on how long global markets stay ""surprised"", says Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management. If UK stock markets, business and consumer confidence were to be dragged down for weeks or even months the Bank of England could move back from its current ""neutral"" position on interest rates, she says, to a ""loosening bias"" - giving a signal to markets that it expects its next move to be a further small cut in interest rates.""But if markets settle as quickly as they have on Wednesday, the Bank of England may decide to hold rates at their current level. And what of the pound? On Wednesday morning, sterling strengthened against the dollar, rising 0.3% to go back above $1.24. Then it promptly fell back to where it had started the day. But in the longer term? The euro also strengthened in early trading, up 0.4% higher against the dollar. But the pound is still a long way beneath where it was before the Brexit vote.""That downward move reflects the fact that markets believe the UK's long-term growth prospects will be weaker following our departure from the EU, and concerns about what our future trade relationships with EU and other economies may be,"" says Ms O'Carroll.""These concerns will remain in play, and are not really affected by Mr Trump's victory.""Prospects are still more about ""the local shock of Brexit"" than what happened across the pond. In victory, Donald Trump's speech struck an unfamiliar, conciliatory tone. He set out his vision for America at home and also pledged to ""get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us"". ""We expect to have great, great relationships,"" he said.Of course, for him, US interests come first. But he said his country would ""deal fairly with everyone"". He added: ""All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict.""UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""looking forward to working"" with him, in a strong ""trade, security and defence"" partnership.  The American Ambassador to the UK , Matthew Barzun, assured the special relationship, as his boss Barack Obama had put it, stayed ""unbreakable and unshakeable"". It's a far cry from the time that Mrs May called the then candidate's comments on Muslims ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"". Or Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's riposte to comments about London's supposed ""radicalisation"" that he wouldn't visit New York due to the ""real risk of meeting Donald Trump"". He now is ""looking forward to working with (Mr Trump) on global stability and prosperity"".Much of Donald Trump's previous dealings in the UK have revolved around his controversial development of a golf course in Aberdeenshire, very much pre-presidency.He has held no political office, forged no foreign policy path, so the impact on military, intelligence, and other shared interests of his campaign vision of ""peace through strength"" is unclear.A huge part of that relationship with the UK and the world is based in trade. Pre-EU referendum, President Obama warned the UK would go to the ""back of the queue"" for a US trade deal if it voted out. The Trump camp is more positive. Trade adviser Dan DiMicco said he ""absolutely"" wanted to strike a trade deal with the UK. Trump himself said it made ""no difference"" if the UK was in the EU or not.His website, however, doesn't mention the UK in its section on trade, instead focusing on the problems he sees in the US relationship with China.China and the US have driven global growth during the past quarter of a century. But the president-elect feels relations between the two are unfairly skewed towards China. He wants it labelled a ""currency manipulator"". And has threatened to tear up global trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the aim of securing a better deal for American workers. That would be a move ""many believe will be bad for global economic growth"", says the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed, with knock-on effects for the UK economy. ""We are also in the middle of the biggest, untested monetary experiment ever attempted by central banks following the financial crisis - $12.3 trillion of quantitative easing or money printing to stop the world lurching into deep recession.""Investors and markets are no longer sure which way is up.""One of the first clues on how Donald Trump may operate in office, compared with what he said as a candidate could come in how he deals with US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.  Her term is due to come to an end in 2018 - she is seen by many as a positive influence for stability. But the president-elect has accused the independent central bank of keeping interest rates low at Democrat President Obama's behest. And what he does next may set some of the tone for his financial policy.There has not yet been a plunge in the dollar that would make the US suddenly more attractive for tourists. But on the less tangible side, does a trip to the US feel less or more appealing? ""Emotionally, the effects are less easy to predict. The welcoming people, Florida theme parks, New York streets, National Park wildernesses and California sunshine will remain the same,"" travel writer Simon Calder says,""But during the campaign Donald Trump invoked fear and hate, and America may feel more divided than it has done since the Vietnam War, with abundant mutual suspicion and distrust.""Longer term, reaching the US could get more difficult, with your faith possibly determining how easy it is to get through passport control,"" he says, referring to Donald Trump's December 2015 call for ""a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". ""Politically that may be impossible to impose, in which case there may well be much stricter controls on every foreign visitor - which will appal states such as Florida that are dependent on tourism.""

2016-11-10,TB badger cull call by vets' leader,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-37938945,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkBadger culling over wide areas is needed as part of the fight against TB in cattle, a leading vet has said.Ministers have ruled out the idea, unveiling new plans which focused on better testing of cattle and limited badger culls on individual farms.  Dr Neil Paton of the British Veterinary Association (BVA) told AMs that wildlife was ""left uncontrolled"".The Welsh Government said its current approach was proving effective, with a downward trend in new TB incidents. The climate change, environment and rural affairs committee has been taking evidence on the Welsh Government's new strategy for tackling bovine TB, currently open to consultation.The aim is to eradicate the disease in high risk areas such as south west Wales and the border with England, and prevent it spreading to north west Wales. The Welsh Government has repeatedly resisted calls for widespread culling of badgers, a policy which has proved controversial in England.  Rural Affairs Secretary Lesley Griffiths has said she would consider allowing the cage-trapping of badgers and the humane killing of infected animals if they were found to be part of the problem on individual farms.But Dr Paton, president of the BVA in Wales, told AMs on Thursday: ""What make a cull effective is sufficient number of badgers killed in sufficient time over a sufficiently large area.""He called for culling areas of at least 150 sq km (58 sq miles), with ""hard borders"" such as rivers and major roads which would contain the targeted badgers.Ogmore Labour AM Huw Irranca-Davies asked about the need for badger culls if bovine TB infection was mostly from cattle to cattle. Dr Paton said there would always be a ""re-infection pressure"" from wildlife.""There is 50 percent cattle-to-cattle transmission - I'm not going to argue with that number - but where that originates from is typically from introduction from another source, and some of that source is wildlife.  ""Once one cow is infected within a herd, then it spreads potentially rapidly.""So unless you've dealt with the wildlife as part of your overall control strategy, then you are not going to get eradication.""   Dr Paton stressed the BVA's preference for humanely trapping and shooting infected badgers, rejecting the free shooting policy that had been used in England as inhumane and ineffective.Conservative rural affairs spokesman Paul Davies said: ""There is a clear requirement for a more holistic approach and the Welsh Government's strategy should include all the tools at its disposal to ensure we eliminate Bovine TB in both our cattle and wildlife population.""James Byrne from Wildlife Trusts Wales said his organisation was ""conscious of the hardship"" that bovine TB causes in the farming community.But he added: ""The scientific evidence demonstrates that culling is likely to be ineffective in fighting the disease and, worse still, risks making the problem even worse.""""The emphasis of all our efforts should be to find a long-term solution, based on good science,"" he added.A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Our refreshed approach to TB eradication will continue to focus on all sources of infection. ""However, cattle control measures continue to be the main focus of the programme as this approach is proving to be effective, with a downward trend in new TB incidents. ""A consultation on the refreshed programme is underway and the cabinet secretary has invited people to have their say on the proposals."""

""Britain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise.""We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence. ""I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.""In December 2015 she criticised the Republican's call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, saying it was ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".At the time Mrs May, who was then home secretary, also said Mr Trump's remark that police were afraid to enter some parts of London because of radicalisation was ""nonsense"", saying: ""I just think it shows he does not understand the UK and what happens in the UK.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted his congratulations to Mr Trump and said he was ""much looking forward to working with his administration on global stability and prosperity"".Like Mrs May, he has previously attacked Mr Trump's comments about London, saying that ""the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump"".Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's victory was ""a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened"".He added: ""And the public anger that has propelled Donald Trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world.""The Labour leader also said Mr Trump's campaign had been ""nasty and divisive"" and that he looked forward to ""robust discussions"" with the president-elect about climate change and the importance of the United Nations.Ms Sturgeon congratulated Mr Trump but said his victory was not the outcome she had hoped for, adding: ""I hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America.""Her predecessor Alex Salmond said Mr Trump - who has extensive business interests in Scotland - said the President-elect was a ""protectionist"" when it came to trade but he hoped that his views would change in the White House.""The difficulty with Donald Trump is not when he's winning, it's when he's not getting his own way,"" he said.""He's nice as nine pence when he's getting his own way. It's what happens when he reaches road blocks, obstacles, when somebody says no to him... In these circumstances we'd better all just hope that the Presidency changes a man."" Mr Trump was criticised by a number of UK MPs during the campaign, including during a Commons debate in January on banning him from the country.As Westminster reacted to his victory, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the values of ""moderation, freedom, respect for the rule of law, openness and concern for one another"" had been defeated, while Green Party joint leader Caroline Lucas said it was ""a devastating day"".However, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant highlighted Mr Trump's reported enthusiasm for a trade deal with the UK, comparing this with the outgoing president's ""back of the queue"" comment.Mr Farage, who joined Mr Trump on stage during the campaign, congratulated him on his ""brave"" campaign.""We now have a President who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values,"" he said. ""Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives.""Steve Hilton, a former adviser to David Cameron in Downing Street, said the Republican tycoon won because Americans could see in him ""someone who might make a difference to their lives"".Sir Peter Westmacott, who was UK Ambassador to the US until earlier this year, said Mr Trump had been a ""law until himself"" during the campaign and it was not clear who would form his foreign policy team.While there were significant policy differences that would need to be ""ironed out"", he told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the UK's relationship with the US was strong and it was natural for Mrs May to want a ""fresh start"" following Trump's election.

2016-11-10,Apprenticeships 'don't meet teen needs',https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-37924127,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkToo many apprenticeships in England do not help teenagers start a career or progress to higher vocational education, research suggests.The Institute for Public Policy Research wants lower level apprenticeships replaced by a pre-apprenticeship programme addressing 16- to 18-year-olds' ""distinct needs"".Its report comes as universities are awarded £4.5m to develop 5,200 degree level apprenticeships from September.Ministers said ""apprenticeships work"".Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said apprenticeship programmes and traineeships were part of the government's strategy to ensure that people of all backgrounds and all ages ""can get on the ladder of opportunity"". He said that the existing apprenticeship programme for 16- to 18-year olds would boost participants' earnings, ""by up to £74,000 more over their lifetime, thanks to the skills they gain"". He also argued that degree apprenticeships would ""give people a real chance to earn while you learn putting you on the fast-track to a top career"".Degree apprentice courses will include nursing, construction, cybersecurity, food manufacturing, health care science and early years teaching.The IPPR report says level-two apprenticeships for younger learners ""are often very job specific, do not include much off the job training, and from next year they will not be required to include a recognised qualification"". ""These sort of training programmes may make sense for adults who are already in work and looking to 'top up' their skills - however, they are not sufficient to help young people with relatively low levels of education get a foot on the career ladder,"" it says.The research suggests a pre-apprenticeship programme be designed to ""address explicitly the distinct needs of younger learners"", with more ""off the job training"" and general education.It suggests pre-apprenticeships be offered by further education colleges only, targeted at young people under the age of 18 and explicitly designed to help them move on to a level-three apprenticeship at the age of 18 or 19.The scheme would also offer employers a subsidy they could use to cover a youngster's wages.Clare McNeil, IPPR associate director for work and families, said: ""Young people often struggle to make the transition from education to work.""Our apprenticeship system is failing too many young people. It is just not giving them the opportunity they need to build a successful career, and to make the most of their talents.  ""Britain can't afford to waste young people's talents like this anymore.""Our system needs to help business and training providers to work together to deliver radically better training for these young people, learning from the best systems around the world.""David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said: ""The AoC has been calling for the introduction of a pre-apprenticeship offer for some time, so it's good to see other organisations pushing for the same idea, even if we probably need to debate the level at which that is delivered.""In March, the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the government's apprenticeships drive was failing to deliver for young people in England."

'Race' needs to be explicitly back on the agenda.""They recommended updated advice for schools, more training for teachers and better recording of incidents of bullying and harassment to tackle the problem."
2016-11-10,Families win against housing benefit cut,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37921766,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA woman who has spina bifida and a couple who look after their severely-disabled grandson have won their Supreme Court appeals against the so-called ""bedroom tax"".The court ruled that the government's changes to housing benefit discriminated against them.But five other people had similar challenges dismissed by the court.The court said councils should be able to decide which tenants were given discretionary payments to help them.Disability campaigners have been protesting against the system, which removed subsidies for social housing tenants who were deemed to have ""spare"" rooms in their homes, since it was introduced by the government in 2013.Dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour, tenants affected had payments cut by 14% for one spare bedroom and 25% for two or more spare bedrooms.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had argued that it had given councils money to make discretionary payments to people facing hardship because of the policy change.Welcoming the ruling, a DWP spokesman said: ""In most cases, local authorities are best placed to understand the needs of their residents."" Delivering the judgement on Wednesday, Lord Toulson said the judges had unanimously agreed that the claim the benefit change had discriminated against disabled people was ""too broad"".He said: ""There is a line to be drawn between on the one hand those who have a medical need for an additional bedroom and on the other hand, those who do not have a direct medical need for an additional room but may have powerful reasons for staying where they are, because of their particular personal circumstances.""For spina bifida patient Jacqueline Carmichael, 44, from Southport, Merseyside, the need for an extra bedroom was medical, he said, with judges unanimously ruling that ""the scheme in relation to her is discriminatory"".Her condition means she has to sleep in a hospital bed in a fixed position. There is not enough space for a second bed so her husband Jayson sleeps in a separate bedroom. Mr Carmichael brought the court challenge along with four others after suffering defeat at both the High Court and Court of Appeal in January.Outside the court on Wednesday, he said he hoped their victory would help others.He said: ""It's put a dent in this undemocratic policy which was never, never voted, never in any party's manifesto in the first place, the 'bedroom tax'.  ""We are pleased now, we hope Theresa May will look at the policy again so that, so that it will take into consideration a lot of people's personal circumstances, which it hasn't in the past.""The court also ruled in favour of Pembrokeshire couple Paul and Susan Rutherford and their 15-year-old grandson Warren. Their case focused on the impact of the policy on disabled children needing overnight care. Speaking outside the court, Mr Rutherford said: ""It's probably the best day we've had in the last three-and-a-half years and we're just really glad that it's all over.  ""Glad that we've won for everybody else who's in our situation, because there's quite a few out there who are.""  However, the judges rejected the cases of five others who have had their housing benefit reduced as a result of the government's changes. They are:The solicitor for the woman known as ""A"" said her client intended to challenge the ruling in the European Court of Human Rights, for the breach of her rights and ""other vulnerable women whose lives are at risk"".Rebekah Carrier, at Hopkin Murray Beskine solicitors, added: ""Although we welcome today's ruling that A must continue to receive Sanctuary Scheme protection for as long as she needs it, we are disappointed and frankly baffled by the majority's finding that there is no need to formally exempt Sanctuary Scheme users from the effects of the bedroom tax.""Lord Toulson said there was ""no dispute"" that A needed protection under the government's Sanctuary Scheme. However, he said that her property, which has been adapted, was larger than she needed and she did not necessarily need to stay in it.The government argues that the benefit changes encourage people to move to smaller properties and saves about £480m a year from the housing benefit bill.A DWP spokesman said: ""It is welcome that the court found in our favour in five out of the seven cases. ""The court also agreed with our view that discretionary housing payments are generally an appropriate and lawful way to provide assistance to those who need extra help.  In the two specific cases where the court did not find in our favour, we will take steps to ensure we comply with the judgement in due course."""
2016-11-10,Sturgeon congratulates Trump on victory,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37916648,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkScotland's first minister has congratulated Donald Trump on his surprise election win despite admitting it was ""not the outcome I wanted"". Nicola Sturgeon publicly backed Hillary Clinton ahead of the presidential vote. But she said the result of the election should be respected, and that Scotland valued its relationship with the US. Ms Sturgeon removed Mr Trump from a list of Scottish business ambassadors when he suggested Muslims would be stopped from entering the US. Her predecessor as first minister, Alex Salmond, has previously backed calls for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK.Mr Trump is to become the 45th US president after a stunning victory over Mrs Clinton, the Democrat candidate.The Republican nominee's victory came down to a handful of key swing states, despite months of polling that favoured Mrs Clinton.As he addressed supporters at a victory rally in New York, Mr Trump said it was ""time for us to come together as one united people"".President-elect Trump's mother, Mary MacLeod, was born in the village of Tong on Lewis in the Western Isles in 1912.She left the island at the age of 18 for a holiday in New York, where she met and later married local builder Fred Trump.Their son Donald spoke of his late mother's Scottish heritage in 2006 when he bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, turning it into a golf resort against the wishes of local residents.In April 2014, the 70-year-old US tycoon also purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire.Mr Trump also unsuccessfully challenged Scottish government ministers in court over their decision to approve an offshore wind farm near his Aberdeenshire golf course. Responding to the result, Ms Sturgeon said: ""While this is not the outcome I hoped for, it is the verdict of the American people and we must respect it. I congratulate President-Elect Trump on winning the election.""We value our relationship with the United States and its people. The ties that bind Scotland and the US - of family, culture and business - are deep and longstanding and they will always endure.""Ms Sturgeon said the result had left many people in the US and across the world with a ""real sense of anxiety"".She added: ""I hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalized by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America.""Today must also be a moment for those who share progressive values - all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity - to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold dear.""The first minister also paid tribute to Mrs Clinton, saying her candidacy had represented a ""major step forward for women in America and across the world"".Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland she did not regret backing Mrs Clinton during the election, calling some of Mr Trump's comments during the campaign ""undoubtedly racist"".She added: ""The comments made during the campaign were deeply offensive to many different groups in society and there's a need now and a big responsibility on his shoulders to bring people together.""I'm never going to shy away from my believe in articulating principles of tolerance and respect and diversity and multiculturalism.""The relationship between Scotland and America is an important one, and I'm not going to, because of my own personal views, risk the interests of Scotland by not engaging with the American government. But the nature of that engagement will depend to some extent on how Donald Trump conducts himself as President.""UK Prime Minister Theresa May has also congratulated Mr Trump on his election as US president, and said Britain and America would remain ""strong and close partners"".But several Scottish political figures have expressed their shock and disappointment over Mr Trump's victory. Mr Salmond, who is now the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, said his own disappointment at the result was ""as of nothing"" compared to the people, religions and racial minorities who had been ""demeaned and insulted by Donald Trump"" during the campaign.The former first minister added: ""The difficulty with Donald Trump is not when he's winning, it's not when he's getting his own way, he's nice as ninepence when he's getting his own way.""It's what happens when he reaches road blocks, obstacles, when somebody says no to him. In these circumstances we'd better all just hope that the presidency changes a man."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said it was not the result she wanted, and expressed her hope that ""President Trump turns out to be a different man to candidate Trump"".Her Scottish Labour counterpart, Kezia Dugdale, said it was a ""dark day"" and accused Mr Trump of running a ""hate-filled campaign that was dominated by lies, misogyny and racism"". Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie called on the Scottish government to shun Mr Trump, who Mr Harvie described as a ""racist, sexist bully"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the UK should use its ""special relationship"" with the US to ""stand up for the different minorities in his country who will wake up today more fearful than they have for decades"".However, UKIP's Scottish leader, David Coburn, predicted Mr Trump would be ""good for Scotland"" because of his strong connections to the country. The endorsements of Mrs Clinton by Scottish politicians could backfire once Mr Trump formally become president, according to Fiona Hill, an analyst at the Brookings think tank in Washington.She said: ""It might actually matter because Donald Trump does take things quite personally. ""He's made it quite clear that when he has a rift on a personal and business level that he's quite serious about responding.""But the former US assistant Secretary of State, Kurt Volker, doubted that these past concerns would feature prominently in the new president's thinking. He said the focus would instead be on global issues including Russia, the economy, Islamic State and forging a new relationship with the UK after Brexit. More than 1,000 students from the University of Edinburgh packed into the city centre to watch the battle for the White House unfold at an event dubbed by organisers as ""the largest US election night party in the UK outside of London"". Organised by Edinburgh University North American Society and the Edinburgh Political Union, the sold-out event in Potterrow saw TV screens beaming results live from across the Atlantic with experts from the school of history providing live analysis on the results throughout the night. The US Consulate General also held an event on Tuesday night at Edinburgh University with hundreds of North American ex-pats attending to watch the results come in. At Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf course, Sarah Malone, executive vice president of Trump International, said it was a ""truly historic day"" and he would serve with ""unwavering passion and commitment"".However, Menie resident Susan Munro, who fought Trump over his golf development, said her reaction to the win was ""shock horror"".She added: ""He would not have been my choice anyway. It will be interesting""."

We will maintain a strong presence in America, including opening our latest office in Atlanta,"" the first minister added.The UK government's Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the relationship between the UK and the US ""goes much deeper than any one individual, be it a leader in this country or a leader in the United States"".He said: ""It's about the people, it's about our cultures. We are so closely aligned and of course we will do everything to make the Trump presidency a success."" Andrew RT Davies tweeted the result was ""yet another punch for political polling - seems another remarkable failure on that front"".He said it was: ""Another bloody nose for the political establishment.""Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood called for ""calm heads"" and the need for ""winding down the rhetoric"".""If Trump wants to do business with the rest of the world, he must row back on the appalling comments we saw throughout the campaign,"" she said.Neil Hamilton, UKIP's leader in the assembly, said: ""It's an uprising of people against the Washington establishment in the same way as Brexit was an uprising against the European establishment.""He said he was surprised Mr Trump won, but believed it was ""good news for Britain"".""Far from [outgoing president] Barack Obama saying we'll be at the back of the queue in a trade deal, Donald Trump has made it perfectly clear he's very pro-Britain which is good news,"" Mr Hamilton said.Flintshire-based David Soutter, a former head of candidates for UKIP who worked on the UK Trump campaign, said the Republican candidate's victory was ""very easy to predict"".""For 25 years the political establishment has grown apart from those whom it is supposed to represent,"" he said.""It is clear in Europe and the UK, and it was very clear in the US.""Sending his congratulations, Monmouth Conservative MP David Davies told his Twitter followers: ""Surprise of media and anger of commentators shows their failure to listen to, or understand a silent majority.""Former Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said: ""America is a great nation. Still is.""Strong and tested institutions will cope, and our deep and wide friendship with US more important than ever.""However, many Labour politicians reacted with concern, with Neath AM Jeremy Miles saying on Twitter that it was a ""dark morning""."

2016-11-10,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing due in December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its end of March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go ahead for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit.Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the Eu. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should seek to end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament,"" he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances.

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."
2016-11-10,Two of a kind?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922961,"""It'll be Brexit plus plus plus!"" said Donald Trump. It was. If Brexit felt like a political earthquake, the election of this populist president was off the seismic scale, the continental plates shifting underneath the country which has defined our modern world.Obama had that poster - ""Hope"" in cool colours. Trump paints in brasher, bolder strokes. His triumph is a release of pent-up anger but it is still about that same yearning for a change. Make no mistake. This victory, like Brexit, gives a new hope for a better future to those who backed it - and their aspirations and expectations will be sky high. Both left the political establishment, not to mention the pollsters, reeling in shock. I am glad on this occasion I had been telling everyone who'd listen, that after last June's Brexit shock and the UK General Election's surprise I just didn't trust the polls. After all if people were ""shy"" of admitting they backed David Cameron how much more bashful would they feel in declaring for Trump? My gut feeling was that he would win. In my five years in the US I'd seen the frustration and fury mounting.It is perhaps ironic that our two countries, with a reputation for stable political systems, have delivered political revolutions of such importance. Or perhaps it's not. Perhaps their stability and strength is they can cope with popular revolts, without pitchforks or getting blood all over our sans culottes.  The wave of populism all over the West has already delivered a very right-wing government in Hungary, and a very left-wing one in Greece. For years there has been a mounting mood, a disconnect between politicians and people which finds expression in a search for politics outside the old norms. Those of us who've been urging people to pay attention to these movements shouldn't now gloat about our foresight but ask hard questions about the political response, from left, right and centre.There's no doubt the election of the 45th president and Brexit have similar roots. But word of caution for both sides of the Atlantic - voters are individuals, and this is a mood, not a party programme. As Trump put it, not a campaign but ""a great movement"". People who voted for either revolution may share some of the concerns outlined below, but not others. Indeed, if there was a simple root cause it wouldn't be so powerful.Be cautious about the theory this is all about the ""left behinds"" - older, poorly-educated white workers disposed by globalisation, the children and grandchildren of the rust belt. It is not wrong, but it is not sufficient. Those whose jobs have gone to Mexico and China, those who did well-paid jobs undercut by immigration, are indeed of a mood against neoliberalism and globalisation. But that is a simple story about the economy that doesn't quite do justice to the complexity of the last 30 years.  In today's economy many more than just the disposed working class feel left out. The gap between the very rich and the rest widens, bills and insecurity pile up, but neither their prospects nor the economy grows apace. It isn't getting any better.Few politicians dare tell them that increased automation may take more jobs than immigrants. You can't deport a driverless truck. Nevertheless, the fears of the economic and cultural effects of immigration looms very large.Behind it lurk worries about an insecurity about identity. While some feel at home in Beijing, Berlin or Birmingham, others no longer feel at home in their home. I'll be interested to see if the detailed breakdown proves me wrong but, let's face it, it doesn't seem to be economically insecure black or Hispanic voters who backed The Donald.If the UK has very similar concerns there is an added component in the US. Either because of its history of civil war and slavery, there's little doubt race is a critical factor - some whites feel that America is no longer their property - because it isn't. Another difference. In the US the evangelical Christian right, very concerned about abortion and changing sexual morality, is a force we don't have in the UK. But in both countries distaste for the liberal elite goes hand in hand with a despair at a government that is seemingly unresponsive and out of touch. This is very much stronger in the States than here, when Washington is almost a swear word, where a gridlocked Congress has frozen most attempts to get things done.  The American system was designed to be slow, and block change unless it is consensual (itself arguably a legacy of slavery). But that system feels broken, dysfunctional, almost beyond repair. And here's my own hobby horse - while American elections are ideal reality TV, the nuts and bolts of democratic politics can seem almost quaint in an internet age of huge choice.When we can change our mortgage or our energy company at the click of a mouse, voting for one of two bundles of policies every four or five years seems curiously sluggish. I wrote last week that if Donald Trump was seen as a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, it was worth remembering that people bought that patent medicine because every other remedy had failed.As one European central banker said recently, people sway the bridge because it no longer seems a way of crossing the river. The volume of articles peering behind the populism will grow. But we need people who change the world, rather than describe it.  We need to hear coherently and urgently from those on every side of the debate. Those who support globalisation and immigration need to step up to the plate and be more specific about the benefits of their project. Those, like Theresa May, who seem to accept part of the populist message must be urged to spell out how they square the circle of a linked world economy of free trade with answering concerns about industrial policy and identity. And, of course, those who caustically and brilliantly articulate the concerns need to develop solutions.The president-elect has a few months to work out how to turn a howl of anguish into effective policy. No doubt along with a few good soundbites. From anguish to hope to relief is a long journey.Some members of the US establishment argue that Donald Trump can be contained or that, having achieved his aim, the brutal rhetoric will be ditched, he won't really build a wall, ban Muslims, deport millions of illegal immigrants or make the Middle Eastern desert glow. That may be so. He will be a hero for a good while and the outrage of liberals, combined with his brutalist charisma, will be a bulwark against criticism from his own side, for a while. But he must be aware the hard right cherish myths of betrayal and  it will, after a while, swoop like a hawk on any backsliding.  There is a deeper danger. At the heart of his presidency will be how he deals with immigration and the economy. Anyone who has travelled America's roads and rails and used its airports will understand Trump's call for massive investment in infrastructure. Such a Keynesian stimulus would provide ""shovel ready"" jobs for the dispossessed. But it is hard to see where the cash would come from, if he is curbing Americans' overspending, and drastically cutting taxation. Similarly, there could be strains in the Trump coalition between those who want a radically smaller government and one that sticks its oar into big companies and banks. The biggest questions will be about his character and control. But his supporters may relish the occasional outburst. But the real lesson of this election is the breadth and depth of his ambition. Remember, in reality Obama was very cautious and promised very little. Trump has promised the moon by comparison. If he delivers it he will be a transformative figure who we have all underestimated. If he fails, there will still be millions of angry, disillusioned Americans still searching for hope."
2016-11-10,The Trump Story,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35318432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLong before he was a contender for the US presidency, Donald Trump was America's most famous and colourful billionaire. Once considered a long shot, Trump is now the next president of the United States. Scepticism over Trump's candidacy stemmed not only from his controversial platform on immigration and outrageous campaign style, but from his celebrity past. But the 70-year-old businessman had the last laugh when he defied all predictions to beat much more seasoned politicians in the Republican primary race. And he has now gone a step further by winning the presidential election, after one of the most divisive and controversial contests in living memory against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump is the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to work the lowest-tier jobs within his father's company and was sent off to a military academy at age 13 when he started misbehaving in school.He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and became the favourite to succeed his father after his older brother, Fred, chose to become a pilot. Fred Trump died at 43 due to alcoholism, an incident that his brother says led him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes his entire life.Mr Trump says he got into real estate with a ""small"" $1m loan from his father before joining the company. He helped manage his father's extensive portfolio of residential housing projects in the New York City boroughs, and took control of the company - which he renamed the Trump Organization - in 1971. His father died in 1999. ""My father was my inspiration,"" Mr Trump said at the time. Mr Trump shifted his family's business from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the most famous Trump property, the 68-storey Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Other properties bearing the famous name followed - Trump Place, Trump World Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and so on. There are Trump Towers in Mumbai, Istanbul and the Philippines. Mr Trump also developed hotels and casinos, an arm of the business that has led to four bankruptcy filings (for the businesses, not personal bankruptcy).Mr Trump also built an empire in the entertainment business. From 1996 until 2015, he was an owner in the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. In 2003, he debuted an NBC reality television show called The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a shot at a management job within Mr Trump's organisation. He hosted the show for 14 seasons, and claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of $213m by the network during the show's run. He has written several books, and owns a line of merchandise that sells everything from neckties to bottled water. According to Forbes, his net worth is $3.7bn, though Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted he is worth $10bn.Trump has been married three times, though his most famous wife was his first - Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. The couple had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - before they filed for divorce in 1990. The ensuing court battle made for numerous stories in the tabloid press. Those stories included allegations that Trump was abusive towards Ivana, though she later downplayed the incidents.He married actress Marla Maples in 1993. They had a daughter named Tiffany together before divorcing in 1999. He married his current wife Melania Knauss, a model, in 2005, and the couple have one son, Barron William Trump. His children from his first marriage now help run Trump Organization, though he is still chief executive.Mr Trump expressed interest in running for president as early as 1987, and even entered the 2000 race as a Reform Party candidate.  After 2008, he became one of the most outspoken members of the ""birther"" movement, which questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the US. Those claims have been thoroughly debunked; Mr Obama was born in Hawaii. Mr Trump finally admitted there was no truth in the claims during the presidential race, although, characteristically, there was no apology.It was not until June 2015 that Mr Trump formally announced his entrance into the race for the White House.""We need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that,"" he said in his announcement speech, promising that as a candidate with no need to fundraise he answered to no special interests and was the perfect outsider candidate.Under the banner Make America Great Again, Trump has run a controversial campaign built on promises to strengthen the American economy, build a wall on the border of Mexico and the US, and to temporarily ban immigration by Muslims ""until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"".Despite massive protests at his campaign events and the best efforts of his Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Trump became the presumptive Republican party nominee for president after the Indiana primary.Mr Trump's campaign for the presidency was rocked by controversies, including the emergence of a recording from 2005 of him making lewd remarks about women, and claims, including from members of his own party, that he was not fit for office.But he consistently told his army of supporters that he would defy the opinion polls, which mostly had him trailing Hillary Clinton, and that his presidency would strike a blow against the political establishment and ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.He took inspiration from the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, saying he would pull off ""Brexit times 10"".It was something few pundits believed would happen as polling day approached, despite his campaign receiving a late boost from fresh controversy over an FBI investigation into his opponent's emails.As his stunning victory was still sinking in across the US, his supporters got the chance to see him in the Oval Office when he and President Obama met for transition talks two days after election day.He will be the first US president never to have held elected office or served in the military, meaning that he has already made history before he is sworn in as America's 45th president in January."
2016-11-10,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922587,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link53%of men; 41% backed Clinton42%of women; 54% voted for Clinton58% of white voters - 37% backed Clinton 8% of black voters - 88% voted for Clinton 29% of Hispanics - 65% supported Clinton Donald Trump has beaten Hillary Clinton in the race to be president of the United States.Much of the narrative ahead of the election had been that Mr Trump was supported by angry, white men. To get an insight into which groups actually voted for him, you can look at the exit poll conducted across the country by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.It is very difficult to get a genuinely representative sample of how more than 120 million people have voted. It is a big survey - of almost 25,000 voters - and they are the best figures available, but they should be used with caution. It throws up some odd results, such as that 10% of people who support the idea of a wall along the Mexican border nonetheless voted for Mrs Clinton, while 5% of people who thought the next president should continue the policies of Barack Obama voted for Mr Trump. Bear in mind that the proportions are unlikely to add up to 100%, because not everybody answered all the questions and there were other candidates standing in the election, who received about 5% of the votes.The poll suggests that 53% of men voted for Mr Trump, with 41% voting for Mrs Clinton - those proportions are almost exactly reversed for women.Among white voters (who made up 70% of voters), Mr Trump won 58% to Mrs Clinton's 37%, while the Democratic candidate won the support of a huge majority of black voters - 88% to Mr Trump's 8% - and Hispanic voters - 65% to his 29%.Looking specifically at white women, they favoured Mr Trump, with 53% supporting him compared with 43% for Mrs Clinton. It has been widely reported that the 29% of Hispanic voters who supported Mr Trump was greater than the 27% who voted for the Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, despite Mr Trump's comments about Mexicans and plans to build a wall on the US's southern border.Mrs Clinton had the majority of voters on lower incomes, with 52% of those on incomes below $50,000 (£40,000) a year supporting her compared with 41% voting for her opponent. Among those earning more than $50,000, it was 49% to Mr Trump compared with 47% to Mrs Clinton.Mrs Clinton's support among those on incomes below $30,000 was well down on President Obama's in 2012. He had 63% support from that group compared with 35% voting for Mitt Romney, while Mrs Clinton had 53% support to Mr Trump's 41%.There was also a big swing for voters without a high school diploma, with Mr Trump leading 51% to Mrs Clinton's 45%. Four years ago, President Obama had 64% support from this group compared with Mitt Romney's 35%.Mr Trump won the rural vote by 62% to 34% and the suburban vote by 50% to 45%, while Mrs Clinton won the urban vote by 59% to 35%.And he had a clear majority among those aged 45 and over, while Mrs Clinton was more popular with younger voters.There were stories before the election of Republicans planning to vote for Mrs Clinton because they did not like their own candidate, but the exit poll actually suggested that 7% of people who identified themselves as Republicans had voted for Mrs Clinton, while 9% of those who identified as Democrats had voted for Mr Trump.Of people who gave their opinion of the candidate they voted for, 41% strongly favoured them, 32% had reservations and 25% said they disliked the opponents.Also among the slightly odd findings of the poll, 18% of respondents who felt that Mr Trump was not qualified to be president nonetheless voted for him, as did 20% of those who felt he did not have the necessary temperament.And 2% of respondents who said they would feel scared if Mr Trump won, still voted for him, compared with 1% who voted for Mrs Clinton, despite saying they would be scared if she won."
2016-11-10,Special relationship?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37851551,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkDonald Trump has been elected 45th president of the United States. But what plans has the UK got in place and what could it mean for its position in the world?It is 20 January 2017 and a cold wind is blowing across Washington's Capitol as Donald John Trump raises his right hand and proclaims that he will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States.As he looks the chief justice in the eye, hundreds of millions of people around the world are wondering what his four-year term will bring.Among them are UK civil servants and politicians, pondering - with negotiations for leaving the European Union also soon to begin - what all this means for their country.So, how well prepared is the UK for dealing with Mr Trump, who has never previously held elected office, and how is the future looking?The UK and US share a language and much cultural heritage, but, argues Tim Oliver, a fellow in European-North American relations at the London School of Economics, the truly ""special"" quality in their relationship is the sharing of intelligence, as well as co-operation over nuclear weapons and special forces.Mr Oliver says there is a risk this could ""sour"" because of the ""degree of distrust and unease"" felt by the government towards Mr Trump, ""an erratic president who appears willing to do anything when it comes to torture, bombing, relations with authoritarian states"".Critics accuse Mr Trump of isolationism, but he describes his foreign policy stance as one of ""Americanism, not globalism"". He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.The UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?""A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,"" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. ""But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.  It's pretty lonely out there without Nato allies.""Before the European Union referendum, President Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to ""the back of the queue"" for signing trade deals with the US if it opted for Brexit. Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.His trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he ""absolutely"" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.""I could see that happening,"" says Ms Schake, ""especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  ""A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.""Mr Trump's election website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.Theresa May did not offer an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"".Asked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: ""I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK. So, in the early days of the Trump administration, one might anticipate some awkward moments, requiring delicate diplomacy.""The UK government has a genius for figuring out how to get along with and be influential with new American administrations,"" says Ms Schake, who works as a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.Tony Blair managed to move from a close friendship with Bill Clinton to another with George W Bush. More trickily, in 1992, John Major's Conservative Party, fresh from an unexpected victory over Labour, helped George HW Bush's re-election campaign. Bush lost to Clinton and there was some initial awkwardness, which was overcome.The problem is, Ms Schake argues, that ""Trump seems to be exceedingly thin-skinned and grudge-holding"", adding: ""But it's a mighty large crowd of foreigners who've had alarming or disparaging things to say, so he won't have much choice other than to take friends where he can get them.""Personal relationships are key to diplomacy and civil servants will have been gleaning as much information on Mr Trump and his potential team as they can.""Hillary Clinton is clearly extremely well known in the UK. People will know the sort of people she's looking to use in her administration,"" said Jill Rutter, a former Downing Street and Treasury civil servant who works for the Institute for Government, her comments coming before the US voted.""Often the people in senior positions will have held more junior or middling roles in previous ones, so you can build connections.""I would have thought that extremely difficult with Trump. You can look back at the George W Bush administration, but how many of the people who served in it would do the same for Trump?""Many mainstream Republicans criticised or refused to endorse Mr Trump, including both Presidents Bush and Mr McCain.We know his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, will be vice-president. Other senior figures in his campaign include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Mr Trump is a famous man, with a long career in business and a stint in reality TV, but, argues Mr Oliver, he comes with many ""known unknowns"", particularly the identities of those who would serve in his administration.Another complication exists. In the US, senior appointees have to be confirmed by the Senate. Even with a Republican majority, the party establishment may be less than helpful, making personnel even harder to predict.Then, says Mr Oliver, the UK, and the rest of the world, will have to deal with ""unknown unknowns, such as what Trump might say or do next"".""I don't know to what extent the British embassy in Washington has been able to get close to the Trump campaign,"" said Ms Rutter.""If he gets elected, then we will have to go into the Washington version of Kremlinology, trying to work out what's really going on.""Well, that's started."

While some petitions - like Jamie Oliver's petition to tax sugary drinks - can make it all the way into law, others aren't quite so successful. But what the Petitions Committee gives to Jamie Oliver, it takes away from may others, rejecting petitions that fall foul of its standards - set out in full here. Here's a quick run through some of the most common reasons petitions never make it:The Petitions Committee can't nominate someone for an honour - there's already a system in place for members of the public to nominate people directly.There's hope for some petitioners though - this petition calling for police horses and dogs to be given the same legal protections as their human colleagues will be debated in parliament's Westminster Hall on 14 November. The most popular e-petitions ever cover some slightly less unusual subjects.The petition with the most signatures - over four million of them - called on the government to hold a second EU membership referendum if either Leave or Remain were backed by less than 60% of voters and saw a turnout of less than 75%.The petition, which attracted a flood of signatures after June's Brexit vote, was debated in September, but there's been no sign of another referendum. Another petition that gained widespread attention was a call for parliament to ban Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from entering the UK. It was debated in January 2016. Mr Trump remains free to visit Britain.Despite these petitions successfully making it into the debating chamber, one member of the public felt Parliament would be better off without having to talk about them:"

2016-11-10,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."
2016-11-10,'Indyref 2' being pushed online,https://web.archive.org//web/20161111002255/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36615645,"As the EU referendum count turned decisively towards Leave, the online conversation in Scotland immediately turned to the possibility of another vote on independence.The idea has been long been dubbed ""indyref 2"" and that hashtag shot to the top of Twitter's trends list shortly after the vote result became clear. Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

2016-11-11,Mothers 'missing out' on pension rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37951066,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTens of thousands of parents - and mothers in particular - are in danger of missing out on some of their state pension rights, according to a study.The research, for Royal London Insurance, suggests that as many as 38,000 women from high-earning families could be affected.Royal London said that mothers have lost £278m in eventual pension rights in the last two years alone.The reason is that they have decided to stop claiming child benefit.Stay-at-home mothers who claim the payments are given national insurance (NI) credits towards their pension, as if they were still at work.But since January 2013, any parent earning more than £60,000 has had to pay child benefit back to the government, through the tax system.As a result, some people are no longer bothering to claim it in the first place.""It is vital that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) takes action to ensure that these women get the national insurance credits which should be theirs by right,"" said Steve Webb, policy director at Royal London, and a former pensions minister in the coalition government.""Otherwise the cause of gender equality in state pensions will have been set back a generation,"" he added.A parent who has not claimed child benefit for the last two years could lose £231 a year when he or she comes to receive their state pension, according to Royal London.In response, an HMRC spokesman said families had always been able to submit a child benefit claim form to help protect their future right to the state pension. ""We provide specific information to all new mothers and on gov.uk,"" said a spokesman.""If anyone is worried about their national insurance record, they can contact HMRC at any time to check how many years of credits and contributions they have built up.""The issue will not affect all mothers who do not claim child benefit. Women who previously claimed it, and then stopped doing so, are protected by transitional arrangements.""It is reassuring that there are transitional rules to keep the half a million stay-at-home parents in the system who were already getting child benefit when the rules changed and who then opted out,"" said Jon Greer, pension expert at Old Mutual Wealth.""However, over time those people will become the minority."" Others will be able to make up their NI credits by returning to work. To claim the new state pension in full, workers need to have 35 years of NI contributions.Those who are affected are being advised to claim child benefit at the ""Nil rate"", by completing the form Child Benefit: CH2."

Discussed America's longstanding and close relationship with the UK.""BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale noted that the US vice president-elect had opted not to use the phrase ""special relationship"". Mr Johnson, who last year suggested that Mr Trump had been ""out of his mind"" for suggesting a ban on Muslims entering the US, has insisted the UK should be optimistic about the future following Mr Trump's victory.At a news conference on Thursday, before speaking to Mr Pence, he said it was time to be ""overwhelmingly positive about the possibilities"" of a Trump presidency and described the US president-elect as a ""deal maker"".""I believe that this is a great opportunity for us in the UK to build on that relationship with America that is of fundamental economic importance to us, but also, great importance for the stability and prosperity of the world,"" Mr Johnson said.""I would respectfully say to my beloved European friends and colleagues that it's time that we snapped out of the general doom and gloom about the result of this election and collective whinge-o-rama that seems to be going on in some places.""But former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I don't think Donald Trump quite yet knows what the pressures will be on him when he becomes president.""We've seen that when he feels slighted, when he feels criticised, he reacts quite fiercely. If you translate that into global affairs it could have consequences which are dangerous for everyone.""Sir John said one of the failures of President Obama's administration had been managing relations with Russia: ""We're getting back into a world which is quite dangerous, and I think that is the biggest threat.""Meanwhile Downing Street has rejected claims that ministers will be forced to use Nigel Farage as a ""go-between"" with the Trump administration.The Daily Telegraph reported ministers would have to seek the advice of UKIP's interim leader because they have no links to the president-elect. But sources close to the prime minister told the BBC that Mr Trump, who defeated Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, favoured a relationship with Theresa May as close as that of former UK and US leaders Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.Mr Trump invited Mrs May to visit Washington, during a phone call on Thursday in which both stressed the importance of UK-US relations. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says Downing Street has been ""hugely irritated"" with the claim ministers were seeking the services of Mr Farage in forging links with the Trump administration. A source close to Mr Farage made it clear that he had no intention of working with Conservative ministers."
2016-11-11,Some MPs 'ready to vote against Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37944473,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLiberal Democrat, some Labour and SDLP MPs have told the BBC they are prepared to vote against triggering Article 50.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said his party would oppose it, unless they were promised a second referendum on the UK's Brexit deal with EU leaders.Several Labour MPs are also willing to vote against it, despite the Labour Party pledging not to do so.The government says Lib Dem and Labour MPs are ""trying to thwart and reverse the referendum result"". With the support of Conservative MPs and the support or abstention of most Labour MPs, the bill is well placed to pass through the Commons.But the opposition of some MPs is likely to embolden critics in the House of Lords.The Liberal Democrats have long called for a referendum on the outcome of the government's negotiations with EU, but only now have they said they will definitely vote against Article 50 if their demand is not met.Mr Farron, whose party has eight MPs in the Commons, told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""Article 50 would proceed but only if there is a referendum on the terms of the deal and if the British people are not respected then, yes, that is a red line and we would vote against the government.""For Labour, shadow minister Catherine West, former leadership contender Owen Smith and south London MP Helen Hayes all made clear they were prepared to vote against Article 50 - which begins formal exit negotiations with the EU - if amendments were not accepted.Former Labour minister David Lammy and shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner have said they would oppose Article 50. Opposition whip Thangam Debbonaire said she would also vote against it, if a vote were held imminently. The SNP's 54 MPs may join them. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said they will not vote for anything that undermines the will of the Scottish people, and has previously said they will vote against a bill to write EU provisions into British law to prepare for Brexit.Dulwich Labour MP Hayes said she was prepared to defy Labour whips to oppose the measure unless the government promised a second referendum.She said: ""I had somebody in my surgery last week who was in tears because of Brexit and I see genuine distress amongst my constituents about what this path means. ""I would not be representing them if I voted to trigger Article 50 on the basis of no information from the government about the path that they would then take us on.""In posts on Twitter and Facebook earlier this week, shadow Foreign Office minister Catherine West wrote: ""As I have said before, I stand with the people of Hornsey & Wood Green, and I will vote against Brexit in Parliament."" Owen Smith confirmed to Today that if his bid for a second referendum failed, he was likely to oppose the bill.The SDLP's three MPs will also oppose the measure.Ministers said MPs voting against Article 50 would effectively be trying to re-run the referendum in the hope of a ""different answer"".""Parliament voted by a margin of six to one to put the decision on whether to remain in or leave the EU in the hands of the British people,"" said Brexit minister David Jones.""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to respect the outcome of the referendum and make a success of Brexit.""Last week the High Court ruled Parliament must be consulted about leaving the European Union.Unless the Supreme Court overturns the judgement in December, a bill to invoke Article 50 is expected in the new year.Labour made clear its official position would be not to frustrate the process of leaving the EU after a newspaper report said the party leader Jeremy Corbyn intended to force a general election unless ministers caved in to demands. After the story broke Labour sources said that while it would seek to amend the bill, it would provide ""unconditional"" support.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would not frustrate the process and would not vote down Article 50.However, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will try to amend the bill in the House of Lords. So too will one Conservative peer - Baroness Wheatcroft."

They cite Donald Trump's election as US president as a motivation to ""assist the struggle to transform Labour"". The internal battle with the Militant tendency faction was one of Labour's biggest controversies of the 1980s.Mr Taaffe, who was expelled from Labour in 1983, said: ""We want to play our part in the struggle to transform Labour and urge the National Executive Committee to aid this process by admitting us, and others who have been similarly expelled or excluded, into membership.""Mr Taaffe, now the general secretary of the Socialist Party, was expelled along with ex-MP Mr Nellist - now the chairman of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC).Their affiliations with Labour rivals mean it appears unlikely that their applications to rejoin the party will be approved.A Labour spokeswoman told the BBC: ""It is against Labour's rules to be a member of another political party or organisation which has its own programme, principles and policy, or distinctive and separate propaganda, and which is therefore ineligible for affiliation to the party.""The application comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was caught up in a row over warnings of Trotskyist entryism from deputy leader Tom Watson.In August 2016, shortly before Mr Corbyn's successful re-election as leader, Mr Watson wrote to him saying ""It's not a conspiracy theory to say that members of [Militant] are joining Labour. It's a fact.""The Labour leader told The Observer his deputy was talking ""nonsense"", saying: ""I just ask Tom to do the maths - 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. ""At no stage in anyone's most vivid imagination are there 300,000 sectarian extremists at large in the country who have suddenly descended on the Labour party.""The 75 expelled Labour members have pitched their application directly at Mr Corbyn, saying his re-election in September ""marked the beginning of a new struggle against a capitalist establishment""Their statement continued: ""We want to play our part in seeing that struggle through to victory."""

UKIP has not yet selected its candidate - leadership contender Suzanne Evans and Victoria Ayling are thought to be in the running.Conservative Stephen Phillips resigned last week, citing ""irreconcilable policy differences"" with the government.The barrister and part-time judge had complained that the government was ""lurching to the right"" and had criticised its attempt to trigger Article 50, beginning the formal process for the UK to leave the EU, without a vote by MPs. The High Court has since ruled that the government must consult MPs - although ministers are appealing against the decision to the Supreme Court.Dr Johnson, who is married with three children, said she was delighted to be selected, adding: ""I am the only person who can support the prime minister and the government to deliver Brexit. I am completely behind the government's plans for Brexit and to deliver on the decision made by the British people.""Mr Clarke, a trade unionist and former postman, said he was honoured to fight the seat for Labour and would stand up for locals in Parliament.""It is not right that in 2016 working people here in Sleaford and North Hykeham are having to choose between heating and eating.""He accused the government of having ""no plan for Brexit"" and pledged to ""hold the government to account on ensuring the best deal for Britain, which protects our local jobs"".Lincolnshire voters were among the most Eurosceptic in the UK, with more than 75% of voters in Boston voting to leave.Local councillor Mark Suffield is standing as an independent while Peter Hill is standing for the Monster Raving Loony Party.

Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said the additional funding was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared to the scale of the housing ""crisis"".He said: ""Ministers are set to spend around £2bn less this year on housing than under Labour.

Brexit means we are now freer to make arrangements.

Asked about the Republican's unexpected election victory against Democrat Hillary Clinton, UKIP's interim leader - in place following the resignation of his successor, Diane James - said he ""couldn't be happier"".He described the result as ""Brexit times two"", adding of his own role in events: ""I'm the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites and all these dreadful people who, working hand-in-glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, have made themselves rich and ruined our countries.""He claimed Mr Trump, who will be inaugurated in January, ""hates the EU even more than I do"" and predicted an improvement in US-UK relations, saying: ""That Obama creature, loathsome individual, couldn't stand our country. He said we'd be at the back of the queue [for trade deals], didn't he?""What was interesting was that Trump said we'd be at the front of the queue.""Mr Farage said it was unlikely the US president-elect would take him on as an adviser, as he was not an American citizen, but told Talk Radio: ""I will be encouraging him to make the United Kingdom his number one global priority.""During the election campaign, a 2005 recording of Mr Trump apparently bragging about groping women was released. This prompted many senior Republicans to abandon support for him.Promising to give Mr Trump ""a drill on British etiquette"", Mr Farage joked: ""I'm now going to become a diplomat. I've got to say, 'Come and schmooze Theresa - don't touch her, for goodness' sake'."" He added: ""If it comes to it, I could be there as the responsible adult, make sure everything's OK.""Meanwhile, UKIP MEP William Dartmouth called Mr Farage the ""best choice"" for the next UK ambassador to Washington.He said: ""On Brexit, the special relationship will be even more important. Nigel Farage already has good ties and a relationship with the US President-elect, Donald Trump - much better than anyone else in British public life. ""His appointment would  materially assist the UK in getting a UK-USA trade agreement for the first time. We in the UK would then  be 'at the front of the queue'."" "

Ms Sturgeon had backed Hillary Clinton ahead of the presidential election. The first minister told MSPs she had faced criticism for breaking the convention that political leaders do not comment on election campaigns in other countries. But she said many of Mr Trump's comments during the campaign had been ""deeply abhorrent"". She said: ""I never want to be, I am not prepared to be, a politician that maintains a diplomatic silence in the face of attitudes of racism, sexism, misogyny or intolerance of any kind.""I hope that president-elect Trump turns out to be a president very different to the kind of candidate he was and reaches out to those who felt vilified by his campaign.""But people of progressive opinion the world over, I think, do have to stand up for the values of tolerance and respect for diversity and difference.""Ms Sturgeon added that she wanted to ""engage positively and constructively with the American administration"", but would ""never shy away from standing up for these important principles"".The first minister also said the Scottish government will fully assess the potential impact for Scotland once the new president forms an administration and its priorities are made clear.Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said Mr Trump's behaviour towards women had sent a ""dangerous signal across the world"".She added: ""In January we will have a misogynist in the White House who has boasted about assaulting women and has used the most degrading language possible.""And, of course, Donald Trump's intolerance is not just aimed at women - we all remember the sickening sight of him mocking a disabled journalist. We can't forget his plans to build a wall or ban people of one faith from entering America.""Mr Trump, whose mother was Scottish, has had an uneasy relationship with the country in recent years.Ms Sturgeon stripped him of his role as a business ambassador for the Scottish government in the wake of his call for Muslims not to be allowed into the US.Mr Trump also had a high-profile war of words with Ms Sturgeon's predecessor, Alex Salmond, over the Scottish government's backing for a windfarm near the tycoon's Aberdeenshire golf course."
2016-11-11,Ways Trump's victory might affect the UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37920142,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link He's only gone and done it. Donald Trump has won the US election. So what might his presidency mean for the UK?Part of what has made Donald Trump attractive to voters - a Washington outsider with no political past - is what makes him such an unpredictable factor for the financial world, and its knock-on effects for Britain. The UK, European and Asian markets initially fell on news of America's seismic election result. Many markets then largely recovered. But how far the uncertainty and instability plays out, and what effect that has on, say, UK interest rates, depends on how long global markets stay ""surprised"", says Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management. If UK stock markets, business and consumer confidence were to be dragged down for weeks or even months the Bank of England could move back from its current ""neutral"" position on interest rates, she says, to a ""loosening bias"" - giving a signal to markets that it expects its next move to be a further small cut in interest rates.""But if markets settle as quickly as they have on Wednesday, the Bank of England may decide to hold rates at their current level. And what of the pound? On Wednesday morning, sterling strengthened against the dollar, rising 0.3% to go back above $1.24. Then it promptly fell back to where it had started the day. But in the longer term? The euro also strengthened in early trading, up 0.4% higher against the dollar. But the pound is still a long way beneath where it was before the Brexit vote.""That downward move reflects the fact that markets believe the UK's long-term growth prospects will be weaker following our departure from the EU, and concerns about what our future trade relationships with EU and other economies may be,"" says Ms O'Carroll.""These concerns will remain in play, and are not really affected by Mr Trump's victory.""Prospects are still more about ""the local shock of Brexit"" than what happened across the pond. In victory, Donald Trump's speech struck an unfamiliar, conciliatory tone. He set out his vision for America at home and also pledged to ""get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us"". ""We expect to have great, great relationships,"" he said.Of course, for him, US interests come first. But he said his country would ""deal fairly with everyone"". He added: ""All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict.""UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""looking forward to working"" with him, in a strong ""trade, security and defence"" partnership.  The American Ambassador to the UK , Matthew Barzun, assured the special relationship, as his boss Barack Obama had put it, stayed ""unbreakable and unshakeable"". It's a far cry from the time that Mrs May called the then candidate's comments on Muslims ""divisive, unhelpful and wrong"". Or Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's riposte to comments about London's supposed ""radicalisation"" that he wouldn't visit New York due to the ""real risk of meeting Donald Trump"". He now is ""looking forward to working with (Mr Trump) on global stability and prosperity"".Much of Donald Trump's previous dealings in the UK have revolved around his controversial development of a golf course in Aberdeenshire, very much pre-presidency.He has held no political office, forged no foreign policy path, so the impact on military, intelligence, and other shared interests of his campaign vision of ""peace through strength"" is unclear.A huge part of that relationship with the UK and the world is based in trade. Pre-EU referendum, President Obama warned the UK would go to the ""back of the queue"" for a US trade deal if it voted out. The Trump camp is more positive. Trade adviser Dan DiMicco said he ""absolutely"" wanted to strike a trade deal with the UK. Trump himself said it made ""no difference"" if the UK was in the EU or not.His website, however, doesn't mention the UK in its section on trade, instead focusing on the problems he sees in the US relationship with China.China and the US have driven global growth during the past quarter of a century. But the president-elect feels relations between the two are unfairly skewed towards China. He wants it labelled a ""currency manipulator"". And has threatened to tear up global trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the aim of securing a better deal for American workers. That would be a move ""many believe will be bad for global economic growth"", says the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed, with knock-on effects for the UK economy. ""We are also in the middle of the biggest, untested monetary experiment ever attempted by central banks following the financial crisis - $12.3 trillion of quantitative easing or money printing to stop the world lurching into deep recession.""Investors and markets are no longer sure which way is up.""One of the first clues on how Donald Trump may operate in office, compared with what he said as a candidate could come in how he deals with US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.  Her term is due to come to an end in 2018 - she is seen by many as a positive influence for stability. But the president-elect has accused the independent central bank of keeping interest rates low at Democrat President Obama's behest. And what he does next may set some of the tone for his financial policy.There has not yet been a plunge in the dollar that would make the US suddenly more attractive for tourists. But on the less tangible side, does a trip to the US feel less or more appealing? ""Emotionally, the effects are less easy to predict. The welcoming people, Florida theme parks, New York streets, National Park wildernesses and California sunshine will remain the same,"" travel writer Simon Calder says,""But during the campaign Donald Trump invoked fear and hate, and America may feel more divided than it has done since the Vietnam War, with abundant mutual suspicion and distrust.""Longer term, reaching the US could get more difficult, with your faith possibly determining how easy it is to get through passport control,"" he says, referring to Donald Trump's December 2015 call for ""a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". ""Politically that may be impossible to impose, in which case there may well be much stricter controls on every foreign visitor - which will appal states such as Florida that are dependent on tourism.""

2016-11-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing due in December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its end of March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go ahead for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit.Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the Eu. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should seek to end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament,"" he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances.

When across the West the electoral pendulum swung reliably between parties of the centre left and centre right? There was consensus about the benefits of a global market economy. Politicians seemed to talk the same way, wear the same ties, parrot the same stale slogans. Meanwhile voters got on with shopping, and turning out at elections in ever decreasing numbers. This seemed to be the condition of liberal democracy at the start of 2016. But the seedbed for Brexit and Trump was there. As politics became the preserve of a professional office-seeking class the old parties shrank. Popular indifference and distrust of politics grew. A few years ago the political scientist Peter Mair argued that Western democracy was being hollowed out. With one referendum and a presidential election, liberal democracy as we've known it seems finally, dramatically, to have collapsed in on itself. Too hyperbolic? In response to Donald Trump's victory, the authoritarian, anti-immigration Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, said it was ""great news"" and claimed his victory marked the end of a period of ""liberal non-democracy"". This is the same Viktor Orban who was greeted with a mock-Nazi salute by the president of the European Commission at a summit last year. ""The dictator is coming,"" quipped Jean-Claude Juncker. Now many Western leaders are sweating. Last month the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the West's political values were in danger of breaking down. What does he think those values are? ""Human rights, civil liberties, including the freedom of speech and religion, free market and a competitive economy based on private property, reasonable and fair redistribution of goods, restrictions on power resulting from rules and tradition, tolerance and political pluralism."" Mr Tusk said those who questioned liberal democracy were happy about Brexit, looked up to President Putin and supported Donald Trump. And it's true that from the coffee shops of Brooklyn to the bistros of Brussels there is a sense of melancholy and foreboding. For people who have enjoyed the political stability and economic opportunities delivered by decades of liberal democracy these are bewildering, unsettling times. ""How"", they ask, ""can Britain possibly have voted to leave the EU?"" Millions of despairing Americans are grappling with the prospect of President Donald Trump. ""Is Le Pen next?"" they fret in the cafes of Paris. But for voters who cast ballots for Brexit and Donald Trump it feels like politics has finally listened to them. The ""left behind"" economic narrative does not account for the full variety of forces behind this new populism. But in the view of Parag Khanna, an American professor in Singapore and author of the new book Connectography, 2016 will be remembered as the year that ""the global underclass revolt crystallised in the form of the Brexit and the Trump election"".""This uncoordinated movement really began with Occupy Wall Street and has now claimed its biggest scalp,"" he says.Prof Vernon Bogdanor, at King's College London, agrees. ""There is a division between the exam-passing classes who are not hostile to the global elite and the left behind who are nationalist and protectionist,"" he says.""It takes different forms in different countries but it's now a fairly common phenomenon in Europe and America.""Prof Bogdanor tells me the new political cleavage is not between left and right but between nationalist populism and those perceived as ""elites"". And he is worried.""The election of Donald Trump is the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It's not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s. We're seeing a pale imitation of what we saw then"", he says, while careful to make clear he doesn't consider the president-elect a fascist. But Claire Fox, the director of the Institute of Ideas, thinks the vitality of liberal democracy has been proved by the Brexit and Trump results. ""We have to be careful of an anti-democratic response to perfectly legitimate democratic votes. Quite a lot of liberals are saying, 'well, democracy is not working so well because people are voting in a way we don't want them to vote', which strikes me as a supreme irony."" A suffocating political and cultural consensus has driven the backlash we are seeing now, she believes. ""There has been arguably far less tolerance over the last 10 years for anyone who doesn't agree with what a particular elite outlook is - and a silence or demonising of people who don't go along with the narrative."" Ms Fox cites public concern about immigration as a prime example and she also takes exception to the suggestion liberal democracy is being threatened by an ugly authoritarianism. ""The whole of the establishment, from army generals to big business, lined up to say Brexit was a mistake,"" she argues. ""What's authoritarian is employers turning round to their workers and saying jobs would be lost. ""We had an elite who thought they could call a referendum, mobilise everybody who should go and vote as they were told. That's caused a massive tantrum amongst the elite who then have the nerve to say it's the people's fault for threatening democracy.""Whether or not this political upheaval should be celebrated or feared, it feels like a rupture with the past. We are rumbling over an important set of points with little idea where we are heading. Brexit and Trump promised political control to people who felt their lives had little of it, who were furious at the gulf between their political rulers and the governed and mourned the social cohesion of the past, and whose voices were not heard much in the media. In the raucous, angry echo chamber of social media a fight back brewed. The flipside seems to be growing intolerance of pluralism and difference. That is why people like Donald Tusk anxiously wonder how Western liberal democracy can respond and survive. Because there is nothing inevitable about its continuity. As author and political philosopher John Gray wrote recently, plenty of authoritarian regimes in the world are doing well. The middle class in Russia appears wedded to a combination of consumerism and nationalism and in China many want nothing more than rising living standards and freedom in their private lives. ""Liberal societies cannot depend on history for their survival,"" he says in a New Statesman article. ""They need to defend themselves."" At the moment however, the winners from globalisation and the political elites have lost and the dissenters have won. "
2016-11-11,Voter revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUS voters have delivered a blow to the political establishment by electing outsider Donald Trump to the presidency, much like UK voters did earlier this year when they opted to leave the EU. But just how close are the parallels between Tuesday's result and June's referendum? Were the voters who gave Mr Trump his victory much the same as those who voted to leave the EU? For many on this side of the Atlantic, there was a strong sense of deja vu on Tuesday night as it gradually emerged that Donald Trump has pulled off a dramatic victory. It all seemed reminiscent of the drama that British voters had experienced when in the small hours of 24 June it became apparent that a majority had voted to leave the European Union.One reason of course was that neither result had been expected. In the UK most - though not all - polls put Remain narrowly ahead. In the US most - though again not quite all - polls put Hillary Clinton narrowly in the lead. Read carefully, neither set of polls could in fact be said to point to a clear winner, but most commentators had convinced themselves that Remain and Mrs Clinton respectively would emerge victorious.But another arguably more important reason for the sense of deja vu was the similarity between some of Donald Trump's key campaign messages and those of the Leave campaign. Both majored on concerns about immigration. Both questioned whether the existing global financial order necessarily benefitted the ordinary man in the street. And both portrayed themselves as the underdogs campaigning against an allegedly complacent and out of touch political establishment.In the UK these stances have been shown to appeal in particular to the so-called ""left behind"", that is, voters who feel they have lost out economically in recent years and who are uncomfortable with some of the social changes that have been going on around them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was remarkably successful in such mid-West Rust Belt states as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, where the decline of manufacturing industry has seemingly created a part of America that can also be said to have been ""left behind"". There are certainly some striking similarities between the UK and US voting trends. To begin with, older voters in the UK were inclined to vote to leave the EU, whereas a majority of younger voters were in favour of remaining, according to exit poll data. Similarly, in the US Mrs Clinton was ahead among younger voters, while Mr Trump was more likely to be preferred by older citizens.At the same time, an educational divide was apparent in both ballots. In the UK, polls suggested a majority of university graduates were keen on remaining in the EU, while those without a degree voted to leave. Equally, in the US, exit polls indicate college graduates were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton, whereas those who were not college graduates inclined towards Donald Trump.Moreover, this educational divide was one of the most remarkable features of the US election. Republican candidates do not usually do better among non-graduates than graduates. In 2012 the level of support for the then-Republican standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, was almost exactly the same in the two groups. Here perhaps is the strongest evidence that Mr Trump's campaign messages had a particular resonance for a certain section of the US population that might also be described as ""left behind"".However, perhaps the analogy should not be pushed too far. A closer look at graphic above reveals that the education divide in the EU referendum was rather sharper than that in the US election.In the UK the gap was wide - around three-fifths of graduates voted to remain, while 63% of non-graduates cast a vote for leaving. In the US it was more nuanced - only just over half of college graduates voted for Mrs Clinton and only just over half of non-graduates backed Mr Trump.Moreover, in other respects the claim that it was the ""left behind"" who took Mr Trump to victory does not match the evidence.  In the UK those who voted to leave often had few, if any, educational qualifications, but also tended to be on lower incomes. Around two-thirds of those with incomes of less than £20,000 ($25,000) a year voted to leave, while around three in five of those earning more than £40,000 ($50,000) backed staying in the EU.But Mr Trump was not particularly successful among low-income voters. In fact, just over half of those with incomes of less than $30,000 (£24,000) voted for Mrs Clinton. Conversely, those on more than $100,000 (£80,000) a year only preferred Mr Trump by the narrowest margins. Mr Trump's campaign messages may have enabled him to reach out to voters with few, if any, qualifications for whom social issues such as immigration are often a particular concern. However, it appears he was less successful at mobilising support among those who might be thought to be economically left behind.There are other parallels between the vote in the US and that in the UK too, though in the case of the US at least they reflect political differences that long predate Mr Trump. The Republican president-elect was well ahead among white voters, but trailed Mrs Clinton heavily amongst the remainder of America's increasingly diverse population. In the UK too, black and minority ethnic voters were disinclined to vote to leave, put off perhaps by the Leave campaign's focus on the issue of immigration.Meanwhile, evangelical Protestants once again turned out for the Republican nominee in very strong numbers, while those who do not profess any religion at all voted heavily for Mrs Clinton.In the UK, too, those who do not claim to belong to any religion - a much larger group than in the US - were inclined to vote to remain. However, the religious divide in the UK largely reflects the fact that younger voters are more likely not to claim some kind of religious identity, rather than having much to do with their religious outlook itself.US elections have also long been marked by a gender difference, with women being more likely to vote Democrat, men to support the Republicans. That, too, was also in evidence on Thursday. That was one divide that was not evident at all in the UK referendum - men and women voted in much the same way. It seems that Mr Trump still has much to learn from UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, now UK foreign secretary, when it comes to wooing women voters.

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."
2016-11-11,Two of a kind?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922961,"""It'll be Brexit plus plus plus!"" said Donald Trump. It was. If Brexit felt like a political earthquake, the election of this populist president was off the seismic scale, the continental plates shifting underneath the country which has defined our modern world.Obama had that poster - ""Hope"" in cool colours. Trump paints in brasher, bolder strokes. His triumph is a release of pent-up anger but it is still about that same yearning for a change. Make no mistake. This victory, like Brexit, gives a new hope for a better future to those who backed it - and their aspirations and expectations will be sky high. Both left the political establishment, not to mention the pollsters, reeling in shock. I am glad on this occasion I had been telling everyone who'd listen, that after last June's Brexit shock and the UK General Election's surprise I just didn't trust the polls. After all if people were ""shy"" of admitting they backed David Cameron how much more bashful would they feel in declaring for Trump? My gut feeling was that he would win. In my five years in the US I'd seen the frustration and fury mounting.It is perhaps ironic that our two countries, with a reputation for stable political systems, have delivered political revolutions of such importance. Or perhaps it's not. Perhaps their stability and strength is they can cope with popular revolts, without pitchforks or getting blood all over our sans culottes.  The wave of populism all over the West has already delivered a very right-wing government in Hungary, and a very left-wing one in Greece. For years there has been a mounting mood, a disconnect between politicians and people which finds expression in a search for politics outside the old norms. Those of us who've been urging people to pay attention to these movements shouldn't now gloat about our foresight but ask hard questions about the political response, from left, right and centre.There's no doubt the election of the 45th president and Brexit have similar roots. But word of caution for both sides of the Atlantic - voters are individuals, and this is a mood, not a party programme. As Trump put it, not a campaign but ""a great movement"". People who voted for either revolution may share some of the concerns outlined below, but not others. Indeed, if there was a simple root cause it wouldn't be so powerful.Be cautious about the theory this is all about the ""left behinds"" - older, poorly-educated white workers disposed by globalisation, the children and grandchildren of the rust belt. It is not wrong, but it is not sufficient. Those whose jobs have gone to Mexico and China, those who did well-paid jobs undercut by immigration, are indeed of a mood against neoliberalism and globalisation. But that is a simple story about the economy that doesn't quite do justice to the complexity of the last 30 years.  In today's economy many more than just the disposed working class feel left out. The gap between the very rich and the rest widens, bills and insecurity pile up, but neither their prospects nor the economy grows apace. It isn't getting any better.Few politicians dare tell them that increased automation may take more jobs than immigrants. You can't deport a driverless truck. Nevertheless, the fears of the economic and cultural effects of immigration looms very large.Behind it lurk worries about an insecurity about identity. While some feel at home in Beijing, Berlin or Birmingham, others no longer feel at home in their home. I'll be interested to see if the detailed breakdown proves me wrong but, let's face it, it doesn't seem to be economically insecure black or Hispanic voters who backed The Donald.If the UK has very similar concerns there is an added component in the US. Either because of its history of civil war and slavery, there's little doubt race is a critical factor - some whites feel that America is no longer their property - because it isn't. Another difference. In the US the evangelical Christian right, very concerned about abortion and changing sexual morality, is a force we don't have in the UK. But in both countries distaste for the liberal elite goes hand in hand with a despair at a government that is seemingly unresponsive and out of touch. This is very much stronger in the States than here, when Washington is almost a swear word, where a gridlocked Congress has frozen most attempts to get things done.  The American system was designed to be slow, and block change unless it is consensual (itself arguably a legacy of slavery). But that system feels broken, dysfunctional, almost beyond repair. And here's my own hobby horse - while American elections are ideal reality TV, the nuts and bolts of democratic politics can seem almost quaint in an internet age of huge choice.When we can change our mortgage or our energy company at the click of a mouse, voting for one of two bundles of policies every four or five years seems curiously sluggish. I wrote last week that if Donald Trump was seen as a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, it was worth remembering that people bought that patent medicine because every other remedy had failed.As one European central banker said recently, people sway the bridge because it no longer seems a way of crossing the river. The volume of articles peering behind the populism will grow. But we need people who change the world, rather than describe it.  We need to hear coherently and urgently from those on every side of the debate. Those who support globalisation and immigration need to step up to the plate and be more specific about the benefits of their project. Those, like Theresa May, who seem to accept part of the populist message must be urged to spell out how they square the circle of a linked world economy of free trade with answering concerns about industrial policy and identity. And, of course, those who caustically and brilliantly articulate the concerns need to develop solutions.The president-elect has a few months to work out how to turn a howl of anguish into effective policy. No doubt along with a few good soundbites. From anguish to hope to relief is a long journey.Some members of the US establishment argue that Donald Trump can be contained or that, having achieved his aim, the brutal rhetoric will be ditched, he won't really build a wall, ban Muslims, deport millions of illegal immigrants or make the Middle Eastern desert glow. That may be so. He will be a hero for a good while and the outrage of liberals, combined with his brutalist charisma, will be a bulwark against criticism from his own side, for a while. But he must be aware the hard right cherish myths of betrayal and  it will, after a while, swoop like a hawk on any backsliding.  There is a deeper danger. At the heart of his presidency will be how he deals with immigration and the economy. Anyone who has travelled America's roads and rails and used its airports will understand Trump's call for massive investment in infrastructure. Such a Keynesian stimulus would provide ""shovel ready"" jobs for the dispossessed. But it is hard to see where the cash would come from, if he is curbing Americans' overspending, and drastically cutting taxation. Similarly, there could be strains in the Trump coalition between those who want a radically smaller government and one that sticks its oar into big companies and banks. The biggest questions will be about his character and control. But his supporters may relish the occasional outburst. But the real lesson of this election is the breadth and depth of his ambition. Remember, in reality Obama was very cautious and promised very little. Trump has promised the moon by comparison. If he delivers it he will be a transformative figure who we have all underestimated. If he fails, there will still be millions of angry, disillusioned Americans still searching for hope."
2016-11-11,The Trump Story,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35318432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLong before he was a contender for the US presidency, Donald Trump was America's most famous and colourful billionaire. Once considered a long shot, Trump is now the next president of the United States. Scepticism over Trump's candidacy stemmed not only from his controversial platform on immigration and outrageous campaign style, but from his celebrity past. But the 70-year-old businessman had the last laugh when he defied all predictions to beat much more seasoned politicians in the Republican primary race. And he has now gone a step further by winning the presidential election, after one of the most divisive and controversial contests in living memory against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump is the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to work the lowest-tier jobs within his father's company and was sent off to a military academy at age 13 when he started misbehaving in school.He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and became the favourite to succeed his father after his older brother, Fred, chose to become a pilot. Fred Trump died at 43 due to alcoholism, an incident that his brother says led him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes his entire life.Mr Trump says he got into real estate with a ""small"" $1m loan from his father before joining the company. He helped manage his father's extensive portfolio of residential housing projects in the New York City boroughs, and took control of the company - which he renamed the Trump Organization - in 1971. His father died in 1999. ""My father was my inspiration,"" Mr Trump said at the time. Mr Trump shifted his family's business from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the most famous Trump property, the 68-storey Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Other properties bearing the famous name followed - Trump Place, Trump World Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and so on. There are Trump Towers in Mumbai, Istanbul and the Philippines. Mr Trump also developed hotels and casinos, an arm of the business that has led to four bankruptcy filings (for the businesses, not personal bankruptcy).Mr Trump also built an empire in the entertainment business. From 1996 until 2015, he was an owner in the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. In 2003, he debuted an NBC reality television show called The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a shot at a management job within Mr Trump's organisation. He hosted the show for 14 seasons, and claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of $213m by the network during the show's run. He has written several books, and owns a line of merchandise that sells everything from neckties to bottled water. According to Forbes, his net worth is $3.7bn, though Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted he is worth $10bn.Trump has been married three times, though his most famous wife was his first - Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. The couple had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - before they filed for divorce in 1990. The ensuing court battle made for numerous stories in the tabloid press. Those stories included allegations that Trump was abusive towards Ivana, though she later downplayed the incidents.He married actress Marla Maples in 1993. They had a daughter named Tiffany together before divorcing in 1999. He married his current wife Melania Knauss, a model, in 2005, and the couple have one son, Barron William Trump. His children from his first marriage now help run Trump Organization, though he is still chief executive.Mr Trump expressed interest in running for president as early as 1987, and even entered the 2000 race as a Reform Party candidate.  After 2008, he became one of the most outspoken members of the ""birther"" movement, which questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the US. Those claims have been thoroughly debunked; Mr Obama was born in Hawaii. Mr Trump finally admitted there was no truth in the claims during the presidential race, although, characteristically, there was no apology.It was not until June 2015 that Mr Trump formally announced his entrance into the race for the White House.""We need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that,"" he said in his announcement speech, promising that as a candidate with no need to fundraise he answered to no special interests and was the perfect outsider candidate.Under the banner Make America Great Again, Trump has run a controversial campaign built on promises to strengthen the American economy, build a wall on the border of Mexico and the US, and to temporarily ban immigration by Muslims ""until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"".Despite massive protests at his campaign events and the best efforts of his Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Trump became the presumptive Republican party nominee for president after the Indiana primary.Mr Trump's campaign for the presidency was rocked by controversies, including the emergence of a recording from 2005 of him making lewd remarks about women, and claims, including from members of his own party, that he was not fit for office.But he consistently told his army of supporters that he would defy the opinion polls, which mostly had him trailing Hillary Clinton, and that his presidency would strike a blow against the political establishment and ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.He took inspiration from the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, saying he would pull off ""Brexit times 10"".It was something few pundits believed would happen as polling day approached, despite his campaign receiving a late boost from fresh controversy over an FBI investigation into his opponent's emails.As his stunning victory was still sinking in across the US, his supporters got the chance to see him in the Oval Office when he and President Obama met for transition talks two days after election day.He will be the first US president never to have held elected office or served in the military, meaning that he has already made history before he is sworn in as America's 45th president in January."
2016-11-11,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922587,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link53%of men; 41% backed Clinton42%of women; 54% voted for Clinton58% of white voters - 37% backed Clinton 8% of black voters - 88% voted for Clinton 29% of Hispanics - 65% supported Clinton Donald Trump has beaten Hillary Clinton in the race to be president of the United States.Much of the narrative ahead of the election had been that Mr Trump was supported by angry, white men. To get an insight into which groups actually voted for him, you can look at the exit poll conducted across the country by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.It is very difficult to get a genuinely representative sample of how more than 120 million people have voted. It is a big survey - of almost 25,000 voters - and they are the best figures available, but they should be used with caution. It throws up some odd results, such as that 10% of people who support the idea of a wall along the Mexican border nonetheless voted for Mrs Clinton, while 5% of people who thought the next president should continue the policies of Barack Obama voted for Mr Trump. Bear in mind that the proportions are unlikely to add up to 100%, because not everybody answered all the questions and there were other candidates standing in the election, who received about 5% of the votes.The poll suggests that 53% of men voted for Mr Trump, with 41% voting for Mrs Clinton - those proportions are almost exactly reversed for women.Among white voters (who made up 70% of voters), Mr Trump won 58% to Mrs Clinton's 37%, while the Democratic candidate won the support of a huge majority of black voters - 88% to Mr Trump's 8% - and Hispanic voters - 65% to his 29%.Looking specifically at white women, they favoured Mr Trump, with 53% supporting him compared with 43% for Mrs Clinton. It has been widely reported that the 29% of Hispanic voters who supported Mr Trump was greater than the 27% who voted for the Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, despite Mr Trump's comments about Mexicans and plans to build a wall on the US's southern border.Mrs Clinton had the majority of voters on lower incomes, with 52% of those on incomes below $50,000 (£40,000) a year supporting her compared with 41% voting for her opponent. Among those earning more than $50,000, it was 49% to Mr Trump compared with 47% to Mrs Clinton.Mrs Clinton's support among those on incomes below $30,000 was well down on President Obama's in 2012. He had 63% support from that group compared with 35% voting for Mitt Romney, while Mrs Clinton had 53% support to Mr Trump's 41%.There was also a big swing for voters without a high school diploma, with Mr Trump leading 51% to Mrs Clinton's 45%. Four years ago, President Obama had 64% support from this group compared with Mitt Romney's 35%.Mr Trump won the rural vote by 62% to 34% and the suburban vote by 50% to 45%, while Mrs Clinton won the urban vote by 59% to 35%.And he had a clear majority among those aged 45 and over, while Mrs Clinton was more popular with younger voters.There were stories before the election of Republicans planning to vote for Mrs Clinton because they did not like their own candidate, but the exit poll actually suggested that 7% of people who identified themselves as Republicans had voted for Mrs Clinton, while 9% of those who identified as Democrats had voted for Mr Trump.Of people who gave their opinion of the candidate they voted for, 41% strongly favoured them, 32% had reservations and 25% said they disliked the opponents.Also among the slightly odd findings of the poll, 18% of respondents who felt that Mr Trump was not qualified to be president nonetheless voted for him, as did 20% of those who felt he did not have the necessary temperament.And 2% of respondents who said they would feel scared if Mr Trump won, still voted for him, compared with 1% who voted for Mrs Clinton, despite saying they would be scared if she won."

2016-11-11,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161112012203/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Mr Vaz quit as chairman of the Home Affairs Select committee in September after the paper claimed he paid for the services of two male escorts.According to the newspaper, the MP also indicated to one of the men that he would pay for cocaine, although he said he would not use the drug himself. Mr Vaz, 59, said he welcomed the police's investigation.   The police said they would not confirm or comment on the identity of anyone involved. The Sunday Mirror story in September included photographs and secret recordings it said were of Mr Vaz with the sex workers in a north London flat he owns. Drugs, including cocaine, were mentioned during a secretly-recorded conversation.The recording also included a discussion about using the party drug known as poppers.Mr Vaz had opposed government attempts to criminalise the drug. Ministers later announced they would remain within the law. Following the initial allegations, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he would be writing to Scotland Yard calling for Mr Vaz to be investigated for misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to supply controlled substances.Scotland Yard said police had received a letter on 7 September asking them to look into the matter.The force said one of its specialist teams then began an assessment process to see ""what criminal offences - if any - may have been committed"".A spokesman said: ""Following that assessment, which included obtaining early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan Police Service is now investigating offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.""The investigation started on Thursday 10 November.""Keith Vaz - the 'Teflon politician'Mr Vaz, the Leicester East MP and a married father-of-two, resigned as chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee two days after the Sunday Mirror's report.In a statement he said: ""I welcome a full investigation as a means of establishing the true facts and I am confident the police will pursue all lines of enquiry. ""I will cooperate with the investigation in any way I can.""Last month Mr Vaz joined the Commons justice committee  after Mr Bridgen tried to block the appointment.The Conservative MP has since called for Mr Vaz to stand down from that committee until any police investigations have concluded.He also called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to suspend Mr Vaz from the party while the police investigate."

An act of democracy has taken place, there is a transition period and we will work with the current and future administrations to ensure the best outcomes for Britain.""What will Trump's foreign policy look like?Five ways the world could changeThe hotel developer who became presidentOn Friday Mr Johnson said: ""With respect to my beloved EU friends and colleagues, I think it is time we snapped out of the general doom and gloom about the result of this election and the collective whinge-o-rama that seems to be going on in some places"".Mr Johnson's remarks are in stark contrast to those of EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.He said Mr Trump's election risked upsetting EU ties with the US ""fundamentally and structurally"".He said: ""We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works"", adding that two years would be wasted while Mr Trump ""tours a world he doesn't know"".Meanwhile, UKIP interim leader Nigel Farage reportedly met Mr Trump's team when he visited New York's Trump Tower on Saturday, warning there were some ""some fences to be mended"" between Britain and the president-elect.He told Fox News Mr Trump would have to deal with Prime Minister Theresa May, despite her top team being ""rude"" about him.""Trump is an Anglophile, he understands and recognises what our two great nations have done together between us. And, thank goodness, we are coming towards the end of an American president who loathed Britain,"" he said.""One of the things we can do, we can have between us a sensible trade relationship, cut tariffs, we are massive investors in each other's countries. There's a bright future.""Tom Brake, Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, accused Mr Johnson of being an ""artless diplomat"" whose decision to snub the meeting would further damage the UK's relationship with other EU leaders.He said Mr Trump's election raised ""a huge number of questions"" for Britain, Europe and the rest of the world, including concerns over potential US protectionism, Nato, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syria.""We face a difficult period for UK foreign relations and having this artless diplomat in charge of proceedings puts us on the back foot,"" he added.Following his victory Mr Trump spoke with Mrs May. A Downing Street spokesman said they agreed that ""the US-UK relationship was very important and very special and that building on this would be a priority for them both"".But a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrat coalition partner, Axel Schafer, said the PM's hope that Mr Trump will look favourably on the UK would come to nothing.Mr Schafer told The Times: ""What changed is the likelihood of a speedy and preferential trade deal between the UK and US. Even before Tuesday the chances were rather low, now the hope for this kind of deal seems delusional."""

He accused the Tories of being like Mr Trump by offering ""slogans, but not solutions for most people in Britain"".The Conservatives said Labour was ""out of step"" with ""ordinary people"". In a speech to the Labour South East Regional Conference, Mr Corbyn described Mr Trump's shock election victory over Hillary Clinton as a ""global wake-up call"".Mr Corbyn said millions of people in the US and UK feel ""left behind"" and ""marginalised"" by the current economic system - something Mr Trump had tapped into during the election campaign.""There is deep anger at a political elite that doesn't listen,"" he said.""But instead of offering real solutions or the resources to make them work, he offered only someone to blame - everyone that is apart for those actually responsible for the broken economy or the failed political system. ""That's Trump in his election campaign in the USA. Now cross that Atlantic to here. The Tories do exactly the same.""The Labour leader said the US and UK electorate both feel left behind by a economic system that makes them work harder while rewarding a small elite.He told supporters the UK will be unable to ""take back control"" by simply leaving the EU and instead needed to ""take on corporate vested interests"".The Conservatives have ""opened the door to UKIP and fanned the flames of fear"", he added. ""Theresa May as home secretary fed the idea that immigration was the real problem, made promises she knew she couldn't deliver about slashing numbers,"" he said. ""And she whipped up hate with those notorious go home vans. No wonder she didn't even temper her welcome to Donald Trump.""She has used the same strategy herself - if delivered with a more refined voice.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Jeremy Corbyn presides over a Labour Party that is divided, divisive and utterly out of step with the concerns of ordinary working people.""Labour would bankrupt our country like they did last time, erode our armed forces, making us less safe - and they also don't think there should be any limits on immigration at all."""

She told the BBC she wanted to ""flush out"" companies abusing existing rules and ""nudge them into better behaviour"".Briefing notes from her department also suggested they could be required to ""be clear about the proportion of their workforce which is international"", a practice which the Home Office said was standard in the US.Defence Secretary Michael Fallon later clarified that, if the plan went ahead, it would mean firms providing numbers overall rather than individual names.But, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Analysis, Mr Prouza, the Czech Republic's state secretary for European affairs, said: ""I think the performance at the Conservative Party conference was again stoking the fires. ""When you had all these ideas of British companies that would have to report the number of foreigners they employ, maybe even the names of the foreigners they employ, that is very similar to what we have seen on the continent in the 1930s.""I think we all remember what it led to. So I think we see it as very dangerous and I was really hoping that Prime Minister May would condemn these ideas very quickly and it's not happened. So that is a worry.""A UK government spokesman said: ""There is no plan to list foreign workers and never has been. The proportion of international workers in a company is one of the pieces of information that companies may be asked to provide to the government. This information will not be published. ""This already happens in the US and is one of several proposals we will be consulting on as part of our work to ensure that companies take reasonable steps to recruit at home before looking to bring in workers from abroad. ""The purpose of having a consultation is so that we can listen to business and use that feedback to inform our decisions"".Racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales increased by 41% in the month after June's EU referendum, according to Home Office figures.It said the sharp increase had declined in August but had ""remained at a higher level than prior to the EU referendum"".Mr Prouza said: ""At the moment we need to support the security of Czechs. We've seen an enormous increase in attacks on Czechs and other foreigners on British soil.""We've had dozens and dozens of people complaining to the Czech embassy in London, sharing their negative experiences in places where they have lived for five or 10 years and never had a problem.""In the last six months there is more and more of these issues."" Mr Prouza said that, in a recent conversation with Mrs May, Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka had told her: ""We would really like to see the British government doing something about these xenophobic, nationalistic attacks.""Ms Rudd has said: ""We should be able to have a conversation about the skills we need.""I don't think we should have a situation where we can't talk about immigration. ""We must not ignore the fact that people want to talk about immigration and if we do talk about immigration, don't call me a racist.""

2016-11-12,Mothers 'missing out' on pension rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20161113023916/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37951066,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTens of thousands of parents - and mothers in particular - are in danger of missing out on some of their state pension rights, according to a study.The research, for Royal London Insurance, suggests that as many as 38,000 women from high-earning families could be affected.Royal London said that mothers have lost £278m in eventual pension rights in the last two years alone.The reason is that they have decided to stop claiming child benefit.Stay-at-home mothers who claim the payments are given national insurance (NI) credits towards their pension, as if they were still at work.But since January 2013, any parent earning more than £60,000 has had to pay all their child benefit back to the government, through the tax system.As a result, some people are no longer bothering to claim it in the first place.""It is vital that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) takes action to ensure that these women get the national insurance credits which should be theirs by right,"" said Steve Webb, policy director at Royal London, and a former pensions minister in the coalition government.""Otherwise the cause of gender equality in state pensions will have been set back a generation,"" he added.A parent who has not claimed child benefit for the last two years could lose £231 a year when he or she comes to receive their state pension, according to Royal London.In response, an HMRC spokesman said families had always been able to submit a child benefit claim form to help protect their future right to the state pension. ""We provide specific information to all new mothers and on gov.uk,"" said a spokesman.""If anyone is worried about their national insurance record, they can contact HMRC at any time to check how many years of credits and contributions they have built up.""The issue will not affect all mothers who do not claim child benefit. Women who previously claimed it, and then stopped doing so, are protected by transitional arrangements.""It is reassuring that there are transitional rules to keep the half a million stay-at-home parents in the system who were already getting child benefit when the rules changed and who then opted out,"" said Jon Greer, pension expert at Old Mutual Wealth.""However, over time those people will become the minority."" Others will be able to make up their NI credits by returning to work. To claim the new state pension in full, workers need to have 35 years of NI contributions.Those who are affected are being advised to claim child benefit at the ""Nil rate"", by completing the form Child Benefit: CH2."

The LGA blamed cuts by the government to councils' budgets.The Department for Transport said it was working with local transport companies to improve services and boost the use of buses.In Britain last year, there were three times as many journeys taken on bus than on trains.But the LGA - which represents councils in England and Wales - found the number of miles driven by council-subsidised buses in England (excluding London) dropped by 12% last year.It says local authorities have been diverting money from subsidised bus services to fund the gap in the Concessionary Fares Scheme, which councils have a statutory duty to provide. The scheme gives pensioners and disabled people in England free off-peak travel on all local bus services anywhere in England.In Whittington in Lancashire, the number of buses has reduced from 111 a week to five - all of which are school buses.Duncan Foster told BBC Radio 4's Today the situation was so bad he resorted to hitch-hiking from the bus stop in a hi-visibility jacket. and said it was ""a sad state of affairs"".""Virtually anyone living in Whittington is obliged to have the use of a car and people have to rely on local taxis now to go to hospital appointments,"" he said.""I know an elderly gentleman who had to go to hospital quite regularly had to leave the village. One or two other people don't appear to be able to get out anymore.""The company which ran the buses stopped doing it because they weren't being subsidised, and the local authority says it hasn't got the money to keep subsidising them and that is down to the government.""But the government have millions or billions to run HS2 trains, and our bus costs would be pennies compared to that,"" he added.LGA transport spokesman Martin Tett said the figures show ""just how much pressure many local bus services are under"".He added it was paramount the government fully funds the Concessionary Fares Scheme in the Autumn Statement.Mr Tett said: ""Years of underfunding of the scheme has forced councils to spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to subsidise the scheme.""This is now impossible with councils having to make savings while struggling to protect vital services like adult social care, protecting children, filling potholes and collecting bins.""The Department for Transport said it wanted to see services thrive, particularly in rural areas.A spokesman said: ""While decisions on funding for local bus routes are a matter for local authorities, we provide around £250m to support services every year, serving local communities up and down the country.""Our Bus Services Bill will give councils powers to work in partnership with local transport companies to improve the service passengers can expect and boost bus use."""

Discussed America's longstanding and close relationship with the UK.""BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale noted that the US vice president-elect had opted not to use the phrase ""special relationship"". Mr Johnson, who last year suggested that Mr Trump had been ""out of his mind"" for suggesting a ban on Muslims entering the US, has insisted the UK should be optimistic about the future following Mr Trump's victory.At a news conference on Thursday, before speaking to Mr Pence, he said it was time to be ""overwhelmingly positive about the possibilities"" of a Trump presidency and described the US president-elect as a ""deal maker"".""I believe that this is a great opportunity for us in the UK to build on that relationship with America that is of fundamental economic importance to us, but also, great importance for the stability and prosperity of the world,"" Mr Johnson said.""I would respectfully say to my beloved European friends and colleagues that it's time that we snapped out of the general doom and gloom about the result of this election and collective whinge-o-rama that seems to be going on in some places.""But former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I don't think Donald Trump quite yet knows what the pressures will be on him when he becomes president.""We've seen that when he feels slighted, when he feels criticised, he reacts quite fiercely. If you translate that into global affairs it could have consequences which are dangerous for everyone.""Sir John said one of the failures of President Obama's administration had been managing relations with Russia: ""We're getting back into a world which is quite dangerous, and I think that is the biggest threat.""Meanwhile Downing Street has rejected claims that ministers will be forced to use Nigel Farage as a ""go-between"" with the Trump administration.The Daily Telegraph reported ministers would have to seek the advice of UKIP's interim leader because they have no links to the president-elect. But sources close to the prime minister told the BBC that Mr Trump, who defeated Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, favoured a relationship with Theresa May as close as that of former UK and US leaders Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.Mr Trump invited Mrs May to visit Washington, during a phone call on Thursday in which both stressed the importance of UK-US relations. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says Downing Street has been ""hugely irritated"" with the claim ministers were seeking the services of Mr Farage in forging links with the Trump administration. A source close to Mr Farage made it clear that he had no intention of working with Conservative ministers."

With the support of Conservative MPs and the support or abstention of most Labour MPs, the bill is well placed to pass through the Commons.But the opposition of some MPs is likely to embolden critics in the House of Lords.The Liberal Democrats have long called for a referendum on the outcome of the government's negotiations with EU, but only now have they said they will definitely vote against Article 50 if their demand is not met.Mr Farron, whose party has eight MPs in the Commons, told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""Article 50 would proceed but only if there is a referendum on the terms of the deal and if the British people are not respected then, yes, that is a red line and we would vote against the government.""For Labour, shadow minister Catherine West, former leadership contender Owen Smith and south London MP Helen Hayes all made clear they were prepared to vote against Article 50 - which begins formal exit negotiations with the EU - if amendments were not accepted.Former Labour minister David Lammy and shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner have said they would oppose Article 50. Opposition whip Thangam Debbonaire said she would also vote against it, if a vote were held imminently. The SNP's 54 MPs may join them. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said they will not vote for anything that undermines the will of the Scottish people, and has previously said they will vote against a bill to write EU provisions into British law to prepare for Brexit.Dulwich Labour MP Hayes said she was prepared to defy Labour whips to oppose the measure unless the government promised a second referendum.She said: ""I had somebody in my surgery last week who was in tears because of Brexit and I see genuine distress amongst my constituents about what this path means. ""I would not be representing them if I voted to trigger Article 50 on the basis of no information from the government about the path that they would then take us on.""In posts on Twitter and Facebook earlier this week, shadow Foreign Office minister Catherine West wrote: ""As I have said before, I stand with the people of Hornsey & Wood Green, and I will vote against Brexit in Parliament."" Owen Smith confirmed to Today that if his bid for a second referendum failed, he was likely to oppose the bill.The SDLP's three MPs will also oppose the measure.Ministers said MPs voting against Article 50 would effectively be trying to re-run the referendum in the hope of a ""different answer"".""Parliament voted by a margin of six to one to put the decision on whether to remain in or leave the EU in the hands of the British people,"" said Brexit minister David Jones.""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to respect the outcome of the referendum and make a success of Brexit.""Last week the High Court ruled Parliament must be consulted about leaving the European Union.Unless the Supreme Court overturns the judgement in December, a bill to invoke Article 50 is expected in the new year.Labour made clear its official position would be not to frustrate the process of leaving the EU after a newspaper report said the party leader Jeremy Corbyn intended to force a general election unless ministers caved in to demands. After the story broke Labour sources said that while it would seek to amend the bill, it would provide ""unconditional"" support.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would not frustrate the process and would not vote down Article 50.However, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will try to amend the bill in the House of Lords. So too will one Conservative peer - Baroness Wheatcroft."

They cite Donald Trump's election as US president as a motivation to ""assist the struggle to transform Labour"". The internal battle with the Militant tendency faction was one of Labour's biggest controversies of the 1980s.Mr Taaffe, who was expelled from Labour in 1983, said: ""We want to play our part in the struggle to transform Labour and urge the National Executive Committee to aid this process by admitting us, and others who have been similarly expelled or excluded, into membership.""Mr Taaffe, now the general secretary of the Socialist Party, was expelled along with ex-MP Mr Nellist - now the chairman of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC).Their affiliations with Labour rivals mean it appears unlikely that their applications to rejoin the party will be approved.A Labour spokeswoman told the BBC: ""It is against Labour's rules to be a member of another political party or organisation which has its own programme, principles and policy, or distinctive and separate propaganda, and which is therefore ineligible for affiliation to the party.""The application comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was caught up in a row over warnings of Trotskyist entryism from deputy leader Tom Watson.In August 2016, shortly before Mr Corbyn's successful re-election as leader, Mr Watson wrote to him saying ""It's not a conspiracy theory to say that members of [Militant] are joining Labour. It's a fact.""The Labour leader told The Observer his deputy was talking ""nonsense"", saying: ""I just ask Tom to do the maths - 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. ""At no stage in anyone's most vivid imagination are there 300,000 sectarian extremists at large in the country who have suddenly descended on the Labour party.""The 75 expelled Labour members have pitched their application directly at Mr Corbyn, saying his re-election in September ""marked the beginning of a new struggle against a capitalist establishment""Their statement continued: ""We want to play our part in seeing that struggle through to victory."""

UKIP has not yet selected its candidate - leadership contender Suzanne Evans and Victoria Ayling are thought to be in the running.Conservative Stephen Phillips resigned last week, citing ""irreconcilable policy differences"" with the government.The barrister and part-time judge had complained that the government was ""lurching to the right"" and had criticised its attempt to trigger Article 50, beginning the formal process for the UK to leave the EU, without a vote by MPs. The High Court has since ruled that the government must consult MPs - although ministers are appealing against the decision to the Supreme Court.Dr Johnson, who is married with three children, said she was delighted to be selected, adding: ""I am the only person who can support the prime minister and the government to deliver Brexit. I am completely behind the government's plans for Brexit and to deliver on the decision made by the British people.""Mr Clarke, a trade unionist and former postman, said he was honoured to fight the seat for Labour and would stand up for locals in Parliament.""It is not right that in 2016 working people here in Sleaford and North Hykeham are having to choose between heating and eating.""He accused the government of having ""no plan for Brexit"" and pledged to ""hold the government to account on ensuring the best deal for Britain, which protects our local jobs"".Lincolnshire voters were among the most Eurosceptic in the UK, with more than 75% of voters in Boston voting to leave.Local councillor Mark Suffield is standing as an independent while Peter Hill is standing for the Monster Raving Loony Party.

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "

2016-11-12,India unmoved,https://web.archive.org//web/20161113023916/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37950198,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe prime minister seemed pleased with the outcome of her trade visit to India. Theresa May said the 33-strong delegation had sealed deals worth £1bn, laying the groundwork for more than 1,300 jobs in the UK.Mrs May even donned a sari on a visit to a Hindu temple in the southern city of Bangalore, mixing the traditional with the modern. Bangalore has now become an important IT base for many other countries.Yet in India, they're not so sure. Her reception was polite, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi granting her an unusually long meeting of 90 minutes, but there are now significant tensions in the relationship which three days of photo opportunities will not resolve.Lord Bilimoria, the Indian-born businessman who created Cobra beer, has been on many of these trade trips stretching back 20 years, with both Conservative and Labour prime ministers.On The World This Weekend on Radio 4, he told me that Indian companies had invested more in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. They've seen it as the bridge to the EU. As a result of Brexit, that bridge is about to be broken, so having good links with the UK will become less important.That means India could, in future, see Britain as a less essential trade partner, just as the UK needs its enormous market even more.The problem is exacerbated by British decisions about immigration. The treatment of Indians who have studied in the UK and want to remain, and those who come as tourists or to work, rankles the Indian government. It's Mrs May herself who's blamed. At the Home Office, she presided over an increasingly restrictive policy, in contrast with the Cameron government's treatment of wealthy Chinese, who have seen many obstacles to their entry removed.Leaving Europe could improve the situation. As home secretary, Mrs May cut back on non-EU migration, to try to meet the challenging target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands of people. She's powerless to cut the numbers of citizens from other EU countries coming to the UK. Post-Brexit, she could spread the reduction more evenly.As president of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, Lord Bilimoria told me that a particular source of tension is over the treatment of students. ""The reality is Theresa May - when she was home secretary - did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration,"" he told me. ""We continue to include international students within our net migration figures,"" he added. ""The perception that sends out to the rest of the world, including India, is Britain wants to reduce the number of international students.""In that, the policy has been successful, with numbers falling from 40,000 to 20,000 in the last five years. Successful in British terms, perhaps, but Lord Bilmoria says, not to Indians. ""Theresa May as home secretary is the one who said that: 'I want international students to leave the day they graduate.' And the headlines in India at that time were: 'Take our money and then get out.'""In our interview, Lord Bilimoria revealed to me that last year David Cameron, then the prime minister, had suggested policy was about to change. ""David Cameron… told me personally in November: 'Karan, I think we should take international students out of the net migration figures.' It didn't happen.""  Whether he changed his mind, or lost a battle within Cabinet, the Indian government was very disappointed that no such announcement ever came.Nor did it this time. Theresa May did propose speeding up the application process for India's businesspeople, but said other changes would only be considered if the deportation of Indians who had overstayed their welcome in the UK could be speeded up.As for students, she said they were welcome, and pointed out that nine out of 10 student applicants did receive a visa. That may be true, but are there as many applications as there were in the past?Currency questions have been distracting Indians in the days since her visit, after the dramatic decision to cancel the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. So the average man or woman in India may not yet have fully absorbed Mrs May's visa resistance.There are reasons, then, to doubt how quickly India will want to reach a trade deal when Brexit happens. Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was optimistic that Britain's partners in the world outside the EU would jump at the chance, observing: ""We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen, and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny civil service. ""Are we really unable to do trade deals?""I quoted that to the Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suggesting that India would therefore be better disposed towards Britain than to some other countries. ""Well, I thought so and most of us in India thought so; but we aren't being treated as old friends any longer. It's a tight professional engagement,"" she said.In such relationships, calls to old loyalties or sentiment don't count for very much.You can hear The World This Weekend on Sunday lunchtimes at 13:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4, and via the BBC iPlayer."
2016-11-12,New era,https://web.archive.org//web/20161113023916/http://www.bbc.com/news/37949669,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkRemember when politics was rather dull? When across the West the electoral pendulum swung reliably between parties of the centre left and centre right? There was consensus about the benefits of a global market economy. Politicians seemed to talk the same way, wear the same ties, parrot the same stale slogans. Meanwhile voters got on with shopping, and turning out at elections in ever decreasing numbers. This seemed to be the condition of liberal democracy at the start of 2016. But the seedbed for Brexit and Trump was there. As politics became the preserve of a professional office-seeking class the old parties shrank. Popular indifference and distrust of politics grew. A few years ago the political scientist Peter Mair argued that Western democracy was being hollowed out. With one referendum and a presidential election, liberal democracy as we've known it seems finally, dramatically, to have collapsed in on itself. Too hyperbolic? In response to Donald Trump's victory, the authoritarian, anti-immigration Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, said it was ""great news"" and claimed his victory marked the end of a period of ""liberal non-democracy"". This is the same Viktor Orban who was greeted with a mock-Nazi salute by the president of the European Commission at a summit last year. ""The dictator is coming,"" quipped Jean-Claude Juncker. Now many Western leaders are sweating. Last month the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the West's political values were in danger of breaking down. What does he think those values are? ""Human rights, civil liberties, including the freedom of speech and religion, free market and a competitive economy based on private property, reasonable and fair redistribution of goods, restrictions on power resulting from rules and tradition, tolerance and political pluralism."" Mr Tusk said those who questioned liberal democracy were happy about Brexit, looked up to President Putin and supported Donald Trump. And it's true that from the coffee shops of Brooklyn to the bistros of Brussels there is a sense of melancholy and foreboding. For people who have enjoyed the political stability and economic opportunities delivered by decades of liberal democracy these are bewildering, unsettling times. ""How"", they ask, ""can Britain possibly have voted to leave the EU?"" Millions of despairing Americans are grappling with the prospect of President Donald Trump. ""Is Le Pen next?"" they fret in the cafes of Paris. But for voters who cast ballots for Brexit and Donald Trump it feels like politics has finally listened to them. The ""left behind"" economic narrative does not account for the full variety of forces behind this new populism. But in the view of Parag Khanna, an American professor in Singapore and author of the new book Connectography, 2016 will be remembered as the year that ""the global underclass revolt crystallised in the form of the Brexit and the Trump election"".""This uncoordinated movement really began with Occupy Wall Street and has now claimed its biggest scalp,"" he says.Prof Vernon Bogdanor, at King's College London, agrees. ""There is a division between the exam-passing classes who are not hostile to the global elite and the left behind who are nationalist and protectionist,"" he says.""It takes different forms in different countries but it's now a fairly common phenomenon in Europe and America.""Prof Bogdanor tells me the new political cleavage is not between left and right but between nationalist populism and those perceived as ""elites"". And he is worried.""The election of Donald Trump is the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It's not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s. We're seeing a pale imitation of what we saw then"", he says, while careful to make clear he doesn't consider the president-elect a fascist. But Claire Fox, the director of the Institute of Ideas, thinks the vitality of liberal democracy has been proved by the Brexit and Trump results. ""We have to be careful of an anti-democratic response to perfectly legitimate democratic votes. Quite a lot of liberals are saying, 'well, democracy is not working so well because people are voting in a way we don't want them to vote', which strikes me as a supreme irony."" A suffocating political and cultural consensus has driven the backlash we are seeing now, she believes. ""There has been arguably far less tolerance over the last 10 years for anyone who doesn't agree with what a particular elite outlook is - and a silence or demonising of people who don't go along with the narrative."" Ms Fox cites public concern about immigration as a prime example and she also takes exception to the suggestion liberal democracy is being threatened by an ugly authoritarianism. ""The whole of the establishment, from army generals to big business, lined up to say Brexit was a mistake,"" she argues. ""What's authoritarian is employers turning round to their workers and saying jobs would be lost. ""We had an elite who thought they could call a referendum, mobilise everybody who should go and vote as they were told. That's caused a massive tantrum amongst the elite who then have the nerve to say it's the people's fault for threatening democracy.""Whether or not this political upheaval should be celebrated or feared, it feels like a rupture with the past. We are rumbling over an important set of points with little idea where we are heading. Brexit and Trump promised political control to people who felt their lives had little of it, who were furious at the gulf between their political rulers and the governed and mourned the social cohesion of the past, and whose voices were not heard much in the media. In the raucous, angry echo chamber of social media a fight back brewed. The flipside seems to be growing intolerance of pluralism and difference. That is why people like Donald Tusk anxiously wonder how Western liberal democracy can respond and survive. Because there is nothing inevitable about its continuity. As author and political philosopher John Gray wrote recently, plenty of authoritarian regimes in the world are doing well. The middle class in Russia appears wedded to a combination of consumerism and nationalism and in China many want nothing more than rising living standards and freedom in their private lives. ""Liberal societies cannot depend on history for their survival,"" he says in a New Statesman article. ""They need to defend themselves."" At the moment however, the winners from globalisation and the political elites have lost and the dissenters have won. "
2016-11-12,Voter revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20161113023916/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUS voters have delivered a blow to the political establishment by electing outsider Donald Trump to the presidency, much like UK voters did earlier this year when they opted to leave the EU. But just how close are the parallels between Tuesday's result and June's referendum? Were the voters who gave Mr Trump his victory much the same as those who voted to leave the EU? For many on this side of the Atlantic, there was a strong sense of deja vu on Tuesday night as it gradually emerged that Donald Trump has pulled off a dramatic victory. It all seemed reminiscent of the drama that British voters had experienced when in the small hours of 24 June it became apparent that a majority had voted to leave the European Union.One reason of course was that neither result had been expected. In the UK most - though not all - polls put Remain narrowly ahead. In the US most - though again not quite all - polls put Hillary Clinton narrowly in the lead. Read carefully, neither set of polls could in fact be said to point to a clear winner, but most commentators had convinced themselves that Remain and Mrs Clinton respectively would emerge victorious.But another arguably more important reason for the sense of deja vu was the similarity between some of Donald Trump's key campaign messages and those of the Leave campaign. Both majored on concerns about immigration. Both questioned whether the existing global financial order necessarily benefitted the ordinary man in the street. And both portrayed themselves as the underdogs campaigning against an allegedly complacent and out of touch political establishment.In the UK these stances have been shown to appeal in particular to the so-called ""left behind"", that is, voters who feel they have lost out economically in recent years and who are uncomfortable with some of the social changes that have been going on around them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was remarkably successful in such mid-West Rust Belt states as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, where the decline of manufacturing industry has seemingly created a part of America that can also be said to have been ""left behind"". There are certainly some striking similarities between the UK and US voting trends. To begin with, older voters in the UK were inclined to vote to leave the EU, whereas a majority of younger voters were in favour of remaining, according to exit poll data. Similarly, in the US Mrs Clinton was ahead among younger voters, while Mr Trump was more likely to be preferred by older citizens.At the same time, an educational divide was apparent in both ballots. In the UK, polls suggested a majority of university graduates were keen on remaining in the EU, while those without a degree voted to leave. Equally, in the US, exit polls indicate college graduates were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton, whereas those who were not college graduates inclined towards Donald Trump.Moreover, this educational divide was one of the most remarkable features of the US election. Republican candidates do not usually do better among non-graduates than graduates. In 2012 the level of support for the then-Republican standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, was almost exactly the same in the two groups. Here perhaps is the strongest evidence that Mr Trump's campaign messages had a particular resonance for a certain section of the US population that might also be described as ""left behind"".However, perhaps the analogy should not be pushed too far. A closer look at graphic above reveals that the education divide in the EU referendum was rather sharper than that in the US election.In the UK the gap was wide - around three-fifths of graduates voted to remain, while 63% of non-graduates cast a vote for leaving. In the US it was more nuanced - only just over half of college graduates voted for Mrs Clinton and only just over half of non-graduates backed Mr Trump.Moreover, in other respects the claim that it was the ""left behind"" who took Mr Trump to victory does not match the evidence.  In the UK those who voted to leave often had few, if any, educational qualifications, but also tended to be on lower incomes. Around two-thirds of those with incomes of less than £20,000 ($25,000) a year voted to leave, while around three in five of those earning more than £40,000 ($50,000) backed staying in the EU.But Mr Trump was not particularly successful among low-income voters. In fact, just over half of those with incomes of less than $30,000 (£24,000) voted for Mrs Clinton. Conversely, those on more than $100,000 (£80,000) a year only preferred Mr Trump by the narrowest margins. Mr Trump's campaign messages may have enabled him to reach out to voters with few, if any, qualifications for whom social issues such as immigration are often a particular concern. However, it appears he was less successful at mobilising support among those who might be thought to be economically left behind.There are other parallels between the vote in the US and that in the UK too, though in the case of the US at least they reflect political differences that long predate Mr Trump. The Republican president-elect was well ahead among white voters, but trailed Mrs Clinton heavily amongst the remainder of America's increasingly diverse population. In the UK too, black and minority ethnic voters were disinclined to vote to leave, put off perhaps by the Leave campaign's focus on the issue of immigration.Meanwhile, evangelical Protestants once again turned out for the Republican nominee in very strong numbers, while those who do not profess any religion at all voted heavily for Mrs Clinton.In the UK, too, those who do not claim to belong to any religion - a much larger group than in the US - were inclined to vote to remain. However, the religious divide in the UK largely reflects the fact that younger voters are more likely not to claim some kind of religious identity, rather than having much to do with their religious outlook itself.US elections have also long been marked by a gender difference, with women being more likely to vote Democrat, men to support the Republicans. That, too, was also in evidence on Thursday. That was one divide that was not evident at all in the UK referendum - men and women voted in much the same way. It seems that Mr Trump still has much to learn from UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, now UK foreign secretary, when it comes to wooing women voters.

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."
2016-11-12,Two of a kind?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161113023916/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922961,"""It'll be Brexit plus plus plus!"" said Donald Trump. It was. If Brexit felt like a political earthquake, the election of this populist president was off the seismic scale, the continental plates shifting underneath the country which has defined our modern world.Obama had that poster - ""Hope"" in cool colours. Trump paints in brasher, bolder strokes. His triumph is a release of pent-up anger but it is still about that same yearning for a change. Make no mistake. This victory, like Brexit, gives a new hope for a better future to those who backed it - and their aspirations and expectations will be sky high. Both left the political establishment, not to mention the pollsters, reeling in shock. I am glad on this occasion I had been telling everyone who'd listen, that after last June's Brexit shock and the UK General Election's surprise I just didn't trust the polls. After all if people were ""shy"" of admitting they backed David Cameron how much more bashful would they feel in declaring for Trump? My gut feeling was that he would win. In my five years in the US I'd seen the frustration and fury mounting.It is perhaps ironic that our two countries, with a reputation for stable political systems, have delivered political revolutions of such importance. Or perhaps it's not. Perhaps their stability and strength is they can cope with popular revolts, without pitchforks or getting blood all over our sans culottes.  The wave of populism all over the West has already delivered a very right-wing government in Hungary, and a very left-wing one in Greece. For years there has been a mounting mood, a disconnect between politicians and people which finds expression in a search for politics outside the old norms. Those of us who've been urging people to pay attention to these movements shouldn't now gloat about our foresight but ask hard questions about the political response, from left, right and centre.There's no doubt the election of the 45th president and Brexit have similar roots. But word of caution for both sides of the Atlantic - voters are individuals, and this is a mood, not a party programme. As Trump put it, not a campaign but ""a great movement"". People who voted for either revolution may share some of the concerns outlined below, but not others. Indeed, if there was a simple root cause it wouldn't be so powerful.Be cautious about the theory this is all about the ""left behinds"" - older, poorly-educated white workers disposed by globalisation, the children and grandchildren of the rust belt. It is not wrong, but it is not sufficient. Those whose jobs have gone to Mexico and China, those who did well-paid jobs undercut by immigration, are indeed of a mood against neoliberalism and globalisation. But that is a simple story about the economy that doesn't quite do justice to the complexity of the last 30 years.  In today's economy many more than just the disposed working class feel left out. The gap between the very rich and the rest widens, bills and insecurity pile up, but neither their prospects nor the economy grows apace. It isn't getting any better.Few politicians dare tell them that increased automation may take more jobs than immigrants. You can't deport a driverless truck. Nevertheless, the fears of the economic and cultural effects of immigration looms very large.Behind it lurk worries about an insecurity about identity. While some feel at home in Beijing, Berlin or Birmingham, others no longer feel at home in their home. I'll be interested to see if the detailed breakdown proves me wrong but, let's face it, it doesn't seem to be economically insecure black or Hispanic voters who backed The Donald.If the UK has very similar concerns there is an added component in the US. Either because of its history of civil war and slavery, there's little doubt race is a critical factor - some whites feel that America is no longer their property - because it isn't. Another difference. In the US the evangelical Christian right, very concerned about abortion and changing sexual morality, is a force we don't have in the UK. But in both countries distaste for the liberal elite goes hand in hand with a despair at a government that is seemingly unresponsive and out of touch. This is very much stronger in the States than here, when Washington is almost a swear word, where a gridlocked Congress has frozen most attempts to get things done.  The American system was designed to be slow, and block change unless it is consensual (itself arguably a legacy of slavery). But that system feels broken, dysfunctional, almost beyond repair. And here's my own hobby horse - while American elections are ideal reality TV, the nuts and bolts of democratic politics can seem almost quaint in an internet age of huge choice.When we can change our mortgage or our energy company at the click of a mouse, voting for one of two bundles of policies every four or five years seems curiously sluggish. I wrote last week that if Donald Trump was seen as a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, it was worth remembering that people bought that patent medicine because every other remedy had failed.As one European central banker said recently, people sway the bridge because it no longer seems a way of crossing the river. The volume of articles peering behind the populism will grow. But we need people who change the world, rather than describe it.  We need to hear coherently and urgently from those on every side of the debate. Those who support globalisation and immigration need to step up to the plate and be more specific about the benefits of their project. Those, like Theresa May, who seem to accept part of the populist message must be urged to spell out how they square the circle of a linked world economy of free trade with answering concerns about industrial policy and identity. And, of course, those who caustically and brilliantly articulate the concerns need to develop solutions.The president-elect has a few months to work out how to turn a howl of anguish into effective policy. No doubt along with a few good soundbites. From anguish to hope to relief is a long journey.Some members of the US establishment argue that Donald Trump can be contained or that, having achieved his aim, the brutal rhetoric will be ditched, he won't really build a wall, ban Muslims, deport millions of illegal immigrants or make the Middle Eastern desert glow. That may be so. He will be a hero for a good while and the outrage of liberals, combined with his brutalist charisma, will be a bulwark against criticism from his own side, for a while. But he must be aware the hard right cherish myths of betrayal and  it will, after a while, swoop like a hawk on any backsliding.  There is a deeper danger. At the heart of his presidency will be how he deals with immigration and the economy. Anyone who has travelled America's roads and rails and used its airports will understand Trump's call for massive investment in infrastructure. Such a Keynesian stimulus would provide ""shovel ready"" jobs for the dispossessed. But it is hard to see where the cash would come from, if he is curbing Americans' overspending, and drastically cutting taxation. Similarly, there could be strains in the Trump coalition between those who want a radically smaller government and one that sticks its oar into big companies and banks. The biggest questions will be about his character and control. But his supporters may relish the occasional outburst. But the real lesson of this election is the breadth and depth of his ambition. Remember, in reality Obama was very cautious and promised very little. Trump has promised the moon by comparison. If he delivers it he will be a transformative figure who we have all underestimated. If he fails, there will still be millions of angry, disillusioned Americans still searching for hope."

2016-11-12,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161113023916/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

2016-11-13,Miliband rejects call for another EU vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37968121,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEd Miliband has rejected calls for another referendum on Britain's EU membership. The former Labour leader told ITV's Peston on Sunday June's Leave vote must be respected and there was ""no question"" of the UK staying put. Some Labour and Lib Dem MPs have said they will oppose starting formal Brexit talks unless ministers promise a subsequent vote on the eventual deal. Mr Miliband also called for curbs on freedom of movement rules in the UK. The government is appealing against a High Court ruling which stated that it must seek the consent of Parliament before it triggers Article 50 - the mechanism by which member states leave the EU.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said his party will not seek to ""frustrate"" the Article 50 process but several of his MPs have said they will oppose it if a vote is held in the House of Commons early next year. While supporting calls for a parliamentary vote on Article 50, Mr Miliband said he did not agree with MPs threatening to withhold their support unless certain conditions were met.Despite sympathising with the 48% of Remain voters who felt ""angry and frustrated"" by the outcome, he said the result could not be overturned. ""We had a referendum and we've got to respect the result. We are leaving the EU.""Mr Miliband said his focus was on getting the government to reveal more details about its plans and that a parliamentary vote was the best way to do that. But he suggested a vote against Article 50 could make the prospect of a ""hard Brexit"" - a phrase which assumes the UK will leave the single market as well as the EU - more likely.""If we cede the field and we say 'we're the people who want to reverse the result', then there are two choices in Britain: hard, destructive Brexit, or reversing the result. I know what's going to win - hard Brexit's going to win.""Asked if he agreed with the UKIP leader Nigel Farage that anything other than ""hard Brexit"" - the UK exiting the European single market as well as the EU - would be ""a betrayal"", Mr Miliband said: ""Nigel Farage might be our liaison with Donald Trump, but he doesn't get to decide UK government policy as far as I know.""He continued: ""The reality is there are lots of different modes for Britain outside the EU. There's Norway, there's Switzerland, there's Turkey in the customs union outside the single market.""Mr Miliband's comments bring him into conflict with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, who has demanded a second referendum on the terms of the final settlement agreed, describing this as a ""red line"" for his party's MPs and peers. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour would hold the government to account during parliamentary debates on Article 50 but not stand in the way of invoking it.""We will respect the referendum,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""Therefore, there is going to be a departure from the European Union.""We will demand that we have market access, workers' protection, consumer protection, environmental protection, justice issues through the European Court.""In the ITV interview, Mr Miliband also said the current unrestricted right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK would have to come to an end - a stance that potentially puts him at odds with his successor Jeremy Corbyn.""If you are asking me should we carry on with free movement as was, I don't think we should. I do think in the Brexit negotiations we have got to look for change in terms of free movement.""One of the things from the referendum is that free movement cannot carry on exactly as it did before.""The government has said it wants controls on freedom of movement, something EU leaders have said would be incompatible with continued membership of the single market."

The incoming US president has spoken to Theresa May by phone and there have been other contacts between ministers and representatives of the incoming administration.Mr Farage, who campaigned alongside Mr Trump during the election, suggested that many British politicians, including some close to Theresa May, had been ""quite rude"" about him during his ascent to power and now must re-think their attitudes.""I do think that just too many members of this government said too many nasty things about the President-elect, and I think there has to be a mending of fences,"" he said.There were huge opportunities to be had in ""Brexit Britain"", Mr Farage said, and Donald Trump would be a much more accommodating partner than his predecessor Barack Obama - who he suggested had ""damaged"" the relationship between both countries. Mr Farage told the BBC that there were some cabinet ministers who were open to the idea of his acting as a go-between with the president-elect, but said that Downing Street was more concerned with ""saying I'm irrelevant"".He called on the government to work closely with Mr Trump, saying: ""There's a real opportunity here.""""Not only President-elect Trump, but his whole team is Anglophile. ""They like our country, they recognise what we've done together in the past, and they're coming into this with an incredibly positive view. We need to seize the day.""Mr Farage denied that he would seek to work within Mr Trump's administration, saying: ""I'm not an American citizen, I'm not going to be getting a job with his team any time soon.""It's the image that encapsulates politics in 2016. President-elect Trump, in an open necked shirt, smiles, giving the thumbs up gesture. He's stood, shoulder to shoulder, with Nigel Farage in front of a glitzy, golden backdrop inside Trump Tower in New York. Outsiders, who faced scorn and ridicule, they stand together now as winners. To be anti-establishment now is to be mainstream. The two men, catalysts for political convulsions on both sides of the Atlantic, discussed ""freedom and winning,"" UKIP sources said. Their meeting was an embarrassment for Downing Street and stellar political theatre - but perhaps only that. Nigel Farage knows Mr Trump, but wields no power. The challenge for the UK government now is to build bridges with a new American administration it didn't want, and didn't expect to win.Mr Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the US at the end of 2015 led to a debate in Parliament on whether he should be barred from the UK while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, said Mr Trump must be ""out of his mind"".Mr Trump's spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway said Saturday's meeting between the two men in Trump Tower had been ""very productive"" and that they had talked about ""freedom and winning and what all this means for the world"".Mr Farage, who said Mr Trump ""was relaxed, and full of good ideas"", had joked on the way to the encounter that he was ""just a tourist"".A UKIP spokesman had previously confirmed that Mr Farage asked Mr Trump to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House Oval Office. Mr Farage said he had been ""especially pleased"" by Mr Trump's ""very positive reaction"" to the idea.A UKIP source said the meeting, held on 12 November, had ""made the prime minister look very foolish"".Mrs May plans to visit Mr Trump in the first three months of next year after his inauguration.The prime minister has said she hopes the two will be able to work on areas of mutual interest to enhance the special relationship between the two countries although some have said the government has no links with the Trump camp and will have to ""start from scratch"".Crispin Blunt, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, described as ""completely implausible"" the idea that Mr Farage would have an ambassadorial role in a Trump administration, telling the BBC there was ""no need for Nigel"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he understood the appeal of Mr Trump's rhetoric to people angry at being ""left behind"" by globalisation but he said the president-elect needed to ""grow up"" when it came to his views on immigration.Mr Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, said the US economy was reliant on migrant labour and plans to build a wall on the border had caused ""anger and outrage"".""I think the treatment of Mexico by the US, just as much as the absurd, abusive language to Muslims, is something that should be challenged and has to be challenged,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show."

Those surveyed said they would welcome further support.The BCC carried out the survey in conjunction with Middlesex University researchers.One third of those questioned said the availability of childcare was a ""key issue in recruiting and retaining staff"".Some 12% said their employees' productivity had fallen because of the cost of childcare, and a further 8% said staff changed roles within their business as a result of the same issue.Although almost 40% of the businesses surveyed said the government plans to double free childcare in 2017 would help, the BCC said it was calling on ministers to do more, including considering offering universal childcare until a child started school.Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, said the government should consider the childcare system as part of Britain's core business infrastructure - ""in the same way that it thinks of energy, transport, or broadband"".A Department for Education spokesman said that in England, from September, parents would have up to 30 hours of childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds, ""helping to remove the barriers that can stop them from working"".""It is backed up by a record £6bn per year investment in childcare by the end of the Parliament, as well as introducing tax-free childcare worth up to £2,000 per child per year.""

Will Trump-style revolt engulf Europe?Trump's rude awakening for GermanyBerlusconi says Trump is like himUK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said both Mr Trump and Ms Le Pen use ""awful and absurd language"" against Muslims and other minorities.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""She uses this populism against minorities in order to get herself elected.""Speaking to the Marr Show in a pre-recorded interview, Ms Le Pen was asked if victory now looked likelier for her.""Yes, I wish that in France also the people upend the table, the table around which the elite are dividing up what should go to the French people,"" she said.French voters would, she said, be offered the choice of a multicultural society ""following the model of the English-speaking world, where fundamental Islam is progressing"" and ""an independent nation, with people able to control their own destiny"".""I believe that every country has the right to defend its own interests,"" she added.She also called the EU an ""oppressive model"", and said it would be replaced by a ""Europe of free nations"" which ""many Europeans are yearning for"".Asked about the potential threat posed by Russia since its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and military intervention in Syria last year, she said there was ""no reason to be scared"".""Russia is a European country, and so we'd better, if we want a powerful Europe, negotiate with Russia,"" she added.She also praised that country's ""reasoned protectionism"" under President Vladimir Putin, who she says is ""looking after the interests of his own country, defending its identity"".Russia celebrates Trump winMarine Le Pen profileNational Front's changing faceIs this the end for liberal democracy?Asked about immigration, Ms Le Pen said: ""We are not going to welcome any more people, stop, we are full up!""On relations with French Muslims, she said she did ""not judge people based on their religion"" but the state would ""act accordingly"" if people refused to ""comply with our codes, our values, our French lifestyles"".France is home to the largest Muslim community in Western Europe. Jihadist attacks over the past two years have contributed to a rise in anti-immigration sentiment.The FN leader denied her party was motivated by racism, saying: ""I don't think it's racist to say that we cannot take in all the poverty of the world, we cannot take care of hundreds of thousands of people arriving here, because our first obligation is to protect the French people.""But Mr Corbyn said Le Pen uses a ""shallow, populist, nasty"" appeal.He added: ""The reality is she does not have an economic answer to the problems faced by left communities in France, any more than UKIP has an answer to the left behind communities in Britain"". A spokesman for UKIP said the party had made it clear for many years that it does not share the same policies of the FN, whose immigration policy is driven by its ""long standing antipathy to significant groups"".""We believe that immigration is a boon to this country, but that it should be controlled, with no hint of favour for any group or ethnicity,"" the spokesman added.UK viewers can see the full interview on BBC One's Andrew Marr show at 09:00 GMT on Sunday, and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer"

Conservative MP Stephen Phillips resigned last week, citing ""irreconcilable policy differences"" with the government.The barrister and part-time judge had complained that the government was ""lurching to the right"" and had criticised its attempt to trigger Article 50, beginning the formal process for the UK to leave the EU, without a vote by MPs. The High Court has since ruled that the government must consult MPs - although ministers are appealing against the decision to the Supreme Court.Lincolnshire voters were among the most Eurosceptic in the UK, with more than 75% of voters in Boston voting to leave.This could benefit UKIP's Ms Ayling, who said she was ""honoured"" to be selected, and that as a local councillor she understands ""the issues facing Lincolnshire.""Conservative Dr Johnson said she was delighted to be selected, adding: ""I am the only person who can support the prime minister and the government to deliver Brexit. I am completely behind the government's plans for Brexit and to deliver on the decision made by the British people.""Mr Clarke, a trade unionist and former postman, said he was honoured to fight the seat for Labour and would stand up for locals in parliament.""It is not right that in 2016 working people here in Sleaford and North Hykeham are having to choose between heating and eating.""He accused the government of having ""no plan for Brexit"" and pledged to ""hold the government to account on ensuring the best deal for Britain, which protects our local jobs"".Local councillor Mark Suffield is standing as an independent while Peter Hill is standing for the Monster Raving Loony Party."

All opposition parties have voiced support for single market access at various points since the EU referendum.Holyrood's Europe committee has already called for single market access to be a key priority in the Brexit negotiations, although the UK government has refused to give a ""running commentary"" on its negotiating position.Mr Brown will seek to reinforce this position by uniting Holyrood's parties in Tuesday's debate.He said: ""I am asking the Scottish Parliament to show consensus on this issue, so we can unanimously call on the UK Government to explore all avenues to protect this access, rather than dragging Scotland out against our will.""He continued: ""The EU is a vital trading body for Scotland. Cutting ties with the EU single market would seriously threaten Scotland's attractiveness as a place to do business, remove several vital streams of funding, and endanger the security of jobs, businesses and services across the country.""That is why it is essential that this week our national Parliament sends as united a message as possible that Scotland must remain in the single market.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has previously pledged to argue for ""the greatest amount of access to the single market"" possible post-Brexit.Following a meeting at Downing Street in July, Ms Davidson said she had discussed the importance of the single market to Scottish business with Theresa May.She said: ""We have to look at the particular context of places like Northern Ireland, Scotland and London, which voted to stay in [the EU] in quite large numbers, to get the best deal for all parts of the UK.""For me personally that means having the greatest amount of access to the single market. That's what helps British business and Scottish business, so that's the argument I'm going to continue to make.""However, she has also stated that while the European market is ""very important"", ""it is not as important as our own UK single market"", pointing to the much larger volume of trade Scotland does with the rest of the UK compared with the EU.Scottish Labour have vocally backed Scotland's place in the single market, with Kezia Dugdale calling for ""all options"" to be explored to protect this, including a ""federalised UK"".The party drew up a ""post-Brexit action plan"" for Scotland's economy, which underlined the importance of the European market to the financial services sector in particular.The Scottish Greens called for the single market to be reformed in the build-up to the EU referendum, but were committed backers of the Remain campaign.Since, the party's Europe spokesman Ross Greer has called for ""every avenue"" to be explored ""to keep Scotland in Europe"", including the possibility of Scottish independence.The Scottish Lib Dems are strongly pro-European, with leader Willie Rennie calling on members at the party's autumn conference not to ""give up on Europe"".However, the party withdrew its support from Nicola Sturgeon's negotiating position with the UK after Mr Rennie said she was only interested in pursuing Scottish independence."

Mr Vaz, 59, said he welcomed the police's investigation.   The police said they would not confirm or comment on the identity of anyone involved. The Sunday Mirror story in September included photographs and secret recordings it said were of Mr Vaz with the sex workers in a north London flat he owns. Drugs, including cocaine, were mentioned during a secretly-recorded conversation.The recording also included a discussion about using the party drug known as poppers.Mr Vaz had opposed government attempts to criminalise the drug. Ministers later announced they would remain within the law. Following the initial allegations, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he would be writing to Scotland Yard calling for Mr Vaz to be investigated for misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to supply controlled substances.Scotland Yard said police had received a letter on 7 September asking them to look into the matter.The force said one of its specialist teams then began an assessment process to see ""what criminal offences - if any - may have been committed"".A spokesman said: ""Following that assessment, which included obtaining early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan Police Service is now investigating offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.""The investigation started on Thursday 10 November.""Keith Vaz - the 'Teflon politician'Mr Vaz, the Leicester East MP and a married father-of-two, resigned as chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee two days after the Sunday Mirror's report.In a statement he said: ""I welcome a full investigation as a means of establishing the true facts and I am confident the police will pursue all lines of enquiry. ""I will cooperate with the investigation in any way I can.""Last month Mr Vaz joined the Commons justice committee  after Mr Bridgen tried to block the appointment.The Conservative MP has since called for Mr Vaz to stand down from that committee until any police investigations have concluded.He also called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to suspend Mr Vaz from the party while the police investigate."

There is a regular Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Monday where a range of issues can be discussed in the normal way.  ""We do not see the need for an additional meeting on Sunday because the US election timetable is long established. An act of democracy has taken place, there is a transition period and we will work with the current and future administrations to ensure the best outcomes for Britain.""What will Trump's foreign policy look like?Five ways the world could changeThe hotel developer who became presidentOn Friday Mr Johnson said: ""With respect to my beloved EU friends and colleagues, I think it is time we snapped out of the general doom and gloom about the result of this election and the collective whinge-o-rama that seems to be going on in some places"".Mr Johnson's remarks are in stark contrast to those of EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.He said Mr Trump's election risked upsetting EU ties with the US ""fundamentally and structurally"".He said: ""We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works"", adding that two years would be wasted while Mr Trump ""tours a world he doesn't know"".Meanwhile, UKIP interim leader Nigel Farage reportedly met Mr Trump's team when he visited New York's Trump Tower on Saturday, warning there were some ""some fences to be mended"" between Britain and the president-elect.He told Fox News Mr Trump would have to deal with Prime Minister Theresa May, despite her top team being ""rude"" about him.""Trump is an Anglophile, he understands and recognises what our two great nations have done together between us. And, thank goodness, we are coming towards the end of an American president who loathed Britain,"" he said.""One of the things we can do, we can have between us a sensible trade relationship, cut tariffs, we are massive investors in each other's countries. There's a bright future.""Tom Brake, Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, accused Mr Johnson of being an ""artless diplomat"" whose decision to snub the meeting would further damage the UK's relationship with other EU leaders.He said Mr Trump's election raised ""a huge number of questions"" for Britain, Europe and the rest of the world, including concerns over potential US protectionism, Nato, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syria.""We face a difficult period for UK foreign relations and having this artless diplomat in charge of proceedings puts us on the back foot,"" he added.Following his victory Mr Trump spoke with Mrs May. A Downing Street spokesman said they agreed that ""the US-UK relationship was very important and very special and that building on this would be a priority for them both"".But a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrat coalition partner, Axel Schafer, said the PM's hope that Mr Trump will look favourably on the UK would come to nothing.Mr Schafer told The Times: ""What changed is the likelihood of a speedy and preferential trade deal between the UK and US. Even before Tuesday the chances were rather low, now the hope for this kind of deal seems delusional."""

He accused the Tories of being like Mr Trump by offering ""slogans, but not solutions for most people in Britain"".The Conservatives said Labour was ""out of step"" with ""ordinary people"". In a speech to the Labour South East Regional Conference, Mr Corbyn described Mr Trump's shock election victory over Hillary Clinton as a ""global wake-up call"".Mr Corbyn said millions of people in the US and UK feel ""left behind"" and ""marginalised"" by the current economic system - something Mr Trump had tapped into during the election campaign.""There is deep anger at a political elite that doesn't listen,"" he said.""But instead of offering real solutions or the resources to make them work, he offered only someone to blame - everyone that is apart for those actually responsible for the broken economy or the failed political system. ""That's Trump in his election campaign in the USA. Now cross that Atlantic to here. The Tories do exactly the same.""The Labour leader said the US and UK electorates both felt left behind by an economic system that made them work harder while rewarding a small elite.He told supporters the UK will be unable to ""take back control"" by simply leaving the EU and instead needed to ""take on corporate vested interests"".The Conservatives have ""opened the door to UKIP and fanned the flames of fear"", he added. ""Theresa May as home secretary fed the idea that immigration was the real problem, made promises she knew she couldn't deliver about slashing numbers,"" he said. ""And she whipped up hate with those notorious go home vans. No wonder she didn't even temper her welcome to Donald Trump.""She has used the same strategy herself - if delivered with a more refined voice.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""Jeremy Corbyn presides over a Labour Party that is divided, divisive and utterly out of step with the concerns of ordinary working people.""Labour would bankrupt our country like they did last time, erode our armed forces, making us less safe - and they also don't think there should be any limits on immigration at all."""

She told the BBC she wanted to ""flush out"" companies abusing existing rules and ""nudge them into better behaviour"".Briefing notes from her department also suggested they could be required to ""be clear about the proportion of their workforce which is international"", a practice which the Home Office said was standard in the US.Defence Secretary Michael Fallon later clarified that, if the plan went ahead, it would mean firms providing numbers overall rather than individual names.But, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Analysis, Mr Prouza, the Czech Republic's state secretary for European affairs, said: ""I think the performance at the Conservative Party conference was again stoking the fires. ""When you had all these ideas of British companies that would have to report the number of foreigners they employ, maybe even the names of the foreigners they employ, that is very similar to what we have seen on the continent in the 1930s.""I think we all remember what it led to. So I think we see it as very dangerous and I was really hoping that Prime Minister May would condemn these ideas very quickly and it's not happened. So that is a worry.""A UK government spokesman said: ""There is no plan to list foreign workers and never has been. The proportion of international workers in a company is one of the pieces of information that companies may be asked to provide to the government. This information will not be published. ""This already happens in the US and is one of several proposals we will be consulting on as part of our work to ensure that companies take reasonable steps to recruit at home before looking to bring in workers from abroad. ""The purpose of having a consultation is so that we can listen to business and use that feedback to inform our decisions"".Racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales increased by 41% in the month after June's EU referendum, according to Home Office figures.It said the sharp increase had declined in August but had ""remained at a higher level than prior to the EU referendum"".Mr Prouza said: ""At the moment we need to support the security of Czechs. We've seen an enormous increase in attacks on Czechs and other foreigners on British soil.""We've had dozens and dozens of people complaining to the Czech embassy in London, sharing their negative experiences in places where they have lived for five or 10 years and never had a problem.""In the last six months there is more and more of these issues."" Mr Prouza said that, in a recent conversation with Mrs May, Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka had told her: ""We would really like to see the British government doing something about these xenophobic, nationalistic attacks.""Ms Rudd has said: ""We should be able to have a conversation about the skills we need.""I don't think we should have a situation where we can't talk about immigration. ""We must not ignore the fact that people want to talk about immigration and if we do talk about immigration, don't call me a racist.""

2016-11-13,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "

2016-11-13,India unmoved,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37950198,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe prime minister seemed pleased with the outcome of her trade visit to India. Theresa May said the 33-strong delegation had sealed deals worth £1bn, laying the groundwork for more than 1,300 jobs in the UK.Mrs May even donned a sari on a visit to a Hindu temple in the southern city of Bangalore, mixing the traditional with the modern. Bangalore has now become an important IT base for many other countries.Yet in India, they're not so sure. Her reception was polite, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi granting her an unusually long meeting of 90 minutes, but there are now significant tensions in the relationship which three days of photo opportunities will not resolve.Lord Bilimoria, the Indian-born businessman who created Cobra beer, has been on many of these trade trips stretching back 20 years, with both Conservative and Labour prime ministers.On The World This Weekend on Radio 4, he told me that Indian companies had invested more in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. They've seen it as the bridge to the EU. As a result of Brexit, that bridge is about to be broken, so having good links with the UK will become less important.That means India could, in future, see Britain as a less essential trade partner, just as the UK needs its enormous market even more.The problem is exacerbated by British decisions about immigration. The treatment of Indians who have studied in the UK and want to remain, and those who come as tourists or to work, rankles the Indian government. It's Mrs May herself who's blamed. At the Home Office, she presided over an increasingly restrictive policy, in contrast with the Cameron government's treatment of wealthy Chinese, who have seen many obstacles to their entry removed.Leaving Europe could improve the situation. As home secretary, Mrs May cut back on non-EU migration, to try to meet the challenging target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands of people. She's powerless to cut the numbers of citizens from other EU countries coming to the UK. Post-Brexit, she could spread the reduction more evenly.As president of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, Lord Bilimoria told me that a particular source of tension is over the treatment of students. ""The reality is Theresa May - when she was home secretary - did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration,"" he told me. ""We continue to include international students within our net migration figures,"" he added. ""The perception that sends out to the rest of the world, including India, is Britain wants to reduce the number of international students.""In that, the policy has been successful, with numbers falling from 40,000 to 20,000 in the last five years. Successful in British terms, perhaps, but Lord Bilmoria says, not to Indians. ""Theresa May as home secretary is the one who said that: 'I want international students to leave the day they graduate.' And the headlines in India at that time were: 'Take our money and then get out.'""In our interview, Lord Bilimoria revealed to me that last year David Cameron, then the prime minister, had suggested policy was about to change. ""David Cameron… told me personally in November: 'Karan, I think we should take international students out of the net migration figures.' It didn't happen.""  Whether he changed his mind, or lost a battle within Cabinet, the Indian government was very disappointed that no such announcement ever came.Nor did it this time. Theresa May did propose speeding up the application process for India's businesspeople, but said other changes would only be considered if the deportation of Indians who had overstayed their welcome in the UK could be speeded up.As for students, she said they were welcome, and pointed out that nine out of 10 student applicants did receive a visa. That may be true, but are there as many applications as there were in the past?Currency questions have been distracting Indians in the days since her visit, after the dramatic decision to cancel the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. So the average man or woman in India may not yet have fully absorbed Mrs May's visa resistance.There are reasons, then, to doubt how quickly India will want to reach a trade deal when Brexit happens. Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was optimistic that Britain's partners in the world outside the EU would jump at the chance, observing: ""We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen, and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny civil service. ""Are we really unable to do trade deals?""I quoted that to the Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suggesting that India would therefore be better disposed towards Britain than to some other countries. ""Well, I thought so and most of us in India thought so; but we aren't being treated as old friends any longer. It's a tight professional engagement,"" she said.In such relationships, calls to old loyalties or sentiment don't count for very much.You can hear The World This Weekend on Sunday lunchtimes at 13:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4, and via the BBC iPlayer."
2016-11-13,New era,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/37949669,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkRemember when politics was rather dull? When across the West the electoral pendulum swung reliably between parties of the centre left and centre right? There was consensus about the benefits of a global market economy. Politicians seemed to talk the same way, wear the same ties, parrot the same stale slogans. Meanwhile voters got on with shopping, and turning out at elections in ever decreasing numbers. This seemed to be the condition of liberal democracy at the start of 2016. But the seedbed for Brexit and Trump was there. As politics became the preserve of a professional office-seeking class the old parties shrank. Popular indifference and distrust of politics grew. A few years ago the political scientist Peter Mair argued that Western democracy was being hollowed out. With one referendum and a presidential election, liberal democracy as we've known it seems finally, dramatically, to have collapsed in on itself. Too hyperbolic? In response to Donald Trump's victory, the authoritarian, anti-immigration Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, said it was ""great news"" and claimed his victory marked the end of a period of ""liberal non-democracy"". This is the same Viktor Orban who was greeted with a mock-Nazi salute by the president of the European Commission at a summit last year. ""The dictator is coming,"" quipped Jean-Claude Juncker. Now many Western leaders are sweating. Last month the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the West's political values were in danger of breaking down. What does he think those values are? ""Human rights, civil liberties, including the freedom of speech and religion, free market and a competitive economy based on private property, reasonable and fair redistribution of goods, restrictions on power resulting from rules and tradition, tolerance and political pluralism."" Mr Tusk said those who questioned liberal democracy were happy about Brexit, looked up to President Putin and supported Donald Trump. And it's true that from the coffee shops of Brooklyn to the bistros of Brussels there is a sense of melancholy and foreboding. For people who have enjoyed the political stability and economic opportunities delivered by decades of liberal democracy these are bewildering, unsettling times. ""How"", they ask, ""can Britain possibly have voted to leave the EU?"" Millions of despairing Americans are grappling with the prospect of President Donald Trump. ""Is Le Pen next?"" they fret in the cafes of Paris. But for voters who cast ballots for Brexit and Donald Trump it feels like politics has finally listened to them. The ""left behind"" economic narrative does not account for the full variety of forces behind this new populism. But in the view of Parag Khanna, an American professor in Singapore and author of the new book Connectography, 2016 will be remembered as the year that ""the global underclass revolt crystallised in the form of the Brexit and the Trump election"".""This uncoordinated movement really began with Occupy Wall Street and has now claimed its biggest scalp,"" he says.Prof Vernon Bogdanor, at King's College London, agrees. ""There is a division between the exam-passing classes who are not hostile to the global elite and the left behind who are nationalist and protectionist,"" he says.""It takes different forms in different countries but it's now a fairly common phenomenon in Europe and America.""Prof Bogdanor tells me the new political cleavage is not between left and right but between nationalist populism and those perceived as ""elites"". And he is worried.""The election of Donald Trump is the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It's not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s. We're seeing a pale imitation of what we saw then"", he says, while careful to make clear he doesn't consider the president-elect a fascist. But Claire Fox, the director of the Institute of Ideas, thinks the vitality of liberal democracy has been proved by the Brexit and Trump results. ""We have to be careful of an anti-democratic response to perfectly legitimate democratic votes. Quite a lot of liberals are saying, 'well, democracy is not working so well because people are voting in a way we don't want them to vote', which strikes me as a supreme irony."" A suffocating political and cultural consensus has driven the backlash we are seeing now, she believes. ""There has been arguably far less tolerance over the last 10 years for anyone who doesn't agree with what a particular elite outlook is - and a silence or demonising of people who don't go along with the narrative."" Ms Fox cites public concern about immigration as a prime example and she also takes exception to the suggestion liberal democracy is being threatened by an ugly authoritarianism. ""The whole of the establishment, from army generals to big business, lined up to say Brexit was a mistake,"" she argues. ""What's authoritarian is employers turning round to their workers and saying jobs would be lost. ""We had an elite who thought they could call a referendum, mobilise everybody who should go and vote as they were told. That's caused a massive tantrum amongst the elite who then have the nerve to say it's the people's fault for threatening democracy.""Whether or not this political upheaval should be celebrated or feared, it feels like a rupture with the past. We are rumbling over an important set of points with little idea where we are heading. Brexit and Trump promised political control to people who felt their lives had little of it, who were furious at the gulf between their political rulers and the governed and mourned the social cohesion of the past, and whose voices were not heard much in the media. In the raucous, angry echo chamber of social media a fight back brewed. The flipside seems to be growing intolerance of pluralism and difference. That is why people like Donald Tusk anxiously wonder how Western liberal democracy can respond and survive. Because there is nothing inevitable about its continuity. As author and political philosopher John Gray wrote recently, plenty of authoritarian regimes in the world are doing well. The middle class in Russia appears wedded to a combination of consumerism and nationalism and in China many want nothing more than rising living standards and freedom in their private lives. ""Liberal societies cannot depend on history for their survival,"" he says in a New Statesman article. ""They need to defend themselves."" At the moment however, the winners from globalisation and the political elites have lost and the dissenters have won. "
2016-11-13,Voter revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUS voters have delivered a blow to the political establishment by electing outsider Donald Trump to the presidency, much like UK voters did earlier this year when they opted to leave the EU. But just how close are the parallels between Tuesday's result and June's referendum? Were the voters who gave Mr Trump his victory much the same as those who voted to leave the EU? For many on this side of the Atlantic, there was a strong sense of deja vu on Tuesday night as it gradually emerged that Donald Trump has pulled off a dramatic victory. It all seemed reminiscent of the drama that British voters had experienced when in the small hours of 24 June it became apparent that a majority had voted to leave the European Union.One reason of course was that neither result had been expected. In the UK most - though not all - polls put Remain narrowly ahead. In the US most - though again not quite all - polls put Hillary Clinton narrowly in the lead. Read carefully, neither set of polls could in fact be said to point to a clear winner, but most commentators had convinced themselves that Remain and Mrs Clinton respectively would emerge victorious.But another arguably more important reason for the sense of deja vu was the similarity between some of Donald Trump's key campaign messages and those of the Leave campaign. Both majored on concerns about immigration. Both questioned whether the existing global financial order necessarily benefitted the ordinary man in the street. And both portrayed themselves as the underdogs campaigning against an allegedly complacent and out of touch political establishment.In the UK these stances have been shown to appeal in particular to the so-called ""left behind"", that is, voters who feel they have lost out economically in recent years and who are uncomfortable with some of the social changes that have been going on around them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was remarkably successful in such mid-West Rust Belt states as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, where the decline of manufacturing industry has seemingly created a part of America that can also be said to have been ""left behind"". There are certainly some striking similarities between the UK and US voting trends. To begin with, older voters in the UK were inclined to vote to leave the EU, whereas a majority of younger voters were in favour of remaining, according to exit poll data. Similarly, in the US Mrs Clinton was ahead among younger voters, while Mr Trump was more likely to be preferred by older citizens.At the same time, an educational divide was apparent in both ballots. In the UK, polls suggested a majority of university graduates were keen on remaining in the EU, while those without a degree voted to leave. Equally, in the US, exit polls indicate college graduates were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton, whereas those who were not college graduates inclined towards Donald Trump.Moreover, this educational divide was one of the most remarkable features of the US election. Republican candidates do not usually do better among non-graduates than graduates. In 2012 the level of support for the then-Republican standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, was almost exactly the same in the two groups. Here perhaps is the strongest evidence that Mr Trump's campaign messages had a particular resonance for a certain section of the US population that might also be described as ""left behind"".However, perhaps the analogy should not be pushed too far. A closer look at graphic above reveals that the education divide in the EU referendum was rather sharper than that in the US election.In the UK the gap was wide - around three-fifths of graduates voted to remain, while 63% of non-graduates cast a vote for leaving. In the US it was more nuanced - only just over half of college graduates voted for Mrs Clinton and only just over half of non-graduates backed Mr Trump.Moreover, in other respects the claim that it was the ""left behind"" who took Mr Trump to victory does not match the evidence.  In the UK those who voted to leave often had few, if any, educational qualifications, but also tended to be on lower incomes. Around two-thirds of those with incomes of less than £20,000 ($25,000) a year voted to leave, while around three in five of those earning more than £40,000 ($50,000) backed staying in the EU.But Mr Trump was not particularly successful among low-income voters. In fact, just over half of those with incomes of less than $30,000 (£24,000) voted for Mrs Clinton. Conversely, those on more than $100,000 (£80,000) a year only preferred Mr Trump by the narrowest margins. Mr Trump's campaign messages may have enabled him to reach out to voters with few, if any, qualifications for whom social issues such as immigration are often a particular concern. However, it appears he was less successful at mobilising support among those who might be thought to be economically left behind.There are other parallels between the vote in the US and that in the UK too, though in the case of the US at least they reflect political differences that long predate Mr Trump. The Republican president-elect was well ahead among white voters, but trailed Mrs Clinton heavily amongst the remainder of America's increasingly diverse population. In the UK too, black and minority ethnic voters were disinclined to vote to leave, put off perhaps by the Leave campaign's focus on the issue of immigration.Meanwhile, evangelical Protestants once again turned out for the Republican nominee in very strong numbers, while those who do not profess any religion at all voted heavily for Mrs Clinton.In the UK, too, those who do not claim to belong to any religion - a much larger group than in the US - were inclined to vote to remain. However, the religious divide in the UK largely reflects the fact that younger voters are more likely not to claim some kind of religious identity, rather than having much to do with their religious outlook itself.US elections have also long been marked by a gender difference, with women being more likely to vote Democrat, men to support the Republicans. That, too, was also in evidence on Thursday. That was one divide that was not evident at all in the UK referendum - men and women voted in much the same way. It seems that Mr Trump still has much to learn from UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, now UK foreign secretary, when it comes to wooing women voters.

2016-11-13,Election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."
2016-11-13,Two of a kind?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161114021853/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922961,"""It'll be Brexit plus plus plus!"" said Donald Trump. It was. If Brexit felt like a political earthquake, the election of this populist president was off the seismic scale, the continental plates shifting underneath the country which has defined our modern world.Obama had that poster - ""Hope"" in cool colours. Trump paints in brasher, bolder strokes. His triumph is a release of pent-up anger but it is still about that same yearning for a change. Make no mistake. This victory, like Brexit, gives a new hope for a better future to those who backed it - and their aspirations and expectations will be sky high. Both left the political establishment, not to mention the pollsters, reeling in shock. I am glad on this occasion I had been telling everyone who'd listen, that after last June's Brexit shock and the UK General Election's surprise I just didn't trust the polls. After all if people were ""shy"" of admitting they backed David Cameron how much more bashful would they feel in declaring for Trump? My gut feeling was that he would win. In my five years in the US I'd seen the frustration and fury mounting.It is perhaps ironic that our two countries, with a reputation for stable political systems, have delivered political revolutions of such importance. Or perhaps it's not. Perhaps their stability and strength is they can cope with popular revolts, without pitchforks or getting blood all over our sans culottes.  The wave of populism all over the West has already delivered a very right-wing government in Hungary, and a very left-wing one in Greece. For years there has been a mounting mood, a disconnect between politicians and people which finds expression in a search for politics outside the old norms. Those of us who've been urging people to pay attention to these movements shouldn't now gloat about our foresight but ask hard questions about the political response, from left, right and centre.There's no doubt the election of the 45th president and Brexit have similar roots. But word of caution for both sides of the Atlantic - voters are individuals, and this is a mood, not a party programme. As Trump put it, not a campaign but ""a great movement"". People who voted for either revolution may share some of the concerns outlined below, but not others. Indeed, if there was a simple root cause it wouldn't be so powerful.Be cautious about the theory this is all about the ""left behinds"" - older, poorly-educated white workers disposed by globalisation, the children and grandchildren of the rust belt. It is not wrong, but it is not sufficient. Those whose jobs have gone to Mexico and China, those who did well-paid jobs undercut by immigration, are indeed of a mood against neoliberalism and globalisation. But that is a simple story about the economy that doesn't quite do justice to the complexity of the last 30 years.  In today's economy many more than just the disposed working class feel left out. The gap between the very rich and the rest widens, bills and insecurity pile up, but neither their prospects nor the economy grows apace. It isn't getting any better.Few politicians dare tell them that increased automation may take more jobs than immigrants. You can't deport a driverless truck. Nevertheless, the fears of the economic and cultural effects of immigration looms very large.Behind it lurk worries about an insecurity about identity. While some feel at home in Beijing, Berlin or Birmingham, others no longer feel at home in their home. I'll be interested to see if the detailed breakdown proves me wrong but, let's face it, it doesn't seem to be economically insecure black or Hispanic voters who backed The Donald.If the UK has very similar concerns there is an added component in the US. Either because of its history of civil war and slavery, there's little doubt race is a critical factor - some whites feel that America is no longer their property - because it isn't. Another difference. In the US the evangelical Christian right, very concerned about abortion and changing sexual morality, is a force we don't have in the UK. But in both countries distaste for the liberal elite goes hand in hand with a despair at a government that is seemingly unresponsive and out of touch. This is very much stronger in the States than here, when Washington is almost a swear word, where a gridlocked Congress has frozen most attempts to get things done.  The American system was designed to be slow, and block change unless it is consensual (itself arguably a legacy of slavery). But that system feels broken, dysfunctional, almost beyond repair. And here's my own hobby horse - while American elections are ideal reality TV, the nuts and bolts of democratic politics can seem almost quaint in an internet age of huge choice.When we can change our mortgage or our energy company at the click of a mouse, voting for one of two bundles of policies every four or five years seems curiously sluggish. I wrote last week that if Donald Trump was seen as a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, it was worth remembering that people bought that patent medicine because every other remedy had failed.As one European central banker said recently, people sway the bridge because it no longer seems a way of crossing the river. The volume of articles peering behind the populism will grow. But we need people who change the world, rather than describe it.  We need to hear coherently and urgently from those on every side of the debate. Those who support globalisation and immigration need to step up to the plate and be more specific about the benefits of their project. Those, like Theresa May, who seem to accept part of the populist message must be urged to spell out how they square the circle of a linked world economy of free trade with answering concerns about industrial policy and identity. And, of course, those who caustically and brilliantly articulate the concerns need to develop solutions.The president-elect has a few months to work out how to turn a howl of anguish into effective policy. No doubt along with a few good soundbites. From anguish to hope to relief is a long journey.Some members of the US establishment argue that Donald Trump can be contained or that, having achieved his aim, the brutal rhetoric will be ditched, he won't really build a wall, ban Muslims, deport millions of illegal immigrants or make the Middle Eastern desert glow. That may be so. He will be a hero for a good while and the outrage of liberals, combined with his brutalist charisma, will be a bulwark against criticism from his own side, for a while. But he must be aware the hard right cherish myths of betrayal and  it will, after a while, swoop like a hawk on any backsliding.  There is a deeper danger. At the heart of his presidency will be how he deals with immigration and the economy. Anyone who has travelled America's roads and rails and used its airports will understand Trump's call for massive investment in infrastructure. Such a Keynesian stimulus would provide ""shovel ready"" jobs for the dispossessed. But it is hard to see where the cash would come from, if he is curbing Americans' overspending, and drastically cutting taxation. Similarly, there could be strains in the Trump coalition between those who want a radically smaller government and one that sticks its oar into big companies and banks. The biggest questions will be about his character and control. But his supporters may relish the occasional outburst. But the real lesson of this election is the breadth and depth of his ambition. Remember, in reality Obama was very cautious and promised very little. Trump has promised the moon by comparison. If he delivers it he will be a transformative figure who we have all underestimated. If he fails, there will still be millions of angry, disillusioned Americans still searching for hope."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Labour said Mrs May had ""no plan"" for life in a post-Brexit world.Speaking at London's Guildhall, Mrs May told the audience of leading business figures she envisaged a stronger role for government in developing an industrial strategy aimed at spreading wealth more evenly across the country.She said that, after Mr Trump's victory in the US presidential election, ""change is in the air"", adding: ""To be the true global champion of free trade in this new modern world, we also need to do something to help those families and communities who can actually lose out from it.""Not standing inflexibly, refusing to change and still fighting the battles of the past, but adapting to the moment, evolving our thinking and seizing the opportunities ahead.""That is the kind of leadership we need today. And I believe that it is Britain's historic global opportunity to provide it.""Mrs May said leaving the EU showed ""how a free, flexible, ambitious country can step up to a new global role"".""This is a new direction - a new approach to managing the forces of globalisation so that they work for all - and it is the course on which the government I lead has embarked,"" she said.Mrs May cited the UK's recent agreement to keep Nissan car production in the north-east of England and the development of a global hub to repair and maintain fighter aircraft in Wales as evidence of a competitive industrial strategy.Mrs May, who has called for more employee representatives on company boards and greater disclosure about corporate pay, also pledged to crack down on unfair business practices which ""undermine faith in capitalism and free markets"".The Guildhall speech is one of the major foreign policy and security addresses which the prime minister makes every year.Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI business group, said: ""It's encouraging to see the government make a robust case for free trade. Working with business, it can ensure that the benefits help drive productivity, and increase living standards in all parts of the country.""But, for Labour, shadow lord president of the council Jon Trickett said: ""Theresa May ‎has spent the early days of her time in Number 10 giving speeches about spreading opportunity and providing leadership but her actions have betrayed her.""She talks about leading Europe. But has no plan for Brexit. She talks about extending opportunity. But Britain's working people are worse off. And she talks about transforming the economy. But all that is on offer is more cuts, poor investment and little, if any, growth.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""Theresa May is trying to have her cake and eat it.  She talks about being pro-business but won't offer the one thing business leaders needs most: clarity on her plans for Britain's future with Europe. She can't have it both ways.""Meanwhile, Nigel Farage's meeting with US president-elect Mr Trump over the weekend meant he was the first British politician to meet Mr Trump since his election.Some Conservatives are questioning Mrs May's refusal to entertain any role for the interim UKIP leader in building links with the US administration, but a Downing Street source played down any disquiet.The source said any involvement for Mr Farage was ""categorically not going to happen"", adding: ""Farage is doing a very good PR job of trying to make himself seem indispensible.""Asked whether he would hire Mr Farage to improve links with Mr Trump, former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV's The Agenda: ""Absolutely not. I mean, Theresa May is a very sensible person who is not going to do that.""The British prime minister or the British government cannot contract its foreign policy out to Nigel Farage.""Mrs May's spokeswoman told reporters the relationship between Mr Trump and the PM was ""working well"" following an initial phone call that was ""very warm in tone"".Arriving in Brussels for a meeting with his EU counterparts, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson there was ""a lot to be positive about"" following Mr Trump's election.""It is very important not to pre-judge the president-elect or his administration,"" he added."

And we need a serious commitment from government to invest across the whole of our country.""Tom Bateman, BBC political correspondentSince the EU referendum, the Treasury has steered away from the tougher deficit reduction rules imposed by former Chancellor George Osborne. It has chosen instead to speak of a ""pragmatic"" approach to balancing the books, given what Philip Hammond described as the ""turbulence"" that Brexit may bring. But his Labour opponent will today condemn this approach as weak, arguing the government must go further and end austerity rather than postpone it. Mr McDonnell is also likely to call for a focus on borrowing to create jobs and infrastructure - a policy he has previously said would go alongside a rule to balance day-to-day taxation and spending. Labour knows its task is to present itself to voters as credible on the economy, as the battle lines are set out before the first major economic announcement of Theresa May's government next week. Mr McDonnell will accuse Mr Hammond of lacking influence over the process of withdrawing from the EU, saying: ""The CEO of Nissan probably knows more about our Brexit negotiating position than the chancellor.""""Britain cannot afford a weak chancellor who cannot find his voice, when our country faces the biggest economic challenges for a generation. It's time he steps up to the task and stands up to his cabinet colleagues.""However, Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour had ""zero credibility when it comes to the economy"".""They drove Britain to the brink of bankruptcy last time, opposed everything we did to clear up the mess - and now all they offer is a recipe for economic ruin.""Ordinary working people would pay the price for Jeremy Corbyn's fantasy economics.""It comes as the Institute of Directors (IoD) called on Mr Hammond to ""act decisively"" and use the Autumn Statement to introduce tax breaks to boost investment.It released survey figures indicating business confidence had declined in recent weeks, with 50% of the 1,071 respondents asked between 12 and 27 October saying they were pessimistic about the economy over the next 12 months.Some 30% said they were optimistic.IoD director general Simon Walker said: ""This is a moment for the government to act decisively to make it easier for firms to expand and find more opportunities.

He said the ex-prime minister had to hold the vote to overcome threats from UKIP and rebellious Conservative MPs.The 23 June vote went against Mr Cameron and he resigned the next day.His apparent calm afterwards showed his ""instinct was to be the leader"" and not that he was ""chillaxed about it"", Sir Craig told an audience in London.The promise of a referendum was part of the Conservatives' 2015 general election manifesto, meaning that when the party won a majority it was duty-bound to hold it.Sir Craig, who worked for Mr Cameron from 2011 until this year, said: ""If David Cameron had ignored the calls for a referendum, a great boulder would have been placed in the road of British politics.""He told the audience at the London School of Economics: ""A referendum in this country was inevitable.""The Remain campaign, which Mr Cameron backed, lost by 51.9% to 48.1%, leading critics to question why the referendum was promised in the first place.Asked if the former prime minister had been ""too relaxed"" following the vote, Sir Craig said: ""His natural instinct was to be the leader - in charge. That's not being chillaxed about it.""He was also critical of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's role in the the Remain campaign, saying he had not helped Mr Cameron ""get over the line"", as he had assumed the side would win and he did not want to help the Conservatives.Mr Cameron stood down as an MP in September."

The police probe, named Operation Conifer, began in 2015 after claims against Sir Edward surfaced.It also ""aims to safeguard children and vulnerable adults who may be at risk of abuse today"", the force said.The former Conservative prime minister died at home in Salisbury in July 2005, aged 89.The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation has said it is confident he would be cleared of any wrongdoing.Operation Conifer was set up after the Independent Police Complaints Commission began to probe alleged historical corruption.

It's not a punishment. It's an uncomfortable consequence for Britain.""Mr Danjean told Analysis: ""When it comes to border management, we will have to find a new agreement, definitely, because you can't make as if nothing has happened.""And we all know that the vote for Brexit was mainly expressed because of migration and immigration issues. So, it has an impact and we cannot continue like this.""I cannot imagine a French politician and a French president telling people, 'Well, you know, the Brits have decided to leave but we have to enforce the border at our border'. This would be very hard to explain.""""On this very important issue of border management, an effort should be made also on the British side.""Despite Mr Juppe's statements about moving border checks, Downing Street has said it expects the Le Touquet agreement to continue. Asked to respond to the comments from No 10, Mr Danjean said: ""I can understand the position, but I'm not sure it's a sustainable one.""The Le Touquet treaty allowed the UK and France to set up immigration controls in each other's Channel ports. It was worked out between the two countries, rather than being a European Union arrangement.Without the agreement, UK officials would have to wait until people and vehicles arrived in the country.But several senior French politicians say the build-up of thousands of refugees and migrants on the French side of the Channel has caused the country damage. Mr Juppe described it as ""disastrous "" for France's image, while having ""extremely serious economic and security consequences for the people of Calais"".But the UK government has said it is ""committed to working together to protect our shared border in Calais"" and to maintaining the current controls.Florian Philippot, head of strategy and communication for the anti-immigration National Front (FN) party, said the Le Touquet agreement had been ""poorly negotiated"", but criticised the idea of moving the UK's Channel borders.""The problem with that is that there will be many dead in the Channel,"" he said. ""That seems obvious because migrants will want to cross, will be able to cross, since the border will be moved to Dover."""

The European Parliament agreed in May to enhance the agency's mandate and improve the way it tackles cross-border crime and terrorism - but until now the UK was the only country not to have opted into the relevant agreement.Last month the National Crime Agency's David Armond warned said an ""immediate"", ""urgent"" decision was needed.The government said its decision to opt in was ""without prejudice"" to any negotiations over its future relationship with Europol when it leaves the EU.The Scottish government, which had been urging Home Secretary Amber Rudd to sign up, welcomed the announcement.But its cabinet secretary Michael Matheson added: ""While we welcome this decision, it only provides a temporary solution and protects our participation in Europol only while we remain part of the EU.""

Mrs Cox, 41, had supported the Remain side during the EU campaign, and was due to hold a constituency surgery in a library after visiting a local school and care home when she was attacked. Mr Mair told police officers ""I am a political activist"" when he was arrested less than a mile from the murder scene, the court heard. Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said: ""Thomas Mair clearly held views that provided him with a motive - utterly misplaced of course.""The prosecution suggests that motive was such that he killed her because she was an MP who did not share his views.""It was as Mrs Cox arrived for her constituency surgery that Mr Mair approached her from behind and stabbed her before shooting her, the court heard.Fazila Aswat, the MP's manager, allegedly heard the defendant shouting, ""This is for Britain. Britain will always come first,"" the prosecution told the jury.Items found at Mr Mair's home showed he had ""strong political and ideological interests"", Mr Whittam said.The court heard the accused had used computers to look up websites at the same library where Mrs Cox was due to hold her surgery.In May, he had accessed the Wikipedia page of an online publication called the Occidental Observer - a ""far-right"" publication ""that covers politics and society from a white nationalist and anti-Semitic perspective"", the prosecutor said.Jurors were told that in the days leading up to the killing that Mr Mair also looked at Twitter and Wikipedia pages for Mrs Cox and went on to view information on former Foreign Secretary William Hague.And he viewed websites on Nazi material, the death penalty in Japan, political prisoners and the human liver and spinal column.  On the eve of the attack, say prosecutors, Mr Mair researched right-wing politicians, as well as the Ku Klux Klan and civil rights activists killed by its supporters.The court heard Mr Mair was arrested following the attack and told officers he had a knife and gun in a black holdall he was carrying.Jurors were shown photographs of a German-made .22 Weihrauch bolt-action weapon and were told Mrs Cox's blood was found on the barrel during forensic examination.Mr Whittam told the court a knife found in Mr Mair's backpack also had blood on the handle which contained ""a major DNA profile matching that of Jo Cox and a minor DNA profile of the defendant"".Mrs Cox was shot three times, once in the chest and twice in the head, and stabbed 15 times including in the heart and lungs.She had wounds to her hands showing she raised them to try to defend herself, the court heard.Jo Cox was a self-proclaimed ""proud Yorkshire lass"" whose work for charity took her around the world and whose political success led her to Westminster.The 41-year-old mother-of-two was elected as MP for Batley and Spen in the 2015 election and increased Labour's majority to 6,051 (from 4,406 in the 2010 election).She described herself as ""proud and humbled"" to be the Labour MP for the place where she was born.Mrs Cox first worked in politics after graduating from Cambridge University in 1995, but then built a career working for charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the NSPCC.She was described by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as ""a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for justice and peace.""Tireless campaigner turned political 'star'Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the defendant making his way along the road after leaving his home on the morning of the killing.The court heard Mrs Cox arrived for her surgery with her manager Ms Aswat and senior caseworker Sandra Major at 12:50 BST.The prosecution claimed that Mr Mair attacked the Labour MP two minutes later in what it described as a ""dynamic, fast-moving and shocking incident"". Jurors were told that passer-by Shelly Morris reported hearing ""a loud bang like a popping sound"" and a ""loud piercing scream"".She said she saw a man with a large steak knife with a jagged blade which he wielded in a ""stabbing motion"".Jurors were told that 77-year-old Bernard Carter-Kenny was also injured as he tried to save Mrs Cox.Mr Mair denies murder, grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger.The trial continues, and is expected to last for up to three weeks."

Defence Veterans Minister Mark Lancaster told the Victoria Derbyshire programme government as a whole should be responsible for veteran care.He said the government would continue working in partnership with charities.Brenda Hale, whose husband was killed in Afghanistan, says there should ""absolutely"" be a dedicated department for care of veterans and families.Mr Lancaster said he believed the government had a duty of care towards service personnel after they left the armed forces.""But it is a partnership, we've always worked with charities, and I imagine that we always will,"" he said.""I don't want to go down the American model of having a dedicated veteran's department. ""I think it's right that government as a whole should be responsible for our veterans.""I may be the only minister with veterans in their title, but I don't want to be the only minister who is interested or committed to looking after our veterans.""Mrs Hale's husband, Mark, died in 2009, leaving behind her and their two daughters. It took her six months after his death to receive his pension payments after a dispute with government over his will, leaving her in serious financial trouble. She said if there were a minister in charge of a new department to care for veterans and their families, they would have to have wide-ranging powers.""That minister would need to have full responsibility across government departments to compel people to act,"" she said.""What we don't need is a tick box minister, where the [government] says, 'That box has been ticked and the veterans are being looked after.'""In 2010, the government announced that the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, set up in 2005, would be overhauled for troops injured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.This led to one-off awards for individual injuries being increased by more than 50% in some cases, while the rule of limiting compensation to the first three injuries suffered in a single incident was scrapped.Johnny Mercer, the Conservative MP for Plymouth, says that while he is not calling for a dedicated veterans department, he does think the care for ex-service personnel and their families must be improved, and that this effort should be led by the government.""What we need to do now is professionalise this industry, make sure the charities are good enough for what our people deserve, make sure somebody cares about these people, drag some through a care pathway, so that we deliver that duty we talk about all the time in the House of Commons,"" he said.""Until we ask these people what it's like going through that system, how it works for them, there's no point endlessly pouring money in, and announcements from government about X amount of billion pounds being made available. It means nothing unless it actually gets down to these people and changes their lives. Former Royal Marine Mark Ormrod had a triple amputation after stepping on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2007, and now has prosthetic limbs. He says he was told he could not receive funding to go to America to have them replaced.""The first time I needed replacement sockets I asked for the funding to go back to America and get what I needed, and they told me it wasn't available and that I'd have to go with what the NHS provided me,"" he said.""My injuries are not the cause of my stress. It's constantly battling to try and get the funding that I need for my prosthetics to overcome my injuries that causes me stress.""The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel."

The incoming US president has spoken to Theresa May by phone and there have been other contacts between ministers and representatives of the incoming administration.Mr Farage, who campaigned alongside Mr Trump during the election, suggested that many British politicians, including some close to Theresa May, had been ""quite rude"" about him during his ascent to power and now must re-think their attitudes.""I do think that just too many members of this government said too many nasty things about the President-elect, and I think there has to be a mending of fences,"" he said.There were huge opportunities to be had in ""Brexit Britain"", Mr Farage said, and Donald Trump would be a much more accommodating partner than his predecessor Barack Obama - who he suggested had ""damaged"" the relationship between both countries. Mr Farage told the BBC that there were some cabinet ministers who were open to the idea of his acting as a go-between with the president-elect, but said that Downing Street was more concerned with ""saying I'm irrelevant"".He called on the government to work closely with Mr Trump, saying: ""There's a real opportunity here.""""Not only President-elect Trump, but his whole team is Anglophile. ""They like our country, they recognise what we've done together in the past, and they're coming into this with an incredibly positive view. We need to seize the day.""Mr Farage denied that he would seek to work within Mr Trump's administration, saying: ""I'm not an American citizen, I'm not going to be getting a job with his team any time soon.""It's the image that encapsulates politics in 2016. President-elect Trump, in an open necked shirt, smiles, giving the thumbs up gesture. He's standing, shoulder to shoulder, with Nigel Farage in front of a glitzy, golden backdrop inside Trump Tower in New York. Outsiders, who faced scorn and ridicule, they stand together now as winners. To be anti-establishment now is to be mainstream. The two men, catalysts for political convulsions on both sides of the Atlantic, discussed ""freedom and winning,"" UKIP sources said. Their meeting was an embarrassment for Downing Street and stellar political theatre - but perhaps only that. Nigel Farage knows Mr Trump, but wields no power. The challenge for the UK government now is to build bridges with a new American administration it didn't want, and didn't expect to win.Mr Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the US at the end of 2015 led to a debate in Parliament on whether he should be barred from the UK while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, said Mr Trump must be ""out of his mind"".Mr Trump's spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway said Saturday's meeting between the two men in Trump Tower had been ""very productive"" and that they had talked about ""freedom and winning and what all this means for the world"".Mr Farage, who said Mr Trump ""was relaxed, and full of good ideas"", had joked on the way to the encounter that he was ""just a tourist"".A UKIP spokesman had previously confirmed that Mr Farage asked Mr Trump to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House Oval Office. Mr Farage said he had been ""especially pleased"" by Mr Trump's ""very positive reaction"" to the idea.A UKIP source said the meeting, held on 12 November, had ""made the prime minister look very foolish"".Mrs May plans to visit Mr Trump in the first three months of next year after his inauguration.The prime minister has said she hopes the two will be able to work on areas of mutual interest to enhance the special relationship between the two countries although some have said the government has no links with the Trump camp and will have to ""start from scratch"".Crispin Blunt, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, described as ""completely implausible"" the idea that Mr Farage would have an ambassadorial role in a Trump administration, telling the BBC there was ""no need for Nigel"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he understood the appeal of Mr Trump's rhetoric to people angry at being ""left behind"" by globalisation but he said the president-elect needed to ""grow up"" when it came to his views on immigration.Mr Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, said the US economy was reliant on migrant labour and plans to build a wall on the border had caused ""anger and outrage"".""I think the treatment of Mexico by the US, just as much as the absurd, abusive language to Muslims, is something that should be challenged and has to be challenged,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show."

Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he would scrap his ability to block some laws made in Wales about water.He said the decision puts right a ""long outstanding injustice"" 50 years after the flooding of a Gwynedd village to create a reservoir to supply Liverpool.The Welsh Government said it had called for the devolution of these powers ""for some time"", so welcomed the move. In 1965, the village of Capel Celyn was flooded to create the Tryweryn reservoir to provide Liverpool with water, under a law passed in 1956.Mr Cairns told BBC Radio's Good Morning Wales programme the changes settled an injustice ""where Wales was failed"".""Every secretary of state up until now has ducked this tough issue whereby water within Wales and England is inter-related"" he said, saying intervention powers over water legislation were maintained ""from Ron Davies to Peter Hain"".Why does it matter that the UK government will no longer be able to block some Welsh laws on water?There is the symbolism.Today, planning laws might stop another Tryweryn but water remains a sensitive political issue.It is also significant that Whitehall - after bruising negotiations between the Wales Office and DEFRA - has agreed to give up its veto.Read more from David hereThe changes will be made as amendments to the Wales Bill, which is being debated in the House of Lords on Tuesday. The Welsh secretary's powers to intervene on water-related legislation will be replaced by a legal agreement between the Welsh and UK governments.The Wales Office said it was too early to say exactly when that would be, but said there would be no cost to the taxpayer and no change in how customers in England and Wales receive their water. Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Wigley said: ""Plaid has fought hard over many years to get a fair settlement for Wales regarding water and to ensure that never again can a Tryweryn-type issue arise.""I look forward to seeing exactly what the government has to say on Tuesday."" The changes will take effect once a formal agreement between the UK and Welsh governments has been signed. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We look forward to receiving further details on this as soon as possible.""The decision follows pressure from the Welsh Government and from opposition politicians who believe the Wales Bill leaves too much power at Westminster.

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-14,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115034542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-14,Feeling insecure,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115034542/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37972087,"Walk the normally staid, greying corridors of EU power in Brussels at the moment and you sense an unaccustomed buzz, a nervousness; there's a whiff of almost frenzied expectation.Change is in the air: exciting and emboldening for some, frightening for others.Imagine the EU in a bowling alley. Well, frankly, its pillars of stability have been falling like ninepins.Brexit, mass migrant arrivals, Russian activity in Ukraine, cross-border Islamist terror (with the Paris attacks anniversary at the weekend), and now the election of Donald Trump as US president, with all the implication that may have for European politics, trade, security and defence.The UK foreign secretary may dismiss it as a ""whinge-o-rama"" and Hungary's government may mutter about ""exaggerated panic"", but EU leaders - and their foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday - have a list of clear-cut concerns about President-elect Trump.More on what Trump means for Europe:Mr Trump's America-first attitude, his comments appearing to question Nato's founding all-for-one-and-one-for-all clause and his apparent admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin have Europeans worried about defence and security, about Syria, about the Iran nuclear deal and about Europe itself. The Russia-fearing Eastern and Baltic countries feel particularly exposed.Yes, Donald Trump's commitment to Nato worries them but they're also apprehensive about changes in political tone towards Russia - not just in the US but here in Europe too.Resurgent anti-establishment, populist parties across the continent - in France, Italy, Austria and beyond - applaud Mr Trump and have established links with Russia.Far-right French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen, well-known for relations with Moscow, said she had accepted an invitation to work with Mr Trump. In Italy, the leader of the nationalist Northern League party told a crowd waving Russian and American flags that he was Italy's Trump.Now Russia-friendly candidates have won elections in Bulgaria and Moldova. And a party close to Moscow is making a power play in Estonia.     EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini is clearly worried.Once again, EU talk of a European Defence Union looms large.It's hardly a new idea - big powers France, Germany, Italy and Spain pushed loudly for it following the UK's Brexit vote in June - but now there's a sense of increased urgency.This is not about building an EU army, insist advocates (though some Europeans are in favour), but rather about sharing defence capabilities and moving towards increased self-reliance in an insecure world.The EU already has its own rapid reaction forces. One argument is that it should deploy them more assertively and effectively.Until now, the UK - one of only two significant military powers in the EU - consistently blocked any moves towards a common EU defence body but it has voted to leave the bloc.Still, to have a European defence union, you need unity amongst EU countries and there's little evidence of that amongst the fractious bunch of 28.When big power Germany hastily convened an EU foreign ministers' dinner in Brussels on Sunday night to discuss Donald Trump's victory, key players Britain and notably France didn't bother showing up.Nato ex-Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen dismisses any talk of the EU going down the defence path alone as ""a paper tiger"".And as much as Ms Mogherini asserts that the EU should be able to defend itself ""with the full potential of a superpower"", the bloc will continue to rely on the US and on Nato in particular.Not that long ago in Europe, mainstream politicians were wondering out loud about whether Nato was an out-dated organisation - hugely important in the shadow of World War Two but less significant in the 21st Century. But increasingly in the face of its multitude of crises - masses of migrants and asylum-seekers braving the Mediterranean to reach Europe, European cities under attack from cross-border Islamist terror and Russia flexing its muscles in the East - the EU has become increasingly reliant on Nato once again.Political memory is short."
2016-11-14,David Harewood,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115034542/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37799305,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link Take two children born in the UK today - one black and one white. What are the chances of one of them becoming prime minister? The black child is 12 times less likely to make it, according to a BBC documentary presented by David Harewood. The actor, who starred in the TV drama Homeland, reflects on what he found and his own experience of being black and British.We don't like talking about race in the UK - it's a very sensitive subject. People get extremely defensive and run for the covers but I believe we have to talk about it. My parents came over from Barbados in the late 1950s and early 60s. My father was a lorry driver and my mum also worked. The area where I grew up in Birmingham was very diverse - I was aware of my race but not overly aware of it - and there seemed to be an understanding that we were all very much in the same boat.There weren't very many black people on TV then and most of my heroes were American or Caribbean. The West Indian cricket team were probably the most successful black people that I remember seeing. There was always a bit of a carnival in my house whenever they came over and beat England. That was our one chance to culturally celebrate some kind of black success. I was lucky to get into drama school and become a professional actor. No-one ever mentioned the colour of my skin. It's only when I came out of RADA - the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art - that I suddenly realised people started to refer to me as a black actor. Initially I found work very easily and then I just sort of fell off a cliff. There are lots of roles for young black men but very few roles for leading black men in the UK. No-one's writing those roles, no-one's commissioning those dramas as they are in America. I've spent the past five or six years in America where I can play leading, authoritative characters - such as the head of the CIA in Homeland. I've got used to turning on my TV and seeing black generals, sheriffs, chiefs of police, politicians, financial experts, political experts and news anchors. I'm used to seeing black people getting into that executive level and I realised that I still don't see that in the UK.  I'm 51 years old this year, and coming back to the UK to make this programme, I would have thought that things would have got better, I presumed that black people would by now have gone on to university and got into the private sector, the boardrooms and managerial roles. But when I looked at the data is was very sobering. It took the wind out of my sails.Will Britain Ever Have A Black Prime Minister? was made for BBC Two as part of the Black and British season - watch the documentary and read more about the research. As many as 45% of all black children here are growing up in poverty compared to 25% of white children, according to government statistics. That has an impact on their early development - by the time they start school, the vocabulary of the poorest children lags more than a year behind that of wealthy children. White pupils are more likely to get three As at A level, and a state-educated black boy is more likely to be excluded from school than get three As. While we were making the programme, I met Aisha who is a very optimistic, spirited young black girl from south London. She's part of a generation that is aspirational, looking forward, wanting to better themselves. I think that's very inspiring. Aisha is hoping to go to Oxford University, and as far as she's concerned, it's a case of getting the grades, applying and being accepted.But we found evidence that black students were less likely to be offered places at top universities than white students who have the same predicted grades - that's according to research by Dr Vikki Boliver at Durham University.People who have overcome difficult backgrounds and all the obstacles of the inner-city world and attained the grades should be viewed as tenacious, strong and determined. But Boliver thinks there could be an ""unconscious bias"" in the admissions process. Whether you want to call it unconscious bias or institutional racism, let's all acknowledge there's a problem and make it better. Being defensive on this issue is getting us nowhere. It's deeply frustrating and slightly annoying to me as to why we're finding it so difficult to reach those higher echelons. We still don't have any black judges in the Supreme Court or High Court, or generals in the British army, for example.  We're still not taking charge. It's partly down to the education system and partly because we have to filter ourselves through this very British system. I was surprised at that. I do think we need to have some kind of radical change, perhaps legislatively, because I don't think it's happening of its own volition fast enough. I'm not sure we've discussed how to do that in terms of politics and business and society. I've got two daughters and hope that they will go on to have bright futures and be able to access that higher level. As far as a black prime minister goes and who it would be, I think it'll happen very suddenly. Somebody will be on the ballot and everybody will go: ""This guy ticks all the boxes."" But first of all we have to get more black people into politics - only 2% of our MPs are black, while black people make up 4% of the wider population. Hopefully a voice will emerge that puts everybody at ease and makes everybody excited, just like Barack Obama did in the US. Maybe in the next 10 years somebody will come up who has that fire, who is unafraid, who is articulate, who can stand up and be the one.

Theresa May said the 33-strong delegation had sealed deals worth £1bn, laying the groundwork for more than 1,300 jobs in the UK.Mrs May even donned a sari on a visit to a Hindu temple in the southern city of Bangalore, mixing the traditional with the modern. Bangalore has now become an important IT base for many other countries.Yet in India, they're not so sure. Her reception was polite, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi granting her an unusually long meeting of 90 minutes, but there are now significant tensions in the relationship which three days of photo opportunities will not resolve.Lord Bilimoria, the Indian-born businessman who created Cobra beer, has been on many of these trade trips stretching back 20 years, with both Conservative and Labour prime ministers.On The World This Weekend on Radio 4, he told me that Indian companies had invested more in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. They've seen it as the bridge to the EU. As a result of Brexit, that bridge is about to be broken, so having good links with the UK will become less important.That means India could, in future, see Britain as a less essential trade partner, just as the UK needs its enormous market even more.The problem is exacerbated by British decisions about immigration. The treatment of Indians who have studied in the UK and want to remain, and those who come as tourists or to work, rankles the Indian government. It's Mrs May herself who's blamed. At the Home Office, she presided over an increasingly restrictive policy, in contrast with the Cameron government's treatment of wealthy Chinese, who have seen many obstacles to their entry removed.Leaving Europe could improve the situation. As home secretary, Mrs May cut back on non-EU migration, to try to meet the challenging target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands of people. She's powerless to cut the numbers of citizens from other EU countries coming to the UK. Post-Brexit, she could spread the reduction more evenly.As president of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, Lord Bilimoria told me that a particular source of tension is over the treatment of students. ""The reality is Theresa May - when she was home secretary - did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration,"" he told me. ""We continue to include international students within our net migration figures,"" he added. ""The perception that sends out to the rest of the world, including India, is Britain wants to reduce the number of international students.""In that, the policy has been successful, with numbers falling from 40,000 to 20,000 in the last five years. Successful in British terms, perhaps, but Lord Bilmoria says, not to Indians. ""Theresa May as home secretary is the one who said that: 'I want international students to leave the day they graduate.' And the headlines in India at that time were: 'Take our money and then get out.'""In our interview, Lord Bilimoria revealed to me that last year David Cameron, then the prime minister, had suggested policy was about to change. ""David Cameron… told me personally in November: 'Karan, I think we should take international students out of the net migration figures.' It didn't happen.""  Whether he changed his mind, or lost a battle within Cabinet, the Indian government was very disappointed that no such announcement ever came.Nor did it this time. Theresa May did propose speeding up the application process for India's businesspeople, but said other changes would only be considered if the deportation of Indians who had overstayed their welcome in the UK could be speeded up.As for students, she said they were welcome, and pointed out that nine out of 10 student applicants did receive a visa. That may be true, but are there as many applications as there were in the past?Currency questions have been distracting Indians in the days since her visit, after the dramatic decision to cancel the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. So the average man or woman in India may not yet have fully absorbed Mrs May's visa resistance.There are reasons, then, to doubt how quickly India will want to reach a trade deal when Brexit happens. Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was optimistic that Britain's partners in the world outside the EU would jump at the chance, observing: ""We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen, and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny civil service. ""Are we really unable to do trade deals?""I quoted that to the Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suggesting that India would therefore be better disposed towards Britain than to some other countries. ""Well, I thought so and most of us in India thought so; but we aren't being treated as old friends any longer. It's a tight professional engagement,"" she said.In such relationships, calls to old loyalties or sentiment don't count for very much.You can hear The World This Weekend on Sunday lunchtimes at 13:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4, and via the BBC iPlayer."

When across the West the electoral pendulum swung reliably between parties of the centre left and centre right? There was consensus about the benefits of a global market economy. Politicians seemed to talk the same way, wear the same ties, parrot the same stale slogans. Meanwhile voters got on with shopping, and turning out at elections in ever decreasing numbers. This seemed to be the condition of liberal democracy at the start of 2016. But the seedbed for Brexit and Trump was there. As politics became the preserve of a professional office-seeking class the old parties shrank. Popular indifference and distrust of politics grew. A few years ago the political scientist Peter Mair argued that Western democracy was being hollowed out. With one referendum and a presidential election, liberal democracy as we've known it seems finally, dramatically, to have collapsed in on itself. Too hyperbolic? In response to Donald Trump's victory, the authoritarian, anti-immigration Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, said it was ""great news"" and claimed his victory marked the end of a period of ""liberal non-democracy"". This is the same Viktor Orban who was greeted with a mock-Nazi salute by the president of the European Commission at a summit last year. ""The dictator is coming,"" quipped Jean-Claude Juncker. Now many Western leaders are sweating. Last month the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the West's political values were in danger of breaking down. What does he think those values are? ""Human rights, civil liberties, including the freedom of speech and religion, free market and a competitive economy based on private property, reasonable and fair redistribution of goods, restrictions on power resulting from rules and tradition, tolerance and political pluralism."" Mr Tusk said those who questioned liberal democracy were happy about Brexit, looked up to President Putin and supported Donald Trump. And it's true that from the coffee shops of Brooklyn to the bistros of Brussels there is a sense of melancholy and foreboding. For people who have enjoyed the political stability and economic opportunities delivered by decades of liberal democracy these are bewildering, unsettling times. ""How"", they ask, ""can Britain possibly have voted to leave the EU?"" Millions of despairing Americans are grappling with the prospect of President Donald Trump. ""Is Le Pen next?"" they fret in the cafes of Paris. But for voters who cast ballots for Brexit and Donald Trump it feels like politics has finally listened to them. The ""left behind"" economic narrative does not account for the full variety of forces behind this new populism. But in the view of Parag Khanna, an American professor in Singapore and author of the new book Connectography, 2016 will be remembered as the year that ""the global underclass revolt crystallised in the form of the Brexit and the Trump election"".""This uncoordinated movement really began with Occupy Wall Street and has now claimed its biggest scalp,"" he says.Prof Vernon Bogdanor, at King's College London, agrees. ""There is a division between the exam-passing classes who are not hostile to the global elite and the left behind who are nationalist and protectionist,"" he says.""It takes different forms in different countries but it's now a fairly common phenomenon in Europe and America.""Prof Bogdanor tells me the new political cleavage is not between left and right but between nationalist populism and those perceived as ""elites"". And he is worried.""The election of Donald Trump is the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It's not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s. We're seeing a pale imitation of what we saw then"", he says, while careful to make clear he doesn't consider the president-elect a fascist. But Claire Fox, the director of the Institute of Ideas, thinks the vitality of liberal democracy has been proved by the Brexit and Trump results. ""We have to be careful of an anti-democratic response to perfectly legitimate democratic votes. Quite a lot of liberals are saying, 'well, democracy is not working so well because people are voting in a way we don't want them to vote', which strikes me as a supreme irony."" A suffocating political and cultural consensus has driven the backlash we are seeing now, she believes. ""There has been arguably far less tolerance over the last 10 years for anyone who doesn't agree with what a particular elite outlook is - and a silence or demonising of people who don't go along with the narrative."" Ms Fox cites public concern about immigration as a prime example and she also takes exception to the suggestion liberal democracy is being threatened by an ugly authoritarianism. ""The whole of the establishment, from army generals to big business, lined up to say Brexit was a mistake,"" she argues. ""What's authoritarian is employers turning round to their workers and saying jobs would be lost. ""We had an elite who thought they could call a referendum, mobilise everybody who should go and vote as they were told. That's caused a massive tantrum amongst the elite who then have the nerve to say it's the people's fault for threatening democracy.""Whether or not this political upheaval should be celebrated or feared, it feels like a rupture with the past. We are rumbling over an important set of points with little idea where we are heading. Brexit and Trump promised political control to people who felt their lives had little of it, who were furious at the gulf between their political rulers and the governed and mourned the social cohesion of the past, and whose voices were not heard much in the media. In the raucous, angry echo chamber of social media a fight back brewed. The flipside seems to be growing intolerance of pluralism and difference. That is why people like Donald Tusk anxiously wonder how Western liberal democracy can respond and survive. Because there is nothing inevitable about its continuity. As author and political philosopher John Gray wrote recently, plenty of authoritarian regimes in the world are doing well. The middle class in Russia appears wedded to a combination of consumerism and nationalism and in China many want nothing more than rising living standards and freedom in their private lives. ""Liberal societies cannot depend on history for their survival,"" he says in a New Statesman article. ""They need to defend themselves."" At the moment however, the winners from globalisation and the political elites have lost and the dissenters have won. "
2016-11-14,Voter revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115034542/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUS voters have delivered a blow to the political establishment by electing outsider Donald Trump to the presidency, much like UK voters did earlier this year when they opted to leave the EU. But just how close are the parallels between Tuesday's result and June's referendum? Were the voters who gave Mr Trump his victory much the same as those who voted to leave the EU? For many on this side of the Atlantic, there was a strong sense of deja vu on Tuesday night as it gradually emerged that Donald Trump has pulled off a dramatic victory. It all seemed reminiscent of the drama that British voters had experienced when in the small hours of 24 June it became apparent that a majority had voted to leave the European Union.One reason of course was that neither result had been expected. In the UK most - though not all - polls put Remain narrowly ahead. In the US most - though again not quite all - polls put Hillary Clinton narrowly in the lead. Read carefully, neither set of polls could in fact be said to point to a clear winner, but most commentators had convinced themselves that Remain and Mrs Clinton respectively would emerge victorious.But another arguably more important reason for the sense of deja vu was the similarity between some of Donald Trump's key campaign messages and those of the Leave campaign. Both majored on concerns about immigration. Both questioned whether the existing global financial order necessarily benefitted the ordinary man in the street. And both portrayed themselves as the underdogs campaigning against an allegedly complacent and out of touch political establishment.In the UK these stances have been shown to appeal in particular to the so-called ""left behind"", that is, voters who feel they have lost out economically in recent years and who are uncomfortable with some of the social changes that have been going on around them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was remarkably successful in such mid-West Rust Belt states as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, where the decline of manufacturing industry has seemingly created a part of America that can also be said to have been ""left behind"". There are certainly some striking similarities between the UK and US voting trends. To begin with, older voters in the UK were inclined to vote to leave the EU, whereas a majority of younger voters were in favour of remaining, according to exit poll data. Similarly, in the US Mrs Clinton was ahead among younger voters, while Mr Trump was more likely to be preferred by older citizens.At the same time, an educational divide was apparent in both ballots. In the UK, polls suggested a majority of university graduates were keen on remaining in the EU, while those without a degree voted to leave. Equally, in the US, exit polls indicate college graduates were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton, whereas those who were not college graduates inclined towards Donald Trump.Moreover, this educational divide was one of the most remarkable features of the US election. Republican candidates do not usually do better among non-graduates than graduates. In 2012 the level of support for the then-Republican standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, was almost exactly the same in the two groups. Here perhaps is the strongest evidence that Mr Trump's campaign messages had a particular resonance for a certain section of the US population that might also be described as ""left behind"".However, perhaps the analogy should not be pushed too far. A closer look at graphic above reveals that the education divide in the EU referendum was rather sharper than that in the US election.In the UK the gap was wide - around three-fifths of graduates voted to remain, while 63% of non-graduates cast a vote for leaving. In the US it was more nuanced - only just over half of college graduates voted for Mrs Clinton and only just over half of non-graduates backed Mr Trump.Moreover, in other respects the claim that it was the ""left behind"" who took Mr Trump to victory does not match the evidence.  In the UK those who voted to leave often had few, if any, educational qualifications, but also tended to be on lower incomes. Around two-thirds of those with incomes of less than £20,000 ($25,000) a year voted to leave, while around three in five of those earning more than £40,000 ($50,000) backed staying in the EU.But Mr Trump was not particularly successful among low-income voters. In fact, just over half of those with incomes of less than $30,000 (£24,000) voted for Mrs Clinton. Conversely, those on more than $100,000 (£80,000) a year only preferred Mr Trump by the narrowest margins. Mr Trump's campaign messages may have enabled him to reach out to voters with few, if any, qualifications for whom social issues such as immigration are often a particular concern. However, it appears he was less successful at mobilising support among those who might be thought to be economically left behind.There are other parallels between the vote in the US and that in the UK too, though in the case of the US at least they reflect political differences that long predate Mr Trump. The Republican president-elect was well ahead among white voters, but trailed Mrs Clinton heavily amongst the remainder of America's increasingly diverse population. In the UK too, black and minority ethnic voters were disinclined to vote to leave, put off perhaps by the Leave campaign's focus on the issue of immigration.Meanwhile, evangelical Protestants once again turned out for the Republican nominee in very strong numbers, while those who do not profess any religion at all voted heavily for Mrs Clinton.In the UK, too, those who do not claim to belong to any religion - a much larger group than in the US - were inclined to vote to remain. However, the religious divide in the UK largely reflects the fact that younger voters are more likely not to claim some kind of religious identity, rather than having much to do with their religious outlook itself.US elections have also long been marked by a gender difference, with women being more likely to vote Democrat, men to support the Republicans. That, too, was also in evidence on Thursday. That was one divide that was not evident at all in the UK referendum - men and women voted in much the same way. It seems that Mr Trump still has much to learn from UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, now UK foreign secretary, when it comes to wooing women voters.

2016-11-14,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115034542/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The report criticises Mrs May, who it says is ""acquiring a reputation of drawing in decisions and details to settle matters herself"" - an approach it describes as being ""unlikely to be sustainable"".The Times says the document also identifies cabinet splits between Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Brexit Secretary David Davis and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox on one side, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark on the other.According to the newspaper, the memo said: ""Every department has developed a 'bottom-up' plan of what the impact of Brexit could be - and its plan to cope with the 'worst case'.""Although necessary, this falls considerably short of having a 'government plan for Brexit' because it has no prioritisation and no link to the overall negotiation strategy.""The memo also suggests the government does not have enough officials to implement Brexit quickly, while departments are developing individual plans resulting in ""well over 500 projects"".It estimates an additional 30,000 extra civil servants could be required to meet the workload.The document also says big businesses could soon ""point a gun at the government's head"" to secure what they need to maintain jobs and investment.It comes after Japanese car manufacturer Nissan said it had been given ""support and assurances"" over trading conditions once Britain leaves the EU.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Grayling said the document was not a government memo and rejected its contents.""My own experience is very different to that,"" he said.Mr Grayling said negotiations would be ""complex but by no means the challenge that is set out in today's newspaper story"".Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell is due to say that the government's ""shambolic"" approach to Brexit is failing to equip the UK economy for leaving the EU.In a speech later, he will say the chancellor is isolated from cabinet colleagues and ""too weak"" to make Brexit a success.However, he will also say Labour will not attempt to block or delay the triggering of Article 50 in Parliament.""To do so would put Labour against the majority will of the British people and on the side of certain corporate elites, who have always had the British people at the back of the queue,"" he will say.The government is appealing against a High Court ruling that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50.The government's appeal is due to be heard at the Supreme Court from 5 December."

2016-11-15,HS2 northern routes are confirmed,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37981840,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has confirmed the route for the second phase of the high-speed rail line HS2, from Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds.However, the plan does not include a final decision over where to site a new station in or near Sheffield.The government's preferred option is for the main HS2 route to run east of Sheffield, but for a spur to take passengers to Sheffield city centre. Another spur will take HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport.The announcement confirms that the government intends to push ahead with the controversial infrastructure project. Critics of the £56bn project say it is a white elephant that will spoil some of Britain's most beautiful countryside. But the government says the new rail infrastructure will boost the economy by billions of pounds. The announcement removes much of the uncertainty over the project, except over where to site Sheffield's station.The original proposal was for trains from Birmingham to Leeds to stop at a new station built at Meadowhall, Sheffield's out-of-town shopping centre situated close to the M1 motorway.After complaints that this would disadvantage Sheffield, an alternative option was developed to use the existing city centre station.""The issue has been, do we build a line that passes on the edge of Sheffield to a very complex new station at  Meadowhall alongside the shopping centre,"" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC's Today Programme. ""Or do we do what Sheffield City Council requested, which is to take trains into the centre of Sheffield to Sheffield Midland station.""The provisional proposal is for the main HS2 line to run east of both Sheffield and Meadowhall towards Leeds, but to use the existing rail network to create a spur that runs through Sheffield city centre. Mr Grayling made it clear that this was the government's preferred option. It would cost about £1bn less and be easier to construct, but he said there had been no final decision.""It's the first time we've published that route formally. It has to be consulted upon, but that is our provisional judgement that that is what should happen,"" he added.A final decision will not be made until next year.The first phase of the £56bn railway is due to open in December 2026 and will see trains travel at high speed between London and Birmingham before continuing on the existing West Coast Main Line.The second Y-shaped phase, taking the high-speed line to Yorkshire, north-west England, and beyond, is due to be completed by about 2032-33.Mr Grayling said support and compensation would be available to those affected by the project.But communities on the proposed new route in South Yorkshire still voiced strong objections. If the route goes ahead, the newly built Shimmer Estate in Mexborough is likely to be cleared to make way for HS2, causing anger amongst residents.""It may be a new estate, but it's a proper community. For that to be destroyed is devastating. But the uncertainty, waiting until it happens, when you can actually put something in place to move, is horrible as well,"" Russell Holmes, who lives on the estate, told the BBC.Jonathan Pile of Yorkshire Against HS2 said the proposed route was ""unsuitable, should be struck out and was unfit for purpose"". It's a couple of years overdue, but the government has finally said where it wants to put the top half of HS2. Almost.The biggest hold-up has been what to do with Sheffield - and it's still a bit up in the air.The original plan was to build a new out-of-town station at the Meadowhall shopping centre.But plenty of people said it was too far away, so HS2 suggested sending trains into the existing city centre station instead. That would save £1bn - but the new proposal also cuts through a brand new housing estate near Doncaster that isn't even finished. Ed Miliband is the local MP and he is not best pleased.The decision is still open to consultation, so they won't make a final call until next year.Pressure group Stop HS2 said the announcement confirmed that once the high-speed railway was operating, existing intercity services to London would be reduced by up to two trains an hour.Joe Rukin, Stop HS2 campaign manager, said ministers were ""trying to con the public"" that the high-speed line was needed to boost rail capacity.""The government have finally come clean in admitting 'freeing up capacity' means for many cities 'losing the trains you already have', as the HS2 business case demands £8.3bn worth of cuts to existing services,"" he said.The National Audit Office warned in June that the HS2 project had an ""unrealistic timetable"" and faced major cost pressures.The scheme's schedule was too ambitious and rising costs could mean that not all its intended benefits were delivered, the NAO said."

And we need a serious commitment from government to invest across the whole of our country.""Tom Bateman, BBC political correspondentSince the EU referendum, the Treasury has steered away from the tougher deficit reduction rules imposed by former Chancellor George Osborne. It has chosen instead to speak of a ""pragmatic"" approach to balancing the books, given what Philip Hammond described as the ""turbulence"" that Brexit may bring. But his Labour opponent will today condemn this approach as weak, arguing the government must go further and end austerity rather than postpone it. Mr McDonnell is also likely to call for a focus on borrowing to create jobs and infrastructure - a policy he has previously said would go alongside a rule to balance day-to-day taxation and spending. Labour knows its task is to present itself to voters as credible on the economy, as the battle lines are set out before the first major economic announcement of Theresa May's government next week. Mr McDonnell will accuse Mr Hammond of lacking influence over the process of withdrawing from the EU, saying: ""The CEO of Nissan probably knows more about our Brexit negotiating position than the chancellor.""""Britain cannot afford a weak chancellor who cannot find his voice, when our country faces the biggest economic challenges for a generation. It's time he steps up to the task and stands up to his cabinet colleagues.""However, Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour had ""zero credibility when it comes to the economy"".""They drove Britain to the brink of bankruptcy last time, opposed everything we did to clear up the mess - and now all they offer is a recipe for economic ruin.""Ordinary working people would pay the price for Jeremy Corbyn's fantasy economics.""It comes as the Institute of Directors (IoD) called on Mr Hammond to ""act decisively"" and use the Autumn Statement to introduce tax breaks to boost investment.It released survey figures indicating business confidence had declined in recent weeks, with 50% of the 1,071 respondents asked between 12 and 27 October saying they were pessimistic about the economy over the next 12 months.Some 30% said they were optimistic.IoD director general Simon Walker said: ""This is a moment for the government to act decisively to make it easier for firms to expand and find more opportunities. ""We know that there isn't a limitless source of funds, so we urge the chancellor to make tax changes that incentivise investment, alongside targeted infrastructure investment."""

2016-11-15,Scotland could seek 'Norway model' on EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37976004,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkScotland could seek to become a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) when the UK leaves the EU, BBC Scotland has learned.The so-called Norway model has been privately floated as a possibility as the Scottish government seeks ways to maintain Scotland's links with the EU.  BBC Scotland's political editor Brian Taylor said the plan could give EU citizens the right to work in Scotland. But it could only happen if the UK and European institutions agreed.The idea emerged as a leaked memo about Brexit claimed splits in the UK cabinet mean there is still no overall plan for leaving the EU.But Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was not a government memo, and he rejected its contents.A UK government source said the document was an unsolicited pitch for work from a consultancy firm.The Scottish government has said it will publish plans aimed at protecting Scotland's place in Europe in the coming weeks. The EEA includes the existing EU states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.Membership of the EEA allows Norway to have full access to the single market, with the country obliged to make a financial contribution to the EU budget and to accept the majority of EU laws.Norwegians also have free movement across the EU, with EU citizens free to live and work in Norway too, but the country is not part of the customs union, so it is able to set tariffs for other countries Norway is exempt from EU rules on agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs - but the downside is that Norwegians have no say over how the rules of the single market are created.Supporters of Scotland attempting to secure EEA membership say it would allow people from EEA countries to work in Scotland even if they faced constraints elsewhere in the UK.  They argue that people employed in Scotland are already identified by a distinct tax code because of Holyrood's new tax powers. But the UK government might take some convincing if ministers feared it could lead to back door access to the wider UK through Scotland.The idea emerged as Holyrood prepared to debate a Scottish government motion urging MSPs to back Scotland staying within the European single market.The motion calls on Scotland's place in the single market to be ""fully protected"", and calls for clarity from the UK government on its proposals to leave the EU, including whether it will seek continued membership of the single market.There is a discussion going on in government, there is a discussion going on among advisors, there's a discussion going on in Scotland. I wouldn't really say it has emerged as a ministerial idea at this stage, but it is kicking around fairly seriously.The idea being suggested is that perhaps the UK as a whole could join the European Economic Area, which consists of the EU members plus Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland. They adopt the four freedoms of the EU - goods, services, capital and labour - but they're not in the customs union, which means they can set tariffs for other countries around the world.But if it is not the UK then could it be Scotland? Could there be an agreement - it would have to be via the UK, the existing member state, and the European institutions - that allows Scotland to join the EEA?The big snag for Scotland, among many snags, is that it is autonomous states who are members of the EEA.Now, those who support this idea say the European institutions are remarkably flexible and they can find a way around it. It would have to be, though, with agreement with the UK - that is the core of the thing. That is why so much of Nicola Sturgeon and Michael Russell's efforts are predicated upon getting the UK to agree to whatever emerges as the shape of the post-Brexit UK in Scotland. Speaking ahead of the debate, SNP MSP Bruce Crawford said the UK government was ""mired in confusion"" over questions such as whether the UK and Scotland should be in the single market.   He added: ""Every area of Scotland voted to remain in the EU and today's debate is an opportunity for the Tories and all other parties to reject a hard Brexit and stand up for Scotland.   ""At this crucial stage while the UK government is still working out its negotiating position, this is the time to make Scotland's voice heard and challenge head-on those who want to lead us out of the single market, with all the costs to Scottish jobs and the economy.""Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser challenged the Scottish government to set out exactly what it wants from Brexit.Mr Fraser said: ""You would think nearly five months on from the Brexit vote, after all the attention paid to this issue by the first minister and her cabinet, we might be a little further forward.""But there is still absolutely no clarity on where the Scottish government stands on these matters, while all the time it demands absolute clarity from the UK government which is conducting the negotiation.""Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the UK could be ""divided"" over its approach to EU membership.He said: ""We get the best deal when we negotiate together, and we have got to respect the democratic decision in the referendum.""In different constituencies, different regions, there were different views, but the overall view unfortunately was to withdraw from the EU.""Let's work together constructively to get the best deal possible. What we need to do is make sure the Scottish government is working with the UK government overall.""It comes as a report prepared for Holyrood's economy committee estimated that Scotland could face further cuts in a Brexit ""growth shock"".Economic think-tank IPPR Scotland said that if UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond uses public spending cuts to plug the whole of the £25bn UK budget gap per year by 2019/20 projected by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), it would cause a further £1.3bn cut to Scottish funds.The scenario was one of three modelled by the think-tank, which also examined the impact of Westminster using public spending to deal with half or quarter of the budget gap - found to cause £670m and £330m further cuts to the Scottish settlement.IPPR Scotland director Russell Gunson said: ""Any further cuts to day-to-day spending in the rest of the UK could mean cuts for Scotland's budgets too, on top of very significant cuts already planned over the coming years."""

Labour said Mrs May had ""no plan"" for life in a post-Brexit world.Speaking at London's Guildhall, Mrs May told the audience of leading business figures she envisaged a stronger role for government in developing an industrial strategy aimed at spreading wealth more evenly across the country.She said that, after Mr Trump's victory in the US presidential election, ""change is in the air"", adding: ""To be the true global champion of free trade in this new modern world, we also need to do something to help those families and communities who can actually lose out from it.""Not standing inflexibly, refusing to change and still fighting the battles of the past, but adapting to the moment, evolving our thinking and seizing the opportunities ahead.""That is the kind of leadership we need today. And I believe that it is Britain's historic global opportunity to provide it.""Mrs May said leaving the EU showed ""how a free, flexible, ambitious country can step up to a new global role"".""This is a new direction - a new approach to managing the forces of globalisation so that they work for all - and it is the course on which the government I lead has embarked,"" she said.Mrs May cited the UK's recent agreement to keep Nissan car production in the north-east of England and the development of a global hub to repair and maintain fighter aircraft in Wales as evidence of a competitive industrial strategy.Mrs May, who has called for more employee representatives on company boards and greater disclosure about corporate pay, also pledged to crack down on unfair business practices which ""undermine faith in capitalism and free markets"".The Guildhall speech is one of the major foreign policy and security addresses which the prime minister makes every year.Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI business group, said: ""It's encouraging to see the government make a robust case for free trade. Working with business, it can ensure that the benefits help drive productivity, and increase living standards in all parts of the country.""But, for Labour, shadow lord president of the council Jon Trickett said: ""Theresa May ‎has spent the early days of her time in Number 10 giving speeches about spreading opportunity and providing leadership but her actions have betrayed her.""She talks about leading Europe. But has no plan for Brexit. She talks about extending opportunity. But Britain's working people are worse off. And she talks about transforming the economy. But all that is on offer is more cuts, poor investment and little, if any, growth.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""Theresa May is trying to have her cake and eat it.  She talks about being pro-business but won't offer the one thing business leaders needs most: clarity on her plans for Britain's future with Europe. She can't have it both ways.""Meanwhile, Nigel Farage's meeting with US president-elect Mr Trump over the weekend meant he was the first British politician to meet Mr Trump since his election.Some Conservatives are questioning Mrs May's refusal to entertain any role for the interim UKIP leader in building links with the US administration, but a Downing Street source played down any disquiet.The source said any involvement for Mr Farage was ""categorically not going to happen"", adding: ""Farage is doing a very good PR job of trying to make himself seem indispensible.""Asked whether he would hire Mr Farage to improve links with Mr Trump, former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV's The Agenda: ""Absolutely not. I mean, Theresa May is a very sensible person who is not going to do that.""The British prime minister or the British government cannot contract its foreign policy out to Nigel Farage.""Mrs May's spokeswoman told reporters the relationship between Mr Trump and the PM was ""working well"" following an initial phone call that was ""very warm in tone"".Arriving in Brussels for a meeting with his EU counterparts, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson there was ""a lot to be positive about"" following Mr Trump's election.""It is very important not to pre-judge the president-elect or his administration,"" he added."

He said the ex-prime minister had to hold the vote to overcome threats from UKIP and rebellious Conservative MPs.The 23 June vote went against Mr Cameron and he resigned the next day.His apparent calm afterwards showed his ""instinct was to be the leader"" and not that he was ""chillaxed about it"", Sir Craig told an audience in London.The promise of a referendum was part of the Conservatives' 2015 general election manifesto, meaning that when the party won a majority it was duty-bound to hold it.Sir Craig, who worked for Mr Cameron from 2011 until this year, said: ""If David Cameron had ignored the calls for a referendum, a great boulder would have been placed in the road of British politics.""He told the audience at the London School of Economics: ""A referendum in this country was inevitable.""The Remain campaign, which Mr Cameron backed, lost by 51.9% to 48.1%, leading critics to question why the referendum was promised in the first place.Asked if the former prime minister had been ""too relaxed"" following the vote, Sir Craig said: ""His natural instinct was to be the leader - in charge. That's not being chillaxed about it.""He was also critical of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's role in the the Remain campaign, saying he had not helped Mr Cameron ""get over the line"", as he had assumed the side would win and he did not want to help the Conservatives.Mr Cameron stood down as an MP in September."

It's not a punishment. It's an uncomfortable consequence for Britain.""Mr Danjean told Analysis: ""When it comes to border management, we will have to find a new agreement, definitely, because you can't make as if nothing has happened.""And we all know that the vote for Brexit was mainly expressed because of migration and immigration issues. So, it has an impact and we cannot continue like this.""I cannot imagine a French politician and a French president telling people, 'Well, you know, the Brits have decided to leave but we have to enforce the border at our border'. This would be very hard to explain.""""On this very important issue of border management, an effort should be made also on the British side.""Despite Mr Juppe's statements about moving border checks, Downing Street has said it expects the Le Touquet agreement to continue. Asked to respond to the comments from No 10, Mr Danjean said: ""I can understand the position, but I'm not sure it's a sustainable one.""The Le Touquet treaty allowed the UK and France to set up immigration controls in each other's Channel ports. It was worked out between the two countries, rather than being a European Union arrangement.Without the agreement, UK officials would have to wait until people and vehicles arrived in the country.But several senior French politicians say the build-up of thousands of refugees and migrants on the French side of the Channel has caused the country damage. Mr Juppe described it as ""disastrous "" for France's image, while having ""extremely serious economic and security consequences for the people of Calais"".But the UK government has said it is ""committed to working together to protect our shared border in Calais"" and to maintaining the current controls.Florian Philippot, head of strategy and communication for the anti-immigration National Front (FN) party, said the Le Touquet agreement had been ""poorly negotiated"", but criticised the idea of moving the UK's Channel borders.""The problem with that is that there will be many dead in the Channel,"" he said. ""That seems obvious because migrants will want to cross, will be able to cross, since the border will be moved to Dover."""

""The estate is an important element of defence capability, enabling the armed forces to train and undertake operations, and providing accommodation for personnel and their families. ""The department's inability to invest sufficient funds may jeopardise the delivery of new and existing capabilities.""The National Audit Office found constraints on funding had led to decisions that were ""poor value for money in the longer term"".This included the decision to sell and lease back the majority of service family accommodation which was now limiting the MoD's ability to manage it cost effectively.The NAO also criticised a deal made with Capita in 2014 that saw it become the MoD's ""strategic business partner"" to help it achieve savings.It said the private company had not ""performed adequately against agreed performance indicators"".Other problems highlighted include:The report said: ""The risks to military capability from the estate will continue unless further actions are taken to address the shortfall in funding to sustain the estate.""The MoD's estate currently accounts for 1.8% or 424,000 hectares of the total UK land mass. It plans to sell off 30% of its land by 2040. Last week, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon announced the MoD would be selling off another 56 bases and the money raised from sales would be reinvested back into defence.  The NAO acknowledged the MoD did now have a plan to modernise its estate. In a statement the MoD said ""we've outlined a long-term military-led strategy"" to invest £4bn in training facilities and better service accommodation. NAO said it will still have to find a further £8.5bn to bring its estate up to scratch. "

The European Parliament agreed in May to enhance the agency's mandate and improve the way it tackles cross-border crime and terrorism - but until now the UK was the only country not to have opted into the relevant agreement.Last month the National Crime Agency's David Armond warned said an ""immediate"", ""urgent"" decision was needed.The government said its decision to opt in was ""without prejudice"" to any negotiations over its future relationship with Europol when it leaves the EU.The Scottish government, which had been urging Home Secretary Amber Rudd to sign up, welcomed the announcement.But its cabinet secretary Michael Matheson added: ""While we welcome this decision, it only provides a temporary solution and protects our participation in Europol only while we remain part of the EU.""

2016-11-15,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-15,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Her replacement will be announced on 28 November. With nominations closed, who's running?The former UKIP deputy chairman launched her bid for the leadership saying she would make the party less ""toxic"" and aim to occupy the ""common sense centre"" ground.She told the BBC she would ""pour oil on troubled water"" after there had been ""a bit too much testosterone"" in UKIP"".Ms Evans was unable to compete in the last leadership election because of a temporary suspension, now lifted, after an internal dispute.A former Conservative councillor, she defected to UKIP in 2013 and is credited with presenting a softer, less abrasive side to the party.She wrote its 2015 election manifesto. But she is also mistrusted by sections of the party and accused one-time contest rival Raheem Kassam (who pulled out shortly before nominations closed) of seeking to take the party too far to the right. Paul Nuttall sees himself as the man to ""bring the factions together"" in UKIP and believes he has ""huge support"" among both the grassroots and the top of the party.The ex-party chairman, former deputy leader and Bootle-born MEP  did not stand for the big job in the summer, reportedly because of the effect that it would have on his family life.But launching his bid this time around, he told the BBC: ""I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.""That doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.""He said UKIP needed to come together as it was currently ""looking over the edge of a political cliff"". ""I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards,"" he said. ""We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.""The former soldier announced he'd be running for leader on Daily Politics. Mr Rees-Evans describes himself as ""a patriot who believes in the innate common sense of the British people."" He has not previously held an elected office - his attempt to win the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth at the 2015 general election resulted in a third-place finish. Another former leadership contender, Elizabeth Jones came last in the previous contest to replace Nigel Farage.Deputy chair of the party's Lambeth branch, she stood unsuccessfully in May's London Assembly elections and came fifth in last month's Tooting by-election.The family law solicitor is a member of the party's national executive committee but decided not to run this time around.A previously less well-known figure in Westminster circles, Lisa Duffy, a town and district councillor in Cambridgeshire, came second in the last leadership contest, with 4,591 votes out of 17,970.She won the backing of key modernising figures in the party such as Suzanne Evans - who was unable to take part in the contest due to a suspension - and MEP Patrick O'Flynn, for whom she is chief of staff.Ms Duffy is a former mayor of the town of Ramsey, and as campaigns director played a key role in fighting by-elections. She joined UKIP in 2004 and stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Hazel Blears in Salford in the 2005 general election. A former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, he left his role following a bout of infighting in the wake of the 2015 election and has been editor of the London edition of the Breitbart website.He hit out at what he described as ""chicanery and duplicity"" at the top echelons of the party and pledged to campaign for a ""strong, united UKIP free of Tory splitters"".He said he was the man to continue Mr Farage's legacy inside UKIP but pulled out of the contest shortly before nominations closed, claiming the top of the party was treating the contest ""like a coronation"", criticising his treatment by the media and saying he had not raised enough money to run anything beyond ""a digital campaign run from SW1"". Holding one of two UKIP seats as a London Assembly member, David Kurten sits on the transport, housing and environment committees and the education panel of the Assembly.Announcing his candidacy, he insisted UKIP remained a ""vital force"" in British politics and has vowed to ""not rest"" until the country is built up again after decades of ""embracing destructive ideologies of political correctness"". Before starting his career in politics, he was a chemistry teacher for 15 years.He pulled out of the contest the day before nominations closed on 31 October.Andrew Beadle was UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in the 2015 general election.He lost out in the Wallington South by-election of the same year.Mr Beadle said that UKIP ""needs a full time leader not a part-time caretaker"" and wants to drive the party forward with its ""potential"" and ""staggering ability"".Announced he was pulling out of the contest on 26 October.A Conservative activist before joining UKIP in 2011, Mr Etheridge has called for major reform of the penal system, including restricting prisoners' privileges, banning visits during the first six months of a sentence and an automatic 10-year increase in sentence for anyone attacking a prison officer.He has also called for far-reaching changes to the tax system, including a 50% cut in alcohol and tobacco duty, replacing VAT with a local sales tax and gradually merging national insurance and income taxes.On 25 October he announced he'd be abandoning his leadership campaign.The 49-year-old barrister was a front-runner in the contest - but withdrew, and resigned from UKIP, after a row with party colleagues.Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital after the clash with fellow MEP Mike Hookem in the European Parliament, with the two men giving conflicting verdicts on what happened.He was previously the bookies' favourite for the job, vowing to make UKIP ""the main opposition party"", to stand up for the ""ignored working class"" and to bring about a ""radically different political landscape in Britain for a generation"".But he will now see out his term as an independent MEP.The party's culture spokesman and most prominent gay representative has dropped out of the race to succeed Diane James.He previously told the the BBC UKIP was ""not going anywhere soon"" and insisted it was ""here to stay"".On 4 November Mr Whittle recommended that his supporters back Paul Nuttall instead, saying: ""UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board.""Douglas Carswell: The party's sole MP, who defected from the Conservatives in 2014, has repeatedly said the job of leader is not for himNeil Hamilton: The former Tory minister, who is leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly, has said he has no interest in becoming leader under any circumstances. Mr Farage, who has a fractious relationship with Mr Hamilton, has said this would be a ""horror story"". "
2016-11-15,Feeling insecure,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37972087,"Walk the normally staid, greying corridors of EU power in Brussels at the moment and you sense an unaccustomed buzz, a nervousness; there's a whiff of almost frenzied expectation.Change is in the air: exciting and emboldening for some, frightening for others.Imagine the EU in a bowling alley. Well, frankly, its pillars of stability have been falling like ninepins.Brexit, mass migrant arrivals, Russian activity in Ukraine, cross-border Islamist terror (with the Paris attacks anniversary at the weekend), and now the election of Donald Trump as US president, with all the implication that may have for European politics, trade, security and defence.The UK foreign secretary may dismiss it as a ""whinge-o-rama"" and Hungary's government may mutter about ""exaggerated panic"", but EU leaders - and their foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday - have a list of clear-cut concerns about President-elect Trump.More on what Trump means for Europe:Mr Trump's America-first attitude, his comments appearing to question Nato's founding all-for-one-and-one-for-all clause and his apparent admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin have Europeans worried about defence and security, about Syria, about the Iran nuclear deal and about Europe itself. The Russia-fearing Eastern and Baltic countries feel particularly exposed.Yes, Donald Trump's commitment to Nato worries them but they're also apprehensive about changes in political tone towards Russia - not just in the US but here in Europe too.Resurgent anti-establishment, populist parties across the continent - in France, Italy, Austria and beyond - applaud Mr Trump and have established links with Russia.Far-right French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen, well-known for relations with Moscow, said she had accepted an invitation to work with Mr Trump. In Italy, the leader of the nationalist Northern League party told a crowd waving Russian and American flags that he was Italy's Trump.Now Russia-friendly candidates have won elections in Bulgaria and Moldova. And a party close to Moscow is making a power play in Estonia.     EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini is clearly worried.Once again, EU talk of a European Defence Union looms large.It's hardly a new idea - big powers France, Germany, Italy and Spain pushed loudly for it following the UK's Brexit vote in June - but now there's a sense of increased urgency.This is not about building an EU army, insist advocates (though some Europeans are in favour), but rather about sharing defence capabilities and moving towards increased self-reliance in an insecure world.The EU already has its own rapid reaction forces. One argument is that it should deploy them more assertively and effectively.Until now, the UK - one of only two significant military powers in the EU - consistently blocked any moves towards a common EU defence body but it has voted to leave the bloc.Still, to have a European defence union, you need unity amongst EU countries and there's little evidence of that amongst the fractious bunch of 28.When big power Germany hastily convened an EU foreign ministers' dinner in Brussels on Sunday night to discuss Donald Trump's victory, key players Britain and notably France didn't bother showing up.Nato ex-Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen dismisses any talk of the EU going down the defence path alone as ""a paper tiger"".And as much as Ms Mogherini asserts that the EU should be able to defend itself ""with the full potential of a superpower"", the bloc will continue to rely on the US and on Nato in particular.Not that long ago in Europe, mainstream politicians were wondering out loud about whether Nato was an out-dated organisation - hugely important in the shadow of World War Two but less significant in the 21st Century. But increasingly in the face of its multitude of crises - masses of migrants and asylum-seekers braving the Mediterranean to reach Europe, European cities under attack from cross-border Islamist terror and Russia flexing its muscles in the East - the EU has become increasingly reliant on Nato once again.Political memory is short."
2016-11-15,David Harewood,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37799305,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link Take two children born in the UK today - one black and one white. What are the chances of one of them becoming prime minister? The black child is 12 times less likely to make it, according to a BBC documentary presented by David Harewood. The actor, who starred in the TV drama Homeland, reflects on what he found and his own experience of being black and British.We don't like talking about race in the UK - it's a very sensitive subject. People get extremely defensive and run for the covers but I believe we have to talk about it. My parents came over from Barbados in the late 1950s and early 60s. My father was a lorry driver and my mum also worked. The area where I grew up in Birmingham was very diverse - I was aware of my race but not overly aware of it - and there seemed to be an understanding that we were all very much in the same boat.There weren't very many black people on TV then and most of my heroes were American or Caribbean. The West Indian cricket team were probably the most successful black people that I remember seeing. There was always a bit of a carnival in my house whenever they came over and beat England. That was our one chance to culturally celebrate some kind of black success. I was lucky to get into drama school and become a professional actor. No-one ever mentioned the colour of my skin. It's only when I came out of RADA - the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art - that I suddenly realised people started to refer to me as a black actor. Initially I found work very easily and then I just sort of fell off a cliff. There are lots of roles for young black men but very few roles for leading black men in the UK. No-one's writing those roles, no-one's commissioning those dramas as they are in America. I've spent the past five or six years in America where I can play leading, authoritative characters - such as the head of the CIA in Homeland. I've got used to turning on my TV and seeing black generals, sheriffs, chiefs of police, politicians, financial experts, political experts and news anchors. I'm used to seeing black people getting into that executive level and I realised that I still don't see that in the UK.  I'm 51 years old this year, and coming back to the UK to make this programme, I would have thought that things would have got better, I presumed that black people would by now have gone on to university and got into the private sector, the boardrooms and managerial roles. But when I looked at the data is was very sobering. It took the wind out of my sails.Will Britain Ever Have A Black Prime Minister? was made for BBC Two as part of the Black and British season - watch the documentary and read more about the research. As many as 45% of all black children here are growing up in poverty compared to 25% of white children, according to government statistics. That has an impact on their early development - by the time they start school, the vocabulary of the poorest children lags more than a year behind that of wealthy children. White pupils are more likely to get three As at A level, and a state-educated black boy is more likely to be excluded from school than get three As. While we were making the programme, I met Aisha who is a very optimistic, spirited young black girl from south London. She's part of a generation that is aspirational, looking forward, wanting to better themselves. I think that's very inspiring. Aisha is hoping to go to Oxford University, and as far as she's concerned, it's a case of getting the grades, applying and being accepted.But we found evidence that black students were less likely to be offered places at top universities than white students who have the same predicted grades - that's according to research by Dr Vikki Boliver at Durham University.People who have overcome difficult backgrounds and all the obstacles of the inner-city world and attained the grades should be viewed as tenacious, strong and determined. But Boliver thinks there could be an ""unconscious bias"" in the admissions process. Whether you want to call it unconscious bias or institutional racism, let's all acknowledge there's a problem and make it better. Being defensive on this issue is getting us nowhere. It's deeply frustrating and slightly annoying to me as to why we're finding it so difficult to reach those higher echelons. We still don't have any black judges in the Supreme Court or High Court, or generals in the British army, for example.  We're still not taking charge. It's partly down to the education system and partly because we have to filter ourselves through this very British system. I was surprised at that. I do think we need to have some kind of radical change, perhaps legislatively, because I don't think it's happening of its own volition fast enough. I'm not sure we've discussed how to do that in terms of politics and business and society. I've got two daughters and hope that they will go on to have bright futures and be able to access that higher level. As far as a black prime minister goes and who it would be, I think it'll happen very suddenly. Somebody will be on the ballot and everybody will go: ""This guy ticks all the boxes."" But first of all we have to get more black people into politics - only 2% of our MPs are black, while black people make up 4% of the wider population. Hopefully a voice will emerge that puts everybody at ease and makes everybody excited, just like Barack Obama did in the US. Maybe in the next 10 years somebody will come up who has that fire, who is unafraid, who is articulate, who can stand up and be the one.

2016-11-15,In the limelight,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37979406,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAll 11 senior judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom will decide the most significant British constitutional question for years - whether the government has the power to trigger Article 50 of the EU Lisbon Treaty to begin Brexit. It is unprecedented for all 11 Justices to sit for a single case and that is saying a lot for an institution that in one guise or another has existed for more than 600 years.    But, judging so far from the furore greeting the judiciary's involvement in Brexit, it may be a case of safety in numbers.Howls of protest and anger from Brexit-supporting politicians and newspapers greeted the decision by the High Court on 3 November that Parliament must vote on Article 50 before it can be triggered.But the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is highly unlikely to be swayed by such considerations when it starts its deliberations on 5 December.In an exclusive interview with the BBC, one of the judges, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, confessed to feeling unabashed by the predicted public and press interest in the case.""I think that it's not a question of my looking forward to it but I can perfectly well understand why the public is extremely interested in it,"" he told me. ""And that's a good thing. Our communications staff and our reception staff are well prepared to cater for that public interest and to ensure that as much facility for those who are interested in it is provided, so that the public can hear the arguments as they are presented. ""I think that's an entirely healthy thing. So I'm not particularly looking forward to the public interest but I'm certainly not disheartened by it.""The government appealed to the Supreme Court after a ""lower court"", in this case the High Court,  ruled that Parliament must vote before the triggering of Article 50. The High Court had upheld the challenge by businesswoman Gina Miller that Prime Minister Theresa May had no authority by use of the Royal Prerogative to start the process of the UK leaving the EU. Several Brexit-supporting newspapers attacked the decision, with the Daily Mail describing the judges as ""enemies of the people"".Lord Kerr declined to comment about the newspaper headlines but said: ""I think the important message that I would like to convey is that we as judges apply the law. ""We are not involved in reaching decisions based on anything other than the legal principles as they are presented to us and the legal analysis which we conduct as to these extremely difficult and complicated questions. ""That's not to say that we don't have personal views but we are all extremely conscious of the need to set aside our personal views and to apply the law as we conceive it to be.""The Supreme Court is based in Parliament Square next to both Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. The court formally began in October 2009 housed in a building previously used as a crown court. Before 1965 it was home to Middlesex County Council, which was officially abolished in a reorganisation of London's local government.  The Supreme Court took over the functions of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and its justices also sit as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and as such will occasionally hear appeals against the death penalty from Commonwealth countries.More than 100,000 people visit the court each year and more than 350 schools take part in tours and sit in on its many hearings. The building was refurbished to allow a lot of light and colour and houses a café, an exhibition area and even a rather funky carpet designed by Sir Peter Blake, who famously designed the cover for the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper Album. Former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion was commissioned to write a poem, which has been chiselled into stone benches outside the court building. In an average year, the Supreme Court hears around 90 appeals and makes around 80 judgements on important issues of law that shape the way everybody lives, while it also upholds and dismisses appeals in almost equal proportions. On either side of the Atlantic, there is much talk of elites. The Supreme Court is open but not at the moment as diverse or representative as it wishes to be. There is only one woman justice and Oxbridge and public schools feature prominently in the background of most of the justices. Lord Kerr concedes it is a problem, saying, ""Well we're not diverse enough in the sense that we don't reflect the gender balance of the community for a start.""Nor do we reflect the ethnic population of the United Kingdom and that's something that we are concerned about and that we're working towards. ""Curiously enough, I think possibly I represent a particular part of diversity in that I come from Northern Ireland first of all. ""Secondly I wasn't educated in a public school, I didn't go to Oxbridge, and I certainly don't lead a privileged life. ""I was one of a family of seven, of a widowed mother. Happily I was able to go to university but I don't think that I could be described - certainly in terms of background - as coming from an elite."" "

2016-11-15,India unmoved,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37950198,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe prime minister seemed pleased with the outcome of her trade visit to India. Theresa May said the 33-strong delegation had sealed deals worth £1bn, laying the groundwork for more than 1,300 jobs in the UK.Mrs May even donned a sari on a visit to a Hindu temple in the southern city of Bangalore, mixing the traditional with the modern. Bangalore has now become an important IT base for many other countries.Yet in India, they're not so sure. Her reception was polite, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi granting her an unusually long meeting of 90 minutes, but there are now significant tensions in the relationship which three days of photo opportunities will not resolve.Lord Bilimoria, the Indian-born businessman who created Cobra beer, has been on many of these trade trips stretching back 20 years, with both Conservative and Labour prime ministers.On The World This Weekend on Radio 4, he told me that Indian companies had invested more in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. They've seen it as the bridge to the EU. As a result of Brexit, that bridge is about to be broken, so having good links with the UK will become less important.That means India could, in future, see Britain as a less essential trade partner, just as the UK needs its enormous market even more.The problem is exacerbated by British decisions about immigration. The treatment of Indians who have studied in the UK and want to remain, and those who come as tourists or to work, rankles the Indian government. It's Mrs May herself who's blamed. At the Home Office, she presided over an increasingly restrictive policy, in contrast with the Cameron government's treatment of wealthy Chinese, who have seen many obstacles to their entry removed.Leaving Europe could improve the situation. As home secretary, Mrs May cut back on non-EU migration, to try to meet the challenging target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands of people. She's powerless to cut the numbers of citizens from other EU countries coming to the UK. Post-Brexit, she could spread the reduction more evenly.As president of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, Lord Bilimoria told me that a particular source of tension is over the treatment of students. ""The reality is Theresa May - when she was home secretary - did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration,"" he told me. ""We continue to include international students within our net migration figures,"" he added. ""The perception that sends out to the rest of the world, including India, is Britain wants to reduce the number of international students.""In that, the policy has been successful, with numbers falling from 40,000 to 20,000 in the last five years. Successful in British terms, perhaps, but Lord Bilmoria says, not to Indians. ""Theresa May as home secretary is the one who said that: 'I want international students to leave the day they graduate.' And the headlines in India at that time were: 'Take our money and then get out.'""In our interview, Lord Bilimoria revealed to me that last year David Cameron, then the prime minister, had suggested policy was about to change. ""David Cameron… told me personally in November: 'Karan, I think we should take international students out of the net migration figures.' It didn't happen.""  Whether he changed his mind, or lost a battle within Cabinet, the Indian government was very disappointed that no such announcement ever came.Nor did it this time. Theresa May did propose speeding up the application process for India's businesspeople, but said other changes would only be considered if the deportation of Indians who had overstayed their welcome in the UK could be speeded up.As for students, she said they were welcome, and pointed out that nine out of 10 student applicants did receive a visa. That may be true, but are there as many applications as there were in the past?Currency questions have been distracting Indians in the days since her visit, after the dramatic decision to cancel the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. So the average man or woman in India may not yet have fully absorbed Mrs May's visa resistance.There are reasons, then, to doubt how quickly India will want to reach a trade deal when Brexit happens. Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was optimistic that Britain's partners in the world outside the EU would jump at the chance, observing: ""We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen, and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny civil service. ""Are we really unable to do trade deals?""I quoted that to the Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suggesting that India would therefore be better disposed towards Britain than to some other countries. ""Well, I thought so and most of us in India thought so; but we aren't being treated as old friends any longer. It's a tight professional engagement,"" she said.In such relationships, calls to old loyalties or sentiment don't count for very much.You can hear The World This Weekend on Sunday lunchtimes at 13:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4, and via the BBC iPlayer."
2016-11-15,New era,https://web.archive.org//web/20161115110933/http://www.bbc.com/news/37949669,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkRemember when politics was rather dull? When across the West the electoral pendulum swung reliably between parties of the centre left and centre right? There was consensus about the benefits of a global market economy. Politicians seemed to talk the same way, wear the same ties, parrot the same stale slogans. Meanwhile voters got on with shopping, and turning out at elections in ever decreasing numbers. This seemed to be the condition of liberal democracy at the start of 2016. But the seedbed for Brexit and Trump was there. As politics became the preserve of a professional office-seeking class the old parties shrank. Popular indifference and distrust of politics grew. A few years ago the political scientist Peter Mair argued that Western democracy was being hollowed out. With one referendum and a presidential election, liberal democracy as we've known it seems finally, dramatically, to have collapsed in on itself. Too hyperbolic? In response to Donald Trump's victory, the authoritarian, anti-immigration Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, said it was ""great news"" and claimed his victory marked the end of a period of ""liberal non-democracy"". This is the same Viktor Orban who was greeted with a mock-Nazi salute by the president of the European Commission at a summit last year. ""The dictator is coming,"" quipped Jean-Claude Juncker. Now many Western leaders are sweating. Last month the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the West's political values were in danger of breaking down. What does he think those values are? ""Human rights, civil liberties, including the freedom of speech and religion, free market and a competitive economy based on private property, reasonable and fair redistribution of goods, restrictions on power resulting from rules and tradition, tolerance and political pluralism."" Mr Tusk said those who questioned liberal democracy were happy about Brexit, looked up to President Putin and supported Donald Trump. And it's true that from the coffee shops of Brooklyn to the bistros of Brussels there is a sense of melancholy and foreboding. For people who have enjoyed the political stability and economic opportunities delivered by decades of liberal democracy these are bewildering, unsettling times. ""How"", they ask, ""can Britain possibly have voted to leave the EU?"" Millions of despairing Americans are grappling with the prospect of President Donald Trump. ""Is Le Pen next?"" they fret in the cafes of Paris. But for voters who cast ballots for Brexit and Donald Trump it feels like politics has finally listened to them. The ""left behind"" economic narrative does not account for the full variety of forces behind this new populism. But in the view of Parag Khanna, an American professor in Singapore and author of the new book Connectography, 2016 will be remembered as the year that ""the global underclass revolt crystallised in the form of the Brexit and the Trump election"".""This uncoordinated movement really began with Occupy Wall Street and has now claimed its biggest scalp,"" he says.Prof Vernon Bogdanor, at King's College London, agrees. ""There is a division between the exam-passing classes who are not hostile to the global elite and the left behind who are nationalist and protectionist,"" he says.""It takes different forms in different countries but it's now a fairly common phenomenon in Europe and America.""Prof Bogdanor tells me the new political cleavage is not between left and right but between nationalist populism and those perceived as ""elites"". And he is worried.""The election of Donald Trump is the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It's not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s. We're seeing a pale imitation of what we saw then"", he says, while careful to make clear he doesn't consider the president-elect a fascist. But Claire Fox, the director of the Institute of Ideas, thinks the vitality of liberal democracy has been proved by the Brexit and Trump results. ""We have to be careful of an anti-democratic response to perfectly legitimate democratic votes. Quite a lot of liberals are saying, 'well, democracy is not working so well because people are voting in a way we don't want them to vote', which strikes me as a supreme irony."" A suffocating political and cultural consensus has driven the backlash we are seeing now, she believes. ""There has been arguably far less tolerance over the last 10 years for anyone who doesn't agree with what a particular elite outlook is - and a silence or demonising of people who don't go along with the narrative."" Ms Fox cites public concern about immigration as a prime example and she also takes exception to the suggestion liberal democracy is being threatened by an ugly authoritarianism. ""The whole of the establishment, from army generals to big business, lined up to say Brexit was a mistake,"" she argues. ""What's authoritarian is employers turning round to their workers and saying jobs would be lost. ""We had an elite who thought they could call a referendum, mobilise everybody who should go and vote as they were told. That's caused a massive tantrum amongst the elite who then have the nerve to say it's the people's fault for threatening democracy.""Whether or not this political upheaval should be celebrated or feared, it feels like a rupture with the past. We are rumbling over an important set of points with little idea where we are heading. Brexit and Trump promised political control to people who felt their lives had little of it, who were furious at the gulf between their political rulers and the governed and mourned the social cohesion of the past, and whose voices were not heard much in the media. In the raucous, angry echo chamber of social media a fight back brewed. The flipside seems to be growing intolerance of pluralism and difference. That is why people like Donald Tusk anxiously wonder how Western liberal democracy can respond and survive. Because there is nothing inevitable about its continuity. As author and political philosopher John Gray wrote recently, plenty of authoritarian regimes in the world are doing well. The middle class in Russia appears wedded to a combination of consumerism and nationalism and in China many want nothing more than rising living standards and freedom in their private lives. ""Liberal societies cannot depend on history for their survival,"" he says in a New Statesman article. ""They need to defend themselves."" At the moment however, the winners from globalisation and the political elites have lost and the dissenters have won. "

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

2016-11-16,Plans to curb Lords powers 'dropped',https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38008315,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPlans to curb the power of the House of Lords have been dropped by the government, sources have told the BBC. Former House of Lords leader Lord Strathclyde came up with a proposal to remove peers' veto over laws - called statutory instruments - after a series of government defeats last year.Sources say plans to remove the power from the Lords, where the Tories do not have a majority, have now been dropped. Labour peer Baroness Smith said the plan was an ""absurd overreaction"".The government announced its review into the workings of Parliament after  defeats in the House of Lords over controversial tax credit cuts.However, one source said it had now ""been dumped"". Another added: ""The world has changed.""The change of heart is another policy that was planned by former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne that Theresa May's government is abandoning. It has been suggested to the BBC that the change is part of Number 10's distancing itself from the previous administration, and part of its desire to pare back on any legislation that might be controversial when the government is likely to face resistance in Parliament over its plans for leaving the EU.  Sources have also suggested the government has been discussing ways of building a more constructive relationship with the Lords. Lord Strathclyde told the BBC it would be sensible if the government could find a way of working more effectively with opposition parties in the Lords without having to change the law, saying:  ""Legislation should be a last resort.""  Downing Street did not deny or confirm the suggestion saying: ""We will be publishing our response in due course.""Baroness Smith, Labour's leader in the Lords, said she welcomed the government's realisation that ""the Strathclyde review was an absurd overreaction to a sensible and principled challenge on tax credits""."

This follows the leak of a report written by consulting firm Deloitte on Tuesday, which suggested the number could be up to 30,000.Mr Corbyn said: ""Your ministers need to know. They are desperate for an answer from you.""The prime minister replied: ""We are doing the preparations necessary for the point at which we'll start the complex formal negotiations with the European Union.""She added: ""I have to say to you, from the confusion you've got on your benches in relation to this issue of Brexit, it's yet another example with Labour where they talk, we act, they posture, we deliver.""We're getting on with the job. You're not up to the job.""Mr Corbyn said the government was in a ""total shambles"" over Brexit, telling MPs: ""These are the most complex set of negotiations ever undertaken by this country.""The civil service has been cut down to its lowest level since the Second World War. The prime minister's main focus ought to be, surely, coming up with a serious plan.""But Mrs May said setting out every detail of the UK's negotiating strategy in advance to the other 27 EU member states would be the ""best possible way of ensuring we got the worst result for this country"", adding: ""That's why we won't do it.""Ministers say they are already able - under powers given conferred the royal prerogative - to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting formal Brexit talks with the EU under way.But campaigners who brought the case against the government say Parliament must have a vote. The High Court backed their argument earlier this month and the Supreme Court will consider the government's appeal against the decision from 5 December, with a ruling expected in January. "

She fell backwards into the ground and there was blood pouring down her face,"" she said.Asked whether the gunman had said anything, she replied: ""It was something along the lines of 'Keep Britain independent,' or 'British independence.'""Ms Major told jurors that Mrs Cox had tried to protect her staff even as she was being stabbed.""He was making motions towards us with the knife and Jo was lying in the road and she shouted out, 'Get away, get away you two. Let him hurt me. Don't let them hurt you.'""He started to walk away a little bit and when Jo shouted out then he came back. He shot her twice more and then started stabbing her again. ""She was on the floor. She didn't get up again. He was still shouting and shouting,"" the court heard. The court also heard from Ms Aswat who said she had screamed for help as a knifeman stood over the MP and pleaded for her to run.The man retreated but returned to continue the attack, as more people gathered round. She tried to hit him with her handbag, but missed, the court heard.Ms Aswat said she thought Mrs Cox had been stabbed first and then shot at close range.At the end of the attack, the assailant stood up and said ""Britain first, this is for Britain. Britain will always come first,"" before walking off, she told jurors.Ms Aswat said she held the injured Mrs Cox in her arms and tried to encourage her by talking about her two young children.The police only took two or three minutes to arrive but it felt like a lifetime, she told the court.In a statement read out in court, Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, described how he was injured as he tried to save Mrs Cox.He had been waiting for his wife outside the library when he heard a bang and saw Mrs Cox, who he recognised, roll into the road, the court heard.""I jumped out of the car. I thought if I could jump on to the back, I could take him down.""I thought he was thumping her until I saw the blood. I saw he had a knife in his hands.""Just as I got short of him, he turned around and saw me. He shoved the knife in and it hit me in the stomach. ""The blood started pouring out between my fingers. I saw the blood and I thought 'Oh my God.'""He described staggering away to a nearby sandwich shop, from where he could see the man ""going berserk with a knife"".Earlier on Wednesday, the court heard how police found a bag of bullets in Mr Mair's pocket when he was detained.Arresting officer PC Craig Nicholls also said he saw what looked like a gun in a bag and described Mr Mair putting his arms up and saying: ""It's me"".PC Nicholls told the court he and a colleague were in a patrol car when they followed Mr Mair into a cul-de-sac, and asked him to show his hands.As the man dropped his bag, the officers rugby tackled him to the ground. The man then told them: ""I'm a political activist"", PC Nicholls said.The jury heard a dagger-type knife, an EU referendum leaflet and a wallet containing cards, including a library card, were also found.The trial continues.Jo Cox was a self-proclaimed ""proud Yorkshire lass"" whose work for charity took her around the world and whose political success led her to Westminster.The 41-year-old mother-of-two was elected as MP for Batley and Spen in the 2015 election and increased Labour's majority to 6,051 (from 4,406 in the 2010 election).She described herself as ""proud and humbled"" to be the Labour MP for the place where she was born.Mrs Cox first worked in politics after graduating from Cambridge University in 1995, but then built a career working for charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the NSPCC.She was described by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as ""a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for justice and peace.""Tireless campaigner turned political 'star'"

The government says it does not want to reveal its negotiating hand before this happens.But, describing a conversation with Mr Johnson about the UK's preferred Brexit outcome, Mr Calenda, Italy's economic development minister, told Bloomberg TV: ""His idea is, 'We want to have access to the common market without giving you access in terms of free circulation of people,' and I think this is wishful thinking.""His answer was, 'OK, but you are selling a lot of what we call Prosecco in the UK... and you will allow us to do this because you don't want to lose Prosecco exports.'""I said, 'Maybe we're going to lose some Prosecco; you're going to lose some fish and chips exports. The difference is I'm going to lose [exports] to one country, you to 27.'""Putting things on this level is a bit insulting.""A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""The foreign secretary's comments reflect the strength of the trading relationship between the UK and Italy. ""We're looking to ensure this continues as we depart the EU."" Whitehall sources insisted that the comment about Prosecco had not been an insult but part of a ""constructive"" conversation.UK sales of Prosecco overtook those of champagne last year, reaching £339m in the 12 months to July, according to research company IRI.No figures on UK exports of fish and chips to the EU were immediately discovered by the BBC.Earlier, Mr Johnson reportedly told the Czech newspaper Hospodarske Noviny he did not believe the UK would remain in the EU customs union - which allows members to move goods without the imposition of tariffs on each other - after Brexit.He was quoted as saying he believed this could happen while ""maintaining free trade"" with EU states, suggesting the UK could remain within the single market.Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem - who is also president of the eurozone's Eurogroup - said Mr Johnson was putting forward options that ""are really not available"".""He's saying things that are intellectually impossible, politically unavailable, so I think he's not offering the British people a fair view of what is available and what can be achieved in these negotiations,"" he said.EU leaders have continually warned that the UK cannot expect access to European markets after Brexit unless it accepts the free movement of labour.Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU ahead of June's referendum, has criticised those who ""prophesied doom"" over Brexit. He said: ""We are going to get a deal which is of huge value and possibly of greater value.Mr Johnson added: ""We are going to get the best possible deal for trade in goods and services."""

The Bank of England has forecast that unemployment is set to rise amid uncertainty over Brexit.However, the ONS said the latest figures brought the unemployment rate to its lowest level since the three months to September 2005.The total number of people in jobs remained at a record high of 31.8 million, the figures showed.ONS statistician David Freeman said: ""Unemployment is at its lowest for more than 10 years and the employment rate remains at a record high. Nonetheless, there are signs that the labour market might be cooling, with employment growth slowing.""Analysts also noted that the pace of jobs growth was slowing and attributed this to the effects of the UK's vote to leave the EU.""The Leave vote is starting to sap the jobs recovery of its previous strength,"" said Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics.""Employment growth slowed sharply - with the 49,000 rise in the three months to September down from August's 106,000 and well below the consensus forecast of 91,000.""The British Chambers of Commerce said Brexit was ""dampening firms' recruitment intentions"" and that this would put ""increased pressure on UK employment levels"".""These subdued labour market and economic conditions are also expected to keep a lid on wage growth over the next year, despite higher than expected levels of inflation,"" said BCC head of economics Suren Thiru.The BCC called on Chancellor Philip Hammond to include measures in his Autumn Statement next week that would ""support firms looking to recruit and invest in their workforce, including measures to boost investment and lower upfront business costs"".The number of self-employed people increased by 213,000 to 4.79 million - 15.1% of all people in work.Meanwhile, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in October increased by 9,800, the biggest rise since May, the ONS said.The employment figures are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to about 40,000 households once every three months.That is a very large survey, but it still means the figures are not precise.The ONS is 95% confident that the figure of a 37,000 fall in unemployment is accurate give or take 79,000. That means that the fall in unemployment is not statistically significant."

Restrictions on people from the two countries working in the UK were lifted in January 2014.Overall, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU, also including Cyprus, Malta and Croatia, working in the UK was 2.26 million  in July to September. This was up 221,000 compared with the equivalent period last year.The Office for National Statistics said evidence suggested the referendum outcome had had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force. Authoritative data on the flow of foreign workers would not be available until migration figures were published in February, the ONS added."

Mr Gove said executive clemency should be granted to release prisoners who had served far longer than the tariff for their offence and had now - after multiple parole reviews - served even longer than the maximum determinate sentence for that offence.Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Clarke said Mr Gove was the latest in a line of secretaries of state who had pointed out flaws in the system.The prisons inspectorate identified problems with IPP sentences eight years ago, yet little had been done since and progress was ""painfully slow"", Mr Clarke said. He added: ""This should be addressed as a matter of urgency, and it's not just a case of resources - there have been failings and blockages in the prison service, in the probation service and the parole board. ""And we suggest that the only person who's got the authority to get a grip on the way things happen - it may mean policy changes...is the secretary of state [Liz Truss]."" On prison visits, he said inmates - including one who was seven-and-a-half years over his tariff - told him they felt ""trapped in the system"" and unable to prove that they were no longer a risk to the public.One IPP prisoner, James Ward, told the BBC he feared he would never get out. He is in his 11th year in prison after being given a 10-month sentence for arson.Introduced in 2005, the sentences were designed for high-risk criminals responsible for serious violent or sexual offences. If, at the end of their tariff, their danger had not been reduced sufficiently, they would continue to be detained until they had satisfied the Parole Board that they could be managed safely in the community.But the punishments were abolished in 2012 after it emerged they were being used far more widely than intended - and in some instances for low-level crimes.Some 3,200 prisoners have served more than the tariff or minimum sentence they were given, while 400 of them have served at least five times the minimum.Mr Clarke was speaking as HM Inspectorate of Prisons released its report saying ""significant failings"" in the prison, probation and parole systems were contributing to the numbers still in custody years after the end of their tariff. They have been denied the opportunity to demonstrate whether they present a continuing risk to the public, or to have this properly assessed, the study added.Mr Clarke said it was widely accepted that the implementation of the sentence was ""flawed"". He said that while some on IPP sentences remained dangerous, others presented a much lower risk to the public but ""system failures have impeded their progress"". ""The problems with the legacy of the IPP sentence are well understood and there is an openness in government to find new and innovative solutions to the problem,"" he saidJames Ward was given a 10-month IPP for arson in 2006. Now in his 11th year in prison, he still has no release date.He regularly self-harms, sets light to his cell, barricades himself in and has staged dirty protests. With a low IQ, and mental health problems, he cannot cope with prison life.In a letter he wrote to the BBC last week, he said he was struggling inside prison.''I'm hoping they let me out with some support because I'm not getting none in here. ""Hopefully it will happen but I doubt it."" He has a parole board hearing in January, when his solicitor will be arguing for his release. His sister, April Ward, says he has recently cut his wrist. ""We always worry about James,"" she said. ""The biggest fear for my mum and dad is that they will never see James walk free and live a normal, happy life.""She said his prison had given him the job of cleaning out prisoners' cells, which meant wiping blood off the walls where other prisoners had self-harmed. Prisoners asked him to pass drugs between the cells and when he refused, they threw things at him.""He feels like he's been forgotten about, that nobody wants to help him. Nobody wants to take responsibility for the IPP sentence. It's madness,"" she added.Prisoner ‘trapped’ in jail for 10 yearsIn July, the Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick said Ms Truss ""needed to consider"" changing the release test to make it easier for IPP prisoners to be freed. In Wednesday's lecture, Mr Gove called Mr Hardwick ""superb"" and said he should be given the resources and flexibility to ensure more IPP cases could be processed and more individuals released.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Public protection remains our key priority, however this report rightly highlights concerns around the management of IPP prisoners.""That is why we have set up a new unit within the Ministry of Justice to tackle the backlog and are working with the Parole Board to improve the efficiency of the process."""
2016-11-16,Rape law review after Ched Evans case,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-38007467,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe law protecting alleged rape victims from disclosing details of their sex lives will be reviewed in the wake of Wales footballer Ched Evans's case.The Chesterfield striker, 27, was cleared of rape at retrial last month.Accusers do not normally have to disclose sexual history details to defence barristers, but the Court of Appeal said this case was exceptional.Home Office minister Baroness Williams said concerns ""should be looked at and we intend to deal with it"".In 2012, Mr Evans was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, the previous year. He served half of a five-year prison term.That conviction was quashed on appeal in April and he was found not guilty of the same charge at the subsequent retrial after details of the complainant's sexual history were heard in court.Baroness Williams told peers on Tuesday this was only permitted when ""a strict set of criteria are met"".She added: ""We are aware of the recent concern about the admissibility of a complainant's sexual history and wider perceptions about the law.""Lady Justice Hallett ruled Mr Evans's was a ""rare"" case in which it would be appropriate to allow ""forensic examination"" of the woman's sexual behaviour.Mr Evans, a former Wales international who was capped 13 times, always denied having sex with the woman while she was too drunk to consent.He insisted she had agreed to let him ""join in"" while she was having consensual sex with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, 27 - who was cleared of rape at the original trial - after a night out in Rhyl. At Mr Evans's retrial, two other men said the complainant used similar phrases during sex to those the defence said were used when she had sex with Mr Evans and Mr McDonald.Section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 imposes tight restrictions on details of an alleged victims' sexual past being presented in court, other than in exceptional circumstances.Calls for a report into the operation of the legislation were made during the committee stage of the Policing and Crime Bill in the House of Lords.Lord Marks, a Liberal Democrat peer and QC, said: ""The point here and the point that we seek to have reviewed is whether, as a result of the Ched Evans case, there might be cases where the restrictive nature of Section 41 has or may be watered down and we need to look at how its operating. ""It is very important that rape gets reported and it is very important that the legislation in place is certainly as restrictive as we always thought Section 41 was and as the textbooks say it is. ""And the public concern is that this case seems to have weakened that protection."""
2016-11-16,Lord Janner sex abuse hearings 'delayed',https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38000909,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse has delayed hearings into the late Lord Janner.An inquiry official said there was ""significant overlap"" between its investigation and criminal proceedings, which could cause prejudice in court.Lord Janner's family are calling for the ""deeply flawed"" inquiry into him to be dropped. Labour said the whole abuse inquiry was facing a ""crisis of credibility"", but the PM said she had confidence in it.Lord Janner died before a court could examine 22 allegations against him of sex offences against boys between the 1960s and 1980s.Leicestershire Police are still investigating other men, who have also been accused by those who made allegations against Lord Janner.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is also investigating the way the Janner case was dealt with by police.The IICSA had been due to start public hearings on 7 March but officials say these need to be delayed because they might involve alleged victims of Lord Janner who also have to give evidence in other investigations. The IICSA said in a statement that it wanted to ""avoid potential issues around witness overlap"" with police and the IPCC, but was still committed to holding oral hearings. Lord Janner's son, Daniel Janner QC, said the delayed hearings were part of a ""deeply flawed and disgracefully unfair strand"" of the inquiry and they should be dropped. ""The correct place for justice is a court of law and not the inquiry, where proper cross-examination of false allegations is not allowed,"" he added. ""My father has been silenced through death and so any pretence at fairness or justice is a farce.""The IICSA was set up to examine whether public bodies, including the police, had failed in their duty to protect children from sexual abuse and to examine allegations of abuse involving ""well-known people"".The inquiry has suffered a series of setbacks, including resignations of three chairwomen and senior lawyers.On Wednesday, another of the lawyers involved, Aileen McColgan, quit amid concerns about the inquiry's leadership.It is now on its fourth chairwoman after Professor Alexis Jay, who led the Rotherham child abuse inquiry, replaced New Zealand judge Dame Lowell Goddard in August. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Prime Minister Theresa May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd needed to explain to MPs what was going wrong.""The inquiry was established by Theresa May and it clearly isn't working,"" she said.""The victims of child sex abuse have put their faith in this inquiry. The very least they deserve is some openness from government and an explanation for what is going on.""Earlier, Labour's Yvette Cooper said the home affairs select committee, which she chairs, had contacted the lawyers who had left and Lowell Goddard to learn what had gone wrong with the investigation. ""What's unclear is how much this has been about legacy problems - and clearly some personality issues - and whether there have also been structural issues over the last two years, or whether there are ongoing problems for the future,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The inquiry's third chairman, Lowell Goddard, resigned in August. She has instructed lawyers to fight newspaper claims that she had made racist remarks.Professor Jay has also been under criticism from survivors' groups because of her background in social work - a profession they say has failed them.At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mrs May said it was important the inquiry continued and that she had ""full confidence"" in Prof Jay and her ability to lead it.Meanwhile, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has confirmed it is investigating the conduct of five officers linked to the Met's Operation Midland investigation into paedophile allegations against VIPs - which closed in March without a single arrest or charge.  They range from a deputy assistant commissioner to a detective sergeant.   One of them will also be investigated over his involvement in Operation Vicente - which looked into allegations made about the late Sir Leon Brittan. This IPCC investigation is separate from the one looking into the handling of the Lord Janner case. An independent review of Operation Midland by Sir Richard Henriques, released last week, found ""numerous errors"". Operation Midland was launched after claims that boys had been sexually abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies at locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s. It relied heavily on evidence from a complainant known by the pseudonym ""Nick"", who is now being investigated by the Met for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice."
2016-11-16,'Post-truth' declared word of the year,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37995600,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkOxford Dictionaries has declared ""post-truth"" as its 2016 international word of the year, reflecting what it called a ""highly-charged"" political 12 months.It is defined as an adjective relating to circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than emotional appeals. Its selection follows June's Brexit vote and the US presidential election.Oxford Dictionaries' Casper Grathwohl said post-truth could become ""one of the defining words of our time"".Post-truth, which has become associated with the phrase ""post-truth politics"", was chosen ahead of other political terms, including ""Brexiteer"" and ""alt-right"" from a shortlist selected to reflect the social, cultural, political, economic and technological trends and events of the year. Oxford Dictionaries says post-truth is thought to have been first used in 1992.However, it says the frequency of its usage increased by 2,000% in 2016 compared with last year.Mr Grathwohl said: ""Fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment, post-truth as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time,"" he said.""We first saw the frequency really spike this year in June with buzz over the Brexit vote and again in July when Donald Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination. ""Given that usage of the term hasn't shown any signs of slowing down, I wouldn't be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our time.""Dr Claire Hardaker, lecturer in forensic linguistics at Lancaster University, said ""freak moments"" that get people talking were key to the creation of new words. ""When you look back at the dictionary, you get some words that are a spasm of history and they very quickly fall out of use,"" she said. ""They are fashionable, they are trendy and they die. ""Others live on and become part of our language. But it is very unpredictable.""Science fiction author JD Atkin questioned the merit of some recent dictionary additions. He said: ""I'm all for progress, therefore the addition of words such as 'lol' into the dictionary as a reflection of our continually evolving language shouldn't bother me. But it does. ""Lol, for example, is not a word. It is barely splutter. It is an infantile acronym and, I secretly suspect, in most cases a lie. You might smile, you might do that weird snort of air from your nose but I bet you five seconds of human contact that you don't laugh.""Such acronyms, mere spurts of sound, have no business hobnobbing amongst the pages of the dictionary.""Last year, Oxford Dictionaries chose a ""pictograph"" as its word of the year for the first time.It said the ""face with tears of joy emoji"" best represented ""the ethos, mood, and preoccupations of 2015""."
2016-11-16,Voters 'split on UK Brexit priorities',https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37989728,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPeople ""almost universally support"" the UK staying in the EU single market after Brexit - while also wanting new migration controls, research suggests.NatCen Social Research said its study suggested voters did not want a choice between a ""hard"" or ""soft"" Brexit.Asked to pick between ending free movement and continued free trade, opinion was split down the middle.This might leave the government with a ""hard choice"" if EU leaders refuse to budge, a leading pollster said.The government has so far refused to set out its negotiation demands. It plans to begin formal talks with the EU about the UK's exit by the end of March 2017.Downing Street has said it wants the maximum possible access to the single market along with the power to control migration from the EU.But EU leaders have said for the UK to be part of the single market it would have to accept the free movement of people.During the debate about what the government should demand in talks, the terms ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit have been used to describe how close a relationship the UK should aim for in the negotiations.Professor John Curtice, who led the study for research company NatCen, said there appeared to be ""little sign of marked voter hostility"" to things associated with a ""soft Brexit"".90% of respondents support Britain remaining part of the European Union single market 65% of respondents support continuing to follow EU regulations on the design and safety of goods 60% of respondents support allowing boats from the EU to fish in British waters in return for allowing British boats to fish in EU waters But Prof Curtice said these findings were ""insufficient evidence on which to conclude that the public would prefer a soft Brexit to a harder one"".So people were also asked whether they favoured different elements associated with a ""hard"" Brexit, focusing on migration and border checks.They found:Prof Curtice said there was ""relatively little public enthusiasm"" for the principle of free movement of people to continue.""While it may be the case that the EU believes that freedom of movement and free trade go together much like love and marriage were once thought to do, this is evidently not the way in which the average voter in the UK sees the situation,"" he said.In an attempt to determine which issue voters would favour if faced with a choice, people were presented with a scenario that firms could only sell freely in the EU if free movement continued.In response, 49% said the UK ""definitely or probably should agree to freedom of movement if that was necessary to securing continued unfettered access to the EU single market"", while 51% said it ""definitely or probably should not"" - a result that almost matched the balance between Remain and Leave voters in June's referendum.Prof Curtice said given that most Leave voters and Conservative supporters would prioritise migration curbs, the government might favour this option if it came to a choice. NatCen Social Research described its study as the most comprehensive to date on public attitudes towards Brexit.It interviewed 1,391 people between 22 September and 24 October 2016, either online or over the phone, and all respondents were originally interviewed as part of the random probability face-to-face 2015 British Social Attitudes survey."

2016-11-16,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions.

Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-16,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-16,'Lord Farage',https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38001834,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHe has been in the European Parliament since 1999, twice failed to get elected to Westminster, and recently made it to Trump Tower as a guest of the US president-elect.But could the House of Lords be Nigel Farage's next stop?Prime Minister Theresa May declined to rule out the idea when it was put to her during Prime Minister's Questions.This has reignited a debate about whether UKIP's acting leader could soon be sitting on the famous red benches.SNP MP George Kerevan raised the question during PMQs, asking Mrs May whether there had been any ""official conversations"" about giving Mr Farage a peerage.As MPs laughed at the question, the prime minister replied: ""All I can say to him, I'm afraid, is that such matters are normally never discussed in public.""The matter was raised with Mrs May's official spokeswoman after PMQs, who said: ""We don't comment on individuals. There's a process to be followed.""You will have heard the prime minister talk in October about her views on the honours system and making sure that it recognises people who really contribute to society and their communities.""Supporters of the move point to UKIP's record in elections - it comfortably won the 2014 European elections, got the third largest vote share in last year's general election, and achieved its long-held goal of an EU exit in June's referendum.Despite its vote share, UKIP has been left with just one MP and three members of the House of Lords - and these all switched allegiance to the party - compared with the Lib Dems' 104.Supporters say this is unfair and means the party is under-represented.Mr Farage has been promoting his own role recently, offering his services to the government as an intermediary to Mr Trump.However, in July he said his ""political ambition has been achieved"" with the Brexit vote.It's not too surprising that support for Mr Farage's peerage comes from UKIP leadership contenders Paul Nuttall and Suzanne Evans - perhaps more so that former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett also backs his elevation to the Lords.""No matter how deeply we disagree with UKIP's politics, they should also be far better represented in the House of Lords,"" she said last year.Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the BBC he would have put Mr Farage in the Lords after the general election.Although life peers are appointed by the Queen, it is the prime minister who nominates them. The leader of the opposition and other party leaders are also given a set allocation, but UKIP does not, which has long been a bone of contention with Mr Farage's party.One-off announcements can also be made by the government to award peerages to people appointed as ministers who are not MPs."
2016-11-16,In the limelight,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37979406,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAll 11 senior judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom will decide the most significant British constitutional question for years - whether the government has the power to trigger Article 50 of the EU Lisbon Treaty to begin Brexit. It is unprecedented for all 11 Justices to sit for a single case and that is saying a lot for an institution that in one guise or another has existed for more than 600 years.    But, judging so far from the furore greeting the judiciary's involvement in Brexit, it may be a case of safety in numbers.Howls of protest and anger from Brexit-supporting politicians and newspapers greeted the decision by the High Court on 3 November that Parliament must vote on Article 50 before it can be triggered.But the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is highly unlikely to be swayed by such considerations when it starts its deliberations on 5 December.In an exclusive interview with the BBC, one of the judges, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, confessed to feeling unabashed by the predicted public and press interest in the case.""I think that it's not a question of my looking forward to it but I can perfectly well understand why the public is extremely interested in it,"" he told me. ""And that's a good thing. Our communications staff and our reception staff are well prepared to cater for that public interest and to ensure that as much facility for those who are interested in it is provided, so that the public can hear the arguments as they are presented. ""I think that's an entirely healthy thing. So I'm not particularly looking forward to the public interest but I'm certainly not disheartened by it.""The government appealed to the Supreme Court after a ""lower court"", in this case the High Court,  ruled that Parliament must vote before the triggering of Article 50. The High Court had upheld the challenge by businesswoman Gina Miller that Prime Minister Theresa May had no authority by use of the Royal Prerogative to start the process of the UK leaving the EU. Several Brexit-supporting newspapers attacked the decision, with the Daily Mail describing the judges as ""enemies of the people"".Lord Kerr declined to comment about the newspaper headlines but said: ""I think the important message that I would like to convey is that we as judges apply the law. ""We are not involved in reaching decisions based on anything other than the legal principles as they are presented to us and the legal analysis which we conduct as to these extremely difficult and complicated questions. ""That's not to say that we don't have personal views but we are all extremely conscious of the need to set aside our personal views and to apply the law as we conceive it to be.""The Supreme Court is based in Parliament Square next to both Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. The court formally began in October 2009 housed in a building previously used as a crown court. Before 1965 it was home to Middlesex County Council, which was officially abolished in a reorganisation of London's local government.  The Supreme Court took over the functions of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and its justices also sit as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and as such will occasionally hear appeals against the death penalty from Commonwealth countries.More than 100,000 people visit the court each year and more than 350 schools take part in tours and sit in on its many hearings. The building was refurbished to allow a lot of light and colour and houses a café, an exhibition area and even a rather funky carpet designed by Sir Peter Blake, who famously designed the cover for the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper Album. Former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion was commissioned to write a poem, which has been chiselled into stone benches outside the court building. In an average year, the Supreme Court hears around 90 appeals and makes around 80 judgements on important issues of law that shape the way everybody lives, while it also upholds and dismisses appeals in almost equal proportions. On either side of the Atlantic, there is much talk of elites. The Supreme Court is open but not at the moment as diverse or representative as it wishes to be. There is only one woman justice and Oxbridge and public schools feature prominently in the background of most of the justices. Lord Kerr concedes it is a problem, saying, ""Well we're not diverse enough in the sense that we don't reflect the gender balance of the community for a start.""Nor do we reflect the ethnic population of the United Kingdom and that's something that we are concerned about and that we're working towards. ""Curiously enough, I think possibly I represent a particular part of diversity in that I come from Northern Ireland first of all. ""Secondly I wasn't educated in a public school, I didn't go to Oxbridge, and I certainly don't lead a privileged life. ""I was one of a family of seven, of a widowed mother. Happily I was able to go to university but I don't think that I could be described - certainly in terms of background - as coming from an elite."" "
2016-11-16,Exit planning,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37986590,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster does from time to time, there is a frothing row this morning over where a memo - which purports to reveal the government's private Brexit woes and is splashed on the front of The Times - actually comes from.To say that Downing Street is cross is an understatement. They are furious at the story emerging, not just because the claims in it are embarrassing and attack the prime minister's style, but because they say the document was not written by anyone with a real understanding of what's going on, but by a consultant, thought to be from the firm Deloitte, whose analysis was part of a pitch for work.The Times disputes that, saying that senior civil servants were in fact also involved.But whoever is right, the document does matter because it underlines what we have reported and others have written about many times. Five months after the referendum, the cabinet is struggling to agree a common position on what ""Brexit means Brexit"" really means.There is a range of opinion around the table, and a vast amount of work has been commissioned across government to help settle on a view. The Department that's working on the plan, DEXEU, (or Dexit as it's easier to call it if we can get it to catch on) has commissioned 51 different studies of different parts of the economy to 'help'.But as a senior source suggested this week ""they just don't know"" what they are going to do - the ""whole thing is a frightful mess"".Information is piling up, decisions are not. And with a very small majority in the Commons, ministers are worried about losing the arguments and trying to avoid big confrontations.The prime minister's holding position of ""Brexit means Brexit"" is coming under real pressure now.Downing Street was always aware that it couldn't last. But while there is an expectation that the PM might fill in some more of the blanks in a speech at the CBI next week, there is little public sign that the government is actually any closer to any conclusions.Until that changes they will be vulnerable to the charges laid out in the memo, whoever its author, and the charges of ""chaos"" from the opposition."
2016-11-16,Boris Johnson,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37990999,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkForeign Secretary Boris Johnson's praise of Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election came as a surprise to some, given his previous remarks about him. In December 2015, he said Mr Trump was ""out of his mind"" for suggesting a ban on Muslims entering the US. Mr Johnson also attacked the Republican for his claim that police were afraid to patrol parts of London, fearing attacks by religious extremists. The former mayor of London said of Mr Trump's hometown: ""The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.""But as we leap forward to November 2016, and Mr Johnson's words of welcome for a ""positive"" Trump presidency, it's time to take a look back at some of the other occasions Boris Johnson has changed his mind.After the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took legal action against German satirist Jan Boehmermann for performing a poem insulting to the Turkish premier, Boris Johnson wrote a poem of his own. The limerick - the key parts of which we cannot reprint here - won the Spectator magazine's ""President Erdogan Offensive Poetry Competition"" in May.More significantly, though, Mr Johnson has several times changed his public stance on whether or not Turkey should join the EU. During the referendum campaign, he repeatedly warned voters about the prospect of Turkey joining the EU - and the impact migration from the country could have on the UK. That was despite the fact he had previously said keeping Turkey out of the bloc ""sent out the worst possible message to moderates in the Islamic world"". Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told the BBC at the time: ""May God help him and reform him.""Since the referendum, however, Mr Johnson has changed his tone again. In September 2016, he visited Turkey in search of a ""jumbo trade deal"". During the trip, he called for ""a new partnership"" between the UK and Turkey, extolling the virtues of his ""beautiful, very well functioning"" Turkish washing machine. He also said the UK would ""help Turkey in any way"" with its bid to join the EU. The relationship between the outgoing US president and Boris Johnson has had its ups and downs. In 2008, Mr Johnson supported the then US senator's bid to become the first black American president, saying: ""If Barack Obama can do it, it will be the most fantastic boost, I think, for black people everywhere around the world.""This changed when President Obama came out in favour of Britain remaining a member of the EU, and said the UK would be at ""the back of the queue"" to make trade deals with the US if it voted Leave. Reacting in an opinion piece for the Sun in April, Mr Johnson said the ""part-Kenyan President"" suffered from an ""ancestral dislike of the British empire"" that had led him to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office. The comments were branded ""idiotic"" and ""deeply offensive"" by Churchill's grandson, Sir Nicholas Soames.  In a December 2015 column, Mr Johnson wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin was a ""ruthless and manipulative tyrant"" who looked ""a bit like Dobby the House Elf"" from Harry Potter.  But in August, the foreign secretary called for the UK to ""normalise"" relations with Russia. A Foreign Office official said Boris Johnson felt ""we need to continue to build a constructive dialogue on issues of mutual concern as well as on points of disagreement"".Mr Johnson also praised the Russian president for assisting in the liberation of Palmyra in Syria, saying Russian troops had driven the so-called Islamic State group from the archaeologically significant site ""with a ruthless clarity"" that ""made the West look ineffective"".As well as his comments about Barack Obama, Mr Johnson once branded Hillary Clinton a ""sadistic nurse in a mental hospital"".But when he stood alongside Secretary of State John Kerry at a July 2016 press conference, his US counterpart defended him, saying he had been told the foreign secretary was a ""very smart and capable man"".A relieved Mr Johnson said ""Phew - let's stop there."" But a grinning Mr Kerry nudged his less-experienced colleague, saying: ""It's called diplomacy, Boris.""China, 2008: ""Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th Century, and it was called Wiff-waff. And there, I think, you have the difference between us and the rest of the world. Other nations, the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; we looked at it and saw an opportunity to play Wiff-waff. And I say to the Chinese, and to the world, that ping-pong is coming home.""Papua New Guinea, 2006: ""For 10 years, we in the Tory party have become used to Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing, and so it is with a happy amazement that we watch as the madness engulfs the Labour Party.""Uganda, 2002: ""If left to their own devices, the natives would rely on nothing but the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantain."""
2016-11-16,Feeling insecure,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37972087,"Walk the normally staid, greying corridors of EU power in Brussels at the moment and you sense an unaccustomed buzz, a nervousness; there's a whiff of almost frenzied expectation.Change is in the air: exciting and emboldening for some, frightening for others.Imagine the EU in a bowling alley. Well, frankly, its pillars of stability have been falling like ninepins.Brexit, mass migrant arrivals, Russian activity in Ukraine, cross-border Islamist terror (with the Paris attacks anniversary at the weekend), and now the election of Donald Trump as US president, with all the implication that may have for European politics, trade, security and defence.The UK foreign secretary may dismiss it as a ""whinge-o-rama"" and Hungary's government may mutter about ""exaggerated panic"", but EU leaders - and their foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday - have a list of clear-cut concerns about President-elect Trump.More on what Trump means for Europe:Mr Trump's America-first attitude, his comments appearing to question Nato's founding all-for-one-and-one-for-all clause and his apparent admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin have Europeans worried about defence and security, about Syria, about the Iran nuclear deal and about Europe itself. The Russia-fearing Eastern and Baltic countries feel particularly exposed.Yes, Donald Trump's commitment to Nato worries them but they're also apprehensive about changes in political tone towards Russia - not just in the US but here in Europe too.Resurgent anti-establishment, populist parties across the continent - in France, Italy, Austria and beyond - applaud Mr Trump and have established links with Russia.Far-right French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen, well-known for relations with Moscow, said she had accepted an invitation to work with Mr Trump. In Italy, the leader of the nationalist Northern League party told a crowd waving Russian and American flags that he was Italy's Trump.Now Russia-friendly candidates have won elections in Bulgaria and Moldova. And a party close to Moscow is making a power play in Estonia.     EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini is clearly worried.Once again, EU talk of a European Defence Union looms large.It's hardly a new idea - big powers France, Germany, Italy and Spain pushed loudly for it following the UK's Brexit vote in June - but now there's a sense of increased urgency.This is not about building an EU army, insist advocates (though some Europeans are in favour), but rather about sharing defence capabilities and moving towards increased self-reliance in an insecure world.The EU already has its own rapid reaction forces. One argument is that it should deploy them more assertively and effectively.Until now, the UK - one of only two significant military powers in the EU - consistently blocked any moves towards a common EU defence body but it has voted to leave the bloc.Still, to have a European defence union, you need unity amongst EU countries and there's little evidence of that amongst the fractious bunch of 28.When big power Germany hastily convened an EU foreign ministers' dinner in Brussels on Sunday night to discuss Donald Trump's victory, key players Britain and notably France didn't bother showing up.Nato ex-Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen dismisses any talk of the EU going down the defence path alone as ""a paper tiger"".And as much as Ms Mogherini asserts that the EU should be able to defend itself ""with the full potential of a superpower"", the bloc will continue to rely on the US and on Nato in particular.Not that long ago in Europe, mainstream politicians were wondering out loud about whether Nato was an out-dated organisation - hugely important in the shadow of World War Two but less significant in the 21st Century. But increasingly in the face of its multitude of crises - masses of migrants and asylum-seekers braving the Mediterranean to reach Europe, European cities under attack from cross-border Islamist terror and Russia flexing its muscles in the East - the EU has become increasingly reliant on Nato once again.Political memory is short."
2016-11-16,David Harewood,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37799305,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link Take two children born in the UK today - one black and one white. What are the chances of one of them becoming prime minister? The black child is 12 times less likely to make it, according to a BBC documentary presented by David Harewood. The actor, who starred in the TV drama Homeland, reflects on what he found and his own experience of being black and British.We don't like talking about race in the UK - it's a very sensitive subject. People get extremely defensive and run for the covers but I believe we have to talk about it. My parents came over from Barbados in the late 1950s and early 60s. My father was a lorry driver and my mum also worked. The area where I grew up in Birmingham was very diverse - I was aware of my race but not overly aware of it - and there seemed to be an understanding that we were all very much in the same boat.There weren't very many black people on TV then and most of my heroes were American or Caribbean. The West Indian cricket team were probably the most successful black people that I remember seeing. There was always a bit of a carnival in my house whenever they came over and beat England. That was our one chance to culturally celebrate some kind of black success. I was lucky to get into drama school and become a professional actor. No-one ever mentioned the colour of my skin. It's only when I came out of RADA - the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art - that I suddenly realised people started to refer to me as a black actor. Initially I found work very easily and then I just sort of fell off a cliff. There are lots of roles for young black men but very few roles for leading black men in the UK. No-one's writing those roles, no-one's commissioning those dramas as they are in America. I've spent the past five or six years in America where I can play leading, authoritative characters - such as the head of the CIA in Homeland. I've got used to turning on my TV and seeing black generals, sheriffs, chiefs of police, politicians, financial experts, political experts and news anchors. I'm used to seeing black people getting into that executive level and I realised that I still don't see that in the UK.  I'm 51 years old this year, and coming back to the UK to make this programme, I would have thought that things would have got better, I presumed that black people would by now have gone on to university and got into the private sector, the boardrooms and managerial roles. But when I looked at the data is was very sobering. It took the wind out of my sails.Will Britain Ever Have A Black Prime Minister? was made for BBC Two as part of the Black and British season - watch the documentary and read more about the research. As many as 45% of all black children here are growing up in poverty compared to 25% of white children, according to government statistics. That has an impact on their early development - by the time they start school, the vocabulary of the poorest children lags more than a year behind that of wealthy children. White pupils are more likely to get three As at A level, and a state-educated black boy is more likely to be excluded from school than get three As. While we were making the programme, I met Aisha who is a very optimistic, spirited young black girl from south London. She's part of a generation that is aspirational, looking forward, wanting to better themselves. I think that's very inspiring. Aisha is hoping to go to Oxford University, and as far as she's concerned, it's a case of getting the grades, applying and being accepted.But we found evidence that black students were less likely to be offered places at top universities than white students who have the same predicted grades - that's according to research by Dr Vikki Boliver at Durham University.People who have overcome difficult backgrounds and all the obstacles of the inner-city world and attained the grades should be viewed as tenacious, strong and determined. But Boliver thinks there could be an ""unconscious bias"" in the admissions process. Whether you want to call it unconscious bias or institutional racism, let's all acknowledge there's a problem and make it better. Being defensive on this issue is getting us nowhere. It's deeply frustrating and slightly annoying to me as to why we're finding it so difficult to reach those higher echelons. We still don't have any black judges in the Supreme Court or High Court, or generals in the British army, for example.  We're still not taking charge. It's partly down to the education system and partly because we have to filter ourselves through this very British system. I was surprised at that. I do think we need to have some kind of radical change, perhaps legislatively, because I don't think it's happening of its own volition fast enough. I'm not sure we've discussed how to do that in terms of politics and business and society. I've got two daughters and hope that they will go on to have bright futures and be able to access that higher level. As far as a black prime minister goes and who it would be, I think it'll happen very suddenly. Somebody will be on the ballot and everybody will go: ""This guy ticks all the boxes."" But first of all we have to get more black people into politics - only 2% of our MPs are black, while black people make up 4% of the wider population. Hopefully a voice will emerge that puts everybody at ease and makes everybody excited, just like Barack Obama did in the US. Maybe in the next 10 years somebody will come up who has that fire, who is unafraid, who is articulate, who can stand up and be the one.

2016-11-16,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161117014103/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-17,MPs call for 50% cut to air travel tax,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38014907,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkMPs are urging the government to halve air passenger duty in next week's Autumn Statement, saying the tax hampers post-Brexit Britain's ability to trade outside Europe.The British Infrastructure Group (BIG) claims the tax acts directly against a policy of extending UK business links to the ""farthest reaches of the globe"".The tax is set to rise again in April to £150 for some long-haul flights.Opponents accused the aviation industry of wanting a ""free ride"" on air taxes.In its report, BIG said air passenger duty (APD) should be cut by 50%, then scrapped altogether.Grant Shapps, the former international development minister who leads BIG, said Prime Minister Theresa May needs to make good on a promise she gave on Monday to ""forge a bold, new, confident future for ourselves in the world"".He said: ""Particularly post-Brexit, now is the time to do it."" He added that reducing APD could provide an immediate ""Brexit dividend"" because the government would not have to wait until Article 50 is triggered to make the cut.Britain has one of the highest air travel taxes in the world. On economy class flights of over 2,000 miles, passengers pay £73 in tax, which will rise to £75 next year. On long-haul business class journeys, flyers currently pay £146 in duty which will increase to £150 in April.   In the report, BIG cites industry figures that show UK APD for non-economy tickets is three times more expensive than France and four times higher than Germany. It notes that Ireland has scrapped APD completely. Also, Scotland is planning to reduce APD by 50% in 2018. ""APD has disproportionate effects on different tickets, disadvantaging flights to the Far East and especially to developing economies, where the cost of a plane ticket from London can be well over 10% tax,"" the report said.""If the government is to act on its commitments, especially those of securing new trading partners outside the EU, it must make it as easy as possible to do business, conduct negotiations and to stimulate the exchange of people and skills.""It cannot continue to actively make extra-European travel more expensive than it needs to be.""Some MPs will strongly resist any attempt to cut aviation taxes.  Earlier this week, the Environmental Audit Committee said the Treasury must consider the environmental impacts of its decisions.They are likely to point out that the biggest beneficiaries of a duty cut would be long-haul holiday makers, who might otherwise be spending their money in the UK.  Business passenger numbers are stagnant - the growth in demand is for holidays.They will mention that aviation is already uniquely protected from efforts to cut carbon emissions: under the government's plans, emissions from motoring and home heating will have to be cut to accommodate the growth in carbon dioxide from aviation. Critics are also likely to say that families travelling by air pay less tax per mile than car drivers, even though driving a family on holiday causes less pollution than going by plane.They will also question whether £150 tax will really deter a company director who has forked out for a business class seat.While the former Chancellor George Osborne exempted children under 16 from APD, the tax has continued to rise for adults.When it was introduced in 1994, the charge was £5 on short-haul flights and £10 on long-haul travel and was expected to generate £330m a year in revenue. APD now generates around an annual £3bn for the government. Mr Shapps argued a sharp drop in tax revenue from implementing a 50% cut would be recovered from increased trade outside Europe. He added that a reduction would allow Philip Hammond to ""stamp his own authority"" as chancellor in his first Autumn Statement next Wednesday since being appointed to the role. However, Mary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said: ""Transport is the highest emitting sector of the UK economy and there are already problems with the UK meeting our fourth carbon budget which starts in six years. ""We recommend that the chancellor green check all Autumn Statement decisions, especially any change to air passenger duty which could increase airport congestion and air pollution.""John Stewart, from pressure group HACAN, said that every year before the Autumn Statement, calls are ""trotted out"" for an end of APD.  ""Every year key facts are glossed over. For the vast majority of passengers it adds just £13 to a ticket, less than the cost of  breakfast at an airport terminal.  ""The aviation industry enjoys tax-free fuel.  If its fuel was taxed at the same rate as petrol for cars, airlines would end up paying much more than they do through APD.""Labour's environment spokesman Barry Gardiner MP said: ""Aviation needs to follow the polluter pays principle.""BIG are being disingenuous in claiming reduced tax is necessary for trade: any business committed to exporting to China isn't going to measure the cost/benefit in terms of £150 air passenger duty"".A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We keep all taxes under review, and do not comment on speculation around the Autumn Statement."""
2016-11-17,Chancellor 'still aspires for surplus',https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38017223,"Philip Hammond is expected say in his Autumn Statement he will still aim to achieve a budget surplus, despite abandoning a formal target by George Osborne to do so by 2020.The chancellor's friend, MP Stephen Hammond, said Mr Hammond planned to set out an ""intellectual framework"" to bring the economy back to surplus.But this would not be achieved until the economy has been stabilised after the uncertainty of the Brexit vote.The Autumn Statement is on Wednesday.Stephen Hammond said the chancellor would use his more flexible approach to allow for some extra spending on infrastructure. But this will be targeted to ensure it produces a return.Stephen Hammond added that he expected the chancellor to deliver a ""steady-as-she-goes"" Autumn Statement with no rabbits out of the hat in the style of his predecessor and Gordon Brown. The chancellor wants the Autumn Statement to return to its original purpose as the lower profile of the two ""fiscal events"" of the year with major tax changes left to the budget in the spring.The Treasury prompted speculation over the summer that it would adopt a looser fiscal policy - covering tax and spending - when the chancellor formally endorsed one of Theresa May's main pledges in the brief Conservative leadership contest. This was to abandon George Osborne's target of achieving an overall budget surplus by the time of the next election in 2020. This would mean that public spending would no longer outstrip incoming revenue.In his BBC Newsnight interview, Stephen Hammond said the chancellor will make clear in his Autumn Statement that he is still committed to achieving fiscal discipline and to achieving a surplus. But he will avoid setting a specific target date.The former transport minister, who has known his namesake for 25 years but is unrelated to the chancellor, told Newsnight: ""I think the Autumn Statement will see him reacting to the events, suggesting that some of the tight targets set out by George which looked feasible at the time, to be fair, now must be more uncertain because of the progress of the economy.""But intellectually the framework remains the same - that we intend to achieve a fiscal surplus within the life of the next parliament.""Stephen Hammond said that the chancellor believes it is right to adopt a more flexible approach to give the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility time to assess the extent of the impact of the economy EU referendum. He said: ""We live in very uncertain economic times. The fact that two or three months of relatively good economic news has come through does not mean by any means this economy is going have an easy ride after Brexit. ""So I think his statement about looking at the surplus targets and softening slightly them reflects that there is still quite a lot of uncertainty about the progress of the economy. ""But underlying that you will see Philip put in place fiscal disciplines that do ensure the economy comes back to surplus.""The chancellor is also expected to make clear next week that he sanctions a mild loosening of the purse strings to allow for infrastructure spending which could include so-called infrastructure bonds. But this will be within a strict fiscal framework.Stephen Hammond said: ""Anyone who thinks Philip Hammond is going to be Keynes has probably misunderstood his economic philosophy. ""But what it will be is accepting that there are things the government can and should do to ensure the economy continues to prosper in difficult times. ""Some of that is slowing down a little bit on fiscal discipline.  But it means ensuring that the progress to budget surplus is still there. ""Some of it is ensuring that the projects you spend are there and can generate jobs but there is value for money and its proven business case.""The Autumn Statement will mark a departure from the approach taken by George Osborne in another key area - the chancellor will adopt a steady-as-she-goes approach. There may be some modest measures, possibly a freeze in fuel duty and measures to encourage saving, aimed at the key group of voters identified by Downing Street - the so-called Just About Managing people (JAMs). But major tax changes will have to wait until the Budget.Nicholas Watt is political editor for BBC Newsnight - more on this story on the programme at 22:30 GMT on BBC Two"
2016-11-17,£8bn NHS budget plan 'not enough',https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38019771,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPatients in England will see rising waiting times, rationing and cuts in the number of staff unless the NHS gets more money, health bosses say.A five-year plan to increase the budget by £8bn a year by 2020 was only set out last year, but now hospital bosses have warned that is not enough.Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, said the settlement needed to be redrawn.It comes as the half-year accounts for 2016-17 showed hospitals and other NHS trusts were failing to keep in budget.From April to September trusts overspent by £648m - this is despite hospitals being given an extra £1.8bn this year to bail them out following last year's record deficit of £2.45bn.Mr Hopson's comments plus the emerging deficit puts the pressure on ministers ahead of the Autumn Statement next Wednesday.This will be the first time the government under Theresa May's leadership has outlined its spending priorities. All the indications to date are that ministers are not prepared to give the NHS more money, although there have been rumours that council-run care services could see investment to help reduce demands on the health service.Mr Hopson criticised the way the current spending plans had been structured.He pointed out the rise in spending was actually £4.5bn rather than £8bn when cuts to other budgets, including those for training staff and money for public health schemes such as stop smoking services, was taken into account.He also said the extra demands being placed on hospitals, GPs and council-run care services had been underestimated, while the target to save £22bn in efficiencies by 2020 was ""too ambitious"".""For all these reasons, there is now a clear and widening gap between what is being asked of the NHS and the funding available to deliver it,"" Mr Hopson said. ""We are therefore asking for a new plan for the rest of the parliament to finalise or confirm the NHS budget and honestly and realistically set out what can be delivered. ""If there are no changes to the money available we will need to set out what the NHS stops doing. Right now the service cannot deliver what is being asked of it on the current budget.""He said that could include longer waiting times, rationing of non-emergency care such as knee and hip replacements and fewer doctors and nurses.Targets are already being missed in A&E and cancer care, while the waiting list for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, has hit 3.7m up from 3m two years ago.But instead of prioritising hospitals, he said any extra money should be invested in GPs and council care services to try to stem the rising demands. He refused to say how much more the health service needed however.Meanwhile, the campaign group Equality 4 Mental Health, headed by Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb and Conservative Andrew Mitchell, called for more to be done to make sure extra money got through to mental health.The group - with the backing of nine former health secretaries - has said services are still being squeezed despite promises for care to be prioritised.Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, agreed there need to be a rethink on finances, saying a ""long-term solution"" was needed rather than the ""sticking plaster"" of the current plans. But the Department of Health defended its record. ""The government has taken tough economic decisions that have allowed us to invest in our NHS, which is meeting record patient demand while improving standards of care.""

That expired with no objections raised by the House of Commons or Lords.The long-standing climate change sceptic MP Peter Lilley told BBC News that he did not object to the Paris Agreement in Parliament because he didn't notice it.He said: ""If I had noticed it, I might have made an attempt to draw together a group of people to object to it. I suspect we would have had more names than last time (the Climate Change Act was passed with five objections) - but it probably would have been a rather ineffective gesture.""More than 100 countries have already officially signed up to the deal, which came into force earlier this month.Barry Gardiner, shadow minister for international climate change, said: ""This strong signal of the UK's commitment to international co-operation on climate change is even more important following the US election.""The UK Government must now show their commitment through climate action on the ground.""We face a 47% shortfall to meet our 2030 climate target.""The climate minister Nick Hurd said: ""The UK is ratifying the Paris Agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all. ""We are going to use this positive momentum to grow the UK low-carbon sector, which is already worth over £46bn, as we continue to provide secure, affordable and clean energy to our families and businesses.""Some 20,000 participants are currently attending UN climate talks in Marrakech, Morocco, where negotiators will be discussing the agreement's detail.Follow Roger on Twitter."
2016-11-17,Plans to curb Lords powers dropped,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38008315,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has decided against a new law to curb the powers of the House of Lords to block legislation.Former House of Lords leader Lord Strathclyde came up with a proposal to remove peers' veto over laws - called statutory instruments - after a series of government defeats last year.The government said it now had ""no plans"" for legislation on the issue.But it warned peers it could reconsider unless they showed ""discipline and self regulation"".The government announced its review into the workings of Parliament last year after defeats in the House of Lords over controversial tax credit cuts. Labour said the original plan had been an ""absurd overreaction"".In a statement to peers, Baroness Evans, the leader of the House of Lords, said the will of elected MPs should prevail where there was a clash between the House of Commons and the House of Lords over a statutory instrument.But she added: ""We do not believe that we need to introduce primary legislation at this time.""Unlike with regular legislation, there is not currently a mechanism to assert the Commons' primacy on statutory instruments, so the government relies on the ""discipline and self regulation that this House imposes on itself"", she said.""Should that break down we would have to reflect on this decision.""There have been claims the Lords could delay or block Brexit legislation, and Baroness Evans said when such laws are debated, ""the constructive approach that this House has so far shown will be ever more important"".There are several reasons why the Strathclyde proposals are now never likely to see the light of day.First, as if it needs saying, the political circumstances are transformed from this time last year. The government is trying not to fall into a black hole of Brexit, so some of the priorities of the previous administration that might have caused trouble in Parliament are being ditched.Second, Theresa May is a pragmatist. These plans were deeply controversial, described as the Labour Lords leader as an ""absurd overreaction"", and themselves might have struggled to get through Parliament.And third, sources have suggested that the government seems to want to rebuild a more traditional relationship with the Lords, dial down the confrontations and work more constructively together.Read more from LauraThe change of heart is another policy planned by former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne that Theresa May's government is abandoning. One source said the reform had now ""been dumped"". Another added: ""The world has changed.""It has been suggested to the BBC that the change is part of No 10 distancing itself from the previous administration, and part of its desire to pare back any legislation that might be controversial as the government prepares to face resistance in Parliament over its plans for leaving the EU. Lord Strathclyde told the BBC it would be sensible if the government could find a way of working more effectively with opposition parties in the Lords without having to change the law, saying:  ""Legislation should be a last resort.""Baroness Smith, Labour's leader in the Lords, said she welcomed the government's realisation that ""the Strathclyde review was an absurd overreaction to a sensible and principled challenge on tax credits"".Crossbench peer Lord Digby Jones said the move was a ""big mistake"" and risked peers blocking Brexit.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would have stuck to my guns because I think they're going to live to regret it on all of the Brexit stuff coming down the pipe.""But the Electoral Reform Society described the Strathclyde proposals as a ""knee-jerk reaction to a government defeat"", calling instead for ""genuine Lords reform""."
2016-11-17,Jo Cox witness told of 'hell' in 999 call,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38012499,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA witness dialled 999 after MP Jo Cox was attacked, saying: ""There's hell on, it's chaos"", the Old Bailey has heard.Jurors were played a recording of the call by Darren Playford, who said: ""He's stabbed and shot people.""They also heard from witnesses who described a man grabbing the Labour MP's hair, before stabbing and shooting her and shouting about Britain.Mrs Cox, 41, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June. Thomas Mair, 53, denies her murder.Mr Mair, from Birstall, also denies grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger.Mrs Cox, a Remain campaigner, and her staff were due at a constituency surgery at Birstall library before joining an EU campaign stall later that afternoon - a week before the EU referendum.In the 999 call played to the jury, Mr Playford said: ""He's shooting everyone.""The operator said: ""Who's shooting everyone?""He replied: ""The gunman. Outside the library in Birstall.""He said the man had ""stabbed a lady"", adding: ""He's following me at the moment. I'm just trying to get away from him. If you sent the helicopter up he's walking towards Huddersfield Road.""Mr Playford then kept talking to the operator and kept them informed about the man going behind the Vaults pub and changing his clothes.He said: ""If you hurry up you'll get him. There's hell on. It's chaos, he's stabbed and shot people.""Earlier, David Honeybell described how he saw the attack on his way to Mrs Cox's surgery.He told the jury he was at the library to see Mrs Cox at her surgery when he saw a man with a knife, and a woman lying on the road.""He just stood over her, cocked his gun and blasted her,"" he said. ""Walked away like he didn't have a care in the world.""Taxi driver Rashid Hussain told the court he saw a man stab Mrs Cox five or six times.He said he confronted the man near Birstall library after he heard screaming and shouting, saw him shoot at Mrs Cox and heard him shout ""Britain First"".Mr Hussain said: ""He said, 'Move back or I'll stab you.'""I saw an Asian lady screaming, saying 'Jo'. She was the only person helping her. Jo's head was in her lap.""He shot once then moved back and shot again. He was shooting behind the car where Jo was laid. He shouted Britain First.""Another witness, Clarke Rothwell, said he saw a man shoot a woman who was lying on the pavement outside Birstall library.He said he heard the man say words like ""This is for Britain"".Tracy Bywood said she was working at the Priestley Care Home when she saw a man beating a woman.""I saw him wind his hand in her hair and drag her off the pavement,"" she said.""It was horrible what I saw. She went down on the floor like a sack of potatoes. It was awful to see a lady get such animosity.""She said she was ""fairly sure"" she heard ""someone shout Britain First"".""He was so peaceful and calm as if he hadn't done anything wrong,"" she said.She told the jury she heard a ""popping noise"" and said: ""I won't even buy Pringles any more, I can't handle the noise of the seal breaking.""Michaela Noble, a cook at the Priestley Care Home, said she could see a man dragging a woman off the kerb by her hair.She said he was kicking her before he stabbed her several times.Another witness, Julie Holmes, said she was working at her shop when she heard a loud popping sound from Market Street and raised voices.She said she saw a man strike a woman, who fell down, and saw him stab the woman all over her body and around her head and neck.The trial continues.Jo Cox was a self-proclaimed ""proud Yorkshire lass"" whose work for charity took her around the world and whose political success led her to Westminster.The 41-year-old mother-of-two was elected as MP for Batley and Spen in the 2015 election and increased Labour's majority to 6,051 (from 4,406 in the 2010 election).She described herself as ""proud and humbled"" to be the Labour MP for the place where she was born.Mrs Cox first worked in politics after graduating from Cambridge University in 1995, but then built a career working for charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the NSPCC.She was described by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as ""a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for justice and peace.""Tireless campaigner turned political 'star'"
2016-11-17,UKIP grouping denies misspending EU funds,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38016829,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA European Parliament group dominated by UKIP MEPs has denied claims it misspent EU funds on UK campaigns.An audit leaked to Sky News said the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe broke rules because the funding must be spent on European Parliament business.An ADDE spokesman accused the European Parliament of ""harassment"" over the audit and said most of the funds spent had been ""fully eligible"". UKIP's Roger Helmer told the BBC: ""Call it revenge for Brexit if you like"".BBC correspondent Damian Grammaticas said the leaked audit said that more than 500,615 euros (£430,486) had been misspent - much of it in the UK ahead of parliamentary elections in UKIP target seats including Thanet South, where leader Nigel Farage stood. The leaked audit accuses the ADDE of spending EU money intended to be spent on European Parliament business on polling in constituencies UKIP targeted in the 2015 general election, and on UKIP's Leave campaign during the EU Referendum.The findings will go to the European Parliament Bureau, which is responsible for budget matters, next week. If they are upheld, the ADDE could be asked to repay more than 170,000 euros (£146,185).UKIP set up the ADDE in 2014 - it has 27 MEPs from seven countries, the largest group of which are UKIP MEPs. One of them, UKIP MEP for the East Midlands, Mr Helmer likened the actions of the European Parliament authorities to a witch-hunt: ""They are absolutely determined to close down Eurosceptic groups. It isn't just our group it's other Eurosceptic groups in the parliament. They have been planning it for a long time.""He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme trying to repay £146,185 would ""place us in a difficult position"" adding: ""which is exactly what the Parliamentary administration is seeking to do"". A spokesman for the ADDE said: ""The parliament administration has for months taken an aggressive and hostile attitude over the audit, amounting to nothing short of deliberate harassment. This is a blatant deviation to its requested neutrality.""He added: ""It has become increasingly apparent since Brexit that anything short of 'group think' is no longer tolerated within the European Union. Any deviation will see the rules changed and goalposts moved.""Everything the ADDE has conducted is to provide a more coherent overview of the opinions expressed by the population that is represented by the members of the ADDE.""We are therefore confident that our expenditures - with the exception of a few minor items - are fully eligible and compliant to EU regulations. They are also in line with fully accepted activities from other groups. We will be taking this matter to the European Court of Justice."" "

2016-11-17,Retail sales soar on colder weather,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38011477,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUK retail sales rose at their fastest annual rate in 14 years in October, bolstered by colder weather and Halloween sales at supermarkets. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said sales volumes in October were up 7.4% from a year earlier.On a monthly basis, sales jumped 1.9% from September - a much stronger increase than economists had forecast.October's autumnal conditions boosted clothing sales.Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Clothing sales in particular were strong, perhaps reflecting the cooler weather prompting a re-stocking of consumers' winter wardrobes.""The ONS also said that internet sales posted the strongest growth for five years, jumping almost 27%.""Non-store sales have surged over the last months, rising by 4.1% in September and 3.6% in October, showing no weakening in the trend away from spending on the high street to online shopping,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.The figures suggest consumer confidence remains robust in the face of uncertainty caused by Brexit. The pound jumped 0.3% to $1.2478 following the data, but fell against the euro.Stronger sales were helped by falling prices. Average store prices fell by 0.7% in October 2016 compared with October 2015 and there were falls in average store price across all store types, except petrol stations, the ONS said.However, analysts said that the era of falling prices was set to end soon at a time of weak wage growth.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, commented: ""UK retailers enjoyed a mini-boom in October. But such spending is looking increasingly unsustainable as inflation is likely to rear its head in coming months and households are growing worried about their future finances.""Mr Tombs said retail sales growth was likely to disappoint in November as clothing sales returned to normal levels."
2016-11-17,Labour MP Lewis makes climate change call,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38018143,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe UK should be showing international leadership on tackling climate change following Donald Trump's US victory, Labour frontbencher Clive Lewis says.In a speech in London, he said ""there is a real danger that, without urgent action, the election of Donald Trump could mean 'game over' for our planet"".He said a Labour government would ensure 60% of UK energy came from low carbon or renewable sources by 2030.Mr Trump has said he wants the US to leave the Paris Agreement on climate. The US president-elect has said the deal is ""bad for US business"" and will allow ""foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use"" and has expressed scepticism about the science behind climate change.Mr Lewis's speech came as the UK signed a document ratifying the Paris agreement - the world's first comprehensive agreement on tackling climate change.The shadow business secretary said that while the government had signed the deal, it had ""failed comprehensively on showing a lead on climate change"". Mr Lewis told the BBC: ""In terms of their record on renewables it's been absolutely appalling, their record on solar, the thousands of job losses, cuts to the various subsidies ... this is a nascent sector, it's a growing sector - or it was a growing sector - and they've pulled the rug away from it.""During his speech he said it was now ""time for Britain to show leadership on one of the biggest challenges confronting humanity today - climate change"".He said Labour aimed to develop a ""mission-orientated industrial strategy"" rather than ""picking winners, or pouring good money after bad into white elephants"".""Instead we'll set the missions - put in place the right institutional framework and support - and then let business figure out how to get there. We'll initiate and direct a wave of innovation across a range of industries.""So today, I'm pleased to announce the first of these missions; the next Labour government will ensure 60% of our energy comes from low carbon or renewable sources by 2030.""Later he told the BBC that there was ""potentially a danger"" over climate change once Mr Trump becomes US president: ""He said quite clearly before the election he's a climate change sceptic.  ""America is a leading partner in international climate change agreements... this will struggle to work if America isn't part of it.""I think it's incumbent on our government, this country, to show real international leadership when it comes to Paris, when it comes to climate change, when it comes to supporting renewables.  ""Not just because it's essential for climate change but because it's also a fantastic business opportunity for businesses in our economy to get ahead, to innovate, to become net exporters of technology around clean and efficient energy.""The National Grid has said the UK is likely to miss its EU 2020 target to produce 15% of total energy from renewables. While it said Britain's progress on wind and solar-powered electricity has been quicker than some people expected, the rate of progress towards electric and hydrogen cars needs to almost treble (from 15 terrawatt hours (TWh) to 40TWh) to meet the target.

2016-11-17,Action urged over 'unjust' prison terms,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38006287,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkJustice Secretary Liz Truss must ""get a grip"" on the backlog of inmates being held beyond their sentence, the chief inspector of prisons has said.Peter Clarke said it was ""completely unjust"" that offenders serving Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) terms were ""languishing in jail"".He warned that IPP sentences, abolished in 2012, were having a serious effect on prisoners' mental health.The Ministry of Justice said a new unit had been set up to tackle the problem.More than 3,800 prisoners in England and Wales are serving indeterminate IPP sentences, designed to protect the public.Of those, 500 should be let go, former Justice Secretary Michael Gove said, when he delivered the annual Longford lecture in memory of prison reformer Lord Longford. Mr Gove said executive clemency should be granted to release prisoners who had served far longer than the tariff for their offence and had now - after multiple parole reviews - served even longer than the maximum determinate sentence for that offence.Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Clarke said Mr Gove was the latest in a line of secretaries of state who had pointed out flaws in the system.The prisons inspectorate identified problems with IPP sentences eight years ago, yet little had been done since and progress was ""painfully slow"", Mr Clarke said. He added: ""This should be addressed as a matter of urgency, and it's not just a case of resources - there have been failings and blockages in the prison service, in the probation service and the parole board. ""And we suggest that the only person who's got the authority to get a grip on the way things happen - it may mean policy changes...is the secretary of state [Liz Truss]."" On prison visits, he said inmates - including one who was seven-and-a-half years over his tariff - told him they felt ""trapped in the system"" and unable to prove that they were no longer a risk to the public.One IPP prisoner, James Ward, told the BBC he feared he would never get out. He is in his 11th year in prison after being given a 10-month sentence for arson.Introduced in 2005, the sentences were designed for high-risk criminals responsible for serious violent or sexual offences. If, at the end of their tariff, their danger had not been reduced sufficiently, they would continue to be detained until they had satisfied the Parole Board that they could be managed safely in the community.But the punishments were abolished in 2012 after it emerged they were being used far more widely than intended - and in some instances for low-level crimes.Some 3,200 prisoners have served more than the tariff or minimum sentence they were given, while 400 of them have served at least five times the minimum.Mr Clarke was speaking as HM Inspectorate of Prisons released its report saying ""significant failings"" in the prison, probation and parole systems were contributing to the numbers still in custody years after the end of their tariff. They have been denied the opportunity to demonstrate whether they present a continuing risk to the public, or to have this properly assessed, the study added.Mr Clarke said it was widely accepted that the implementation of the sentence was ""flawed"". He said that while some on IPP sentences remained dangerous, others presented a much lower risk to the public but ""system failures have impeded their progress"". ""The problems with the legacy of the IPP sentence are well understood and there is an openness in government to find new and innovative solutions to the problem,"" he saidJames Ward was given a 10-month IPP for arson in 2006. Now in his 11th year in prison, he still has no release date.He regularly self-harms, sets light to his cell, barricades himself in and has staged dirty protests. With a low IQ, and mental health problems, he cannot cope with prison life.In a letter he wrote to the BBC last week, he said he was struggling inside prison.''I'm hoping they let me out with some support because I'm not getting none in here. ""Hopefully it will happen but I doubt it."" He has a parole board hearing in January, when his solicitor will be arguing for his release. His sister, April Ward, says he has recently cut his wrist. ""We always worry about James,"" she said. ""The biggest fear for my mum and dad is that they will never see James walk free and live a normal, happy life.""She said his prison had given him the job of cleaning out prisoners' cells, which meant wiping blood off the walls where other prisoners had self-harmed. Prisoners asked him to pass drugs between the cells and when he refused, they threw things at him.""He feels like he's been forgotten about, that nobody wants to help him. Nobody wants to take responsibility for the IPP sentence. It's madness,"" she added.Prisoner ‘trapped’ in jail for 10 yearsIn July, the Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick said Ms Truss ""needed to consider"" changing the release test to make it easier for IPP prisoners to be freed. In Wednesday's lecture, Mr Gove called Mr Hardwick ""superb"" and said he should be given the resources and flexibility to ensure more IPP cases could be processed and more individuals released.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Public protection remains our key priority, however this report rightly highlights concerns around the management of IPP prisoners.""That is why we have set up a new unit within the Ministry of Justice to tackle the backlog and are working with the Parole Board to improve the efficiency of the process."""
2016-11-17,Hain: Talk to Islamic State periphery,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-38014882,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNegotiations are needed with the ""periphery"" of so-called Islamic State (IS) to isolate the ""hardcore"" terrorists, a former Northern Ireland secretary has said.Lord Hain claimed the hardliners would be very difficult to engage with, as they lacked a ""negotiating objective"".  The comments came in a lecture at the University of South Wales in Treforest. The Foreign Office said it would not consider dialogue with a ""barbaric"" terrorist group intent on destruction.The Labour peer - who was also Welsh Secretary - drew parallels with Northern Ireland, saying IS's call to arms resonated with Sunni Muslims persecuted in Iraq in the same way that the IRA had tacit support from ""otherwise peaceful Catholics"".He added that, as with the IRA, it could be possible to negotiate with people on the periphery of IS rather than the hardliners.Speaking to BBC Wales following the lecture on Thursday, Lord Hain said: ""IS have got to be defeated militarily otherwise they will run amok. The only way to stop them is by military action.""But we have got to create a political environment through political negotiation, especially with Sunni Muslims who see IS as a protective vehicle against Shia Muslims, the West, President Assad, or sectarian Shia rule in Iraq.""We have got to be able to engage and negotiate with the periphery of IS,"" Lord Hain said. ""The hardliners inside [the group] will be very difficult to negotiate with because they do not have a negotiating objective the way the IRA did on Northern Ireland.""We have got to peel away that periphery of support from IS that feeds off grievances ... and isolate the IS hardcore.""Asked if the IS ""periphery"" would be receptive to talks, Lord Hain said: ""There would be a receptiveness if Britain, the US and Europe were actually saying this clearly, and that means taking on some of our allies in the region who are acting malevolently, particularly Saudi Arabia and Turkey. ""Lord Hain, who referred to IS in his lecture as a ""ruthlessly potent threat"", also spoke of his wish for Arab states to take ""ownership"" of conflicts in the Middle East.""Otherwise Western states run the risk of minimising the threat of IS against Arabic states, thus minimising those states' responsibility to act,"" he said.He praised the UK's role in air strikes against IS in Iraq, but warned that troops on the ground would be ""entirely counterproductive"".Western intervention in Iraq against Saddam Hussein in 2003 was a ""salutary case"" of where things could go disastrously wrong, Lord Hain added. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are disgusted by the brutality and inhumanity of Daesh [Islamic State] in the Middle East and the resulting humanitarian crisis. ""We know that we are up against a barbaric terrorist group that is intent on destruction, not dialogue. ""In these circumstances the government would not consider any proposal to enter into a dialogue with an organisation of this kind.""Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called Mr Hain's negotiation suggestion ""irresponsible"" and ""naive""."

2016-11-17,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

While recent data has shown a robust economy, a slowdown in growth is being forecast for next year.Uncertainty over Brexit has weakened the pound, which has been great for exporters but has made imported goods and raw materials more expensive.The BBC has been speaking to businesses from across the UK, finding out how their bosses are feeling and what they would like to see from the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, 23 November.In Scunthorpe Shay Eddy, the managing director of SC4 Steel which supplies the construction industry, is feeling optimistic.""We're certainly in a better position than we were 12 months ago.""We invested at the bottom of the cycle, we ordered a new machine that's just been commissioned now. We've just committed to another machine and we're looking at expanding and exporting starting January next year.""But like other businesses, he wants to know more about the UK's future relationship with Europe.""More clarity would be ideal because uncertainty is no good for anybody, but we can't expect the government to tip their hand as to what they are going to be negotiating with,"" he says.Norbar Torque Tools, based in Banbury, is one of Oxfordshire's best known exporters. As 35% of its sales go to mainland Europe the firm is closely watching the Brexit debate.""The single most important thing for exporting companies like us is that the government negotiates access to the single market on favourable terms,"" says commercial director Catherine Rohl.She is also worried about the supply of skilled workers. ""It is a concern, particularly here in Banbury where unemployment is very low. And if it is going to be more difficult to recruit from across the EU in future, then that becomes even more difficult.""She says the chancellor can help with that with more support for training, education and apprenticeships in science and engineering subjects.Nick Grey is the founder and chief executive of Gtech, a Worcester-based firm that makes cordless vacuum cleaners and garden tools.He would like the chancellor to support research and development by extending tax breaks for investment in R&D.""It's a good incentive, it's reasonably generous. Don't take it away definitely, and a bit more would be welcome,"" he says.In South Wales construction giant Costain is working on a £200m road project that involves building 16 structures, 12km (7.5 miles) of retaining walls and moving 2.5 million tonnes of soil and rocks.Bruce Richards, who is managing the project, says that 70% of the contracts involved have been awarded to firms in South Wales, creating 180 jobs in the process.""We believe the government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure. We hope in the Autumn Statement that way of thinking will continue,"" he says.Northern Ireland was one of the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis, with around a third of all jobs in the construction industry lost after 2008. ""The construction sector in Northern Ireland was very dramatically hit by the recession. I'm pleased to say now that we're starting to see a more fragile recovery,"" says Ray Hutchinson, managing director of Gilbert Ash, a construction firm that is building a new Marriott Hotel in Belfast. However, his company is focusing on the south-east of England where growth is stronger.Mr Ash says that ""a number"" of projects have been paused as clients weigh up the implications of Brexit.""We will be looking to the chancellor to increase spending on infrastructure,"" he says. ""Certainly that could have a very dramatic economic stimulus on the entire economy in the UK."""

They are waiting to receive the HPV vaccine, which will protect them from cervical cancer. The project is run by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which in turn has received a significant amount of funding from British taxpayers. With a budget of more than £12bn, the Department for International Development is an arm of government with spending power that is likely to keep growing. The UK has passed a bill that enshrines in law its commitment to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on aid every year.  But that commitment, while welcomed by some as a mark of British generosity, is dismissed by others as a licence to spend money on projects of dubious value. The Conservative MP and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell is a staunch defender.""There is massive need, we can see it in the world today, huge discrepancies of opportunity, deep, deep poverty,"" he says. ""The British development budget is addressing these colossal discrepancies, and it does so extremely effectively."" The current Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, once advocated scrapping the department she now leads. And since taking up the role, she has stressed that it is in Britain's ""national interest"" to invest across the world, to alleviate poverty and suffering. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in September, Ms Patel said: ""Our aid programme forms a crucial part of Britain's soft power around the world. ""When people in refugee camps or remote communities see the Union Jack displayed proudly on our emergency supplies, they know they have a friend and an ally in Britain."" Some believe that world view may be given extra impetus by the need to forge trade deals, in the wake of Brexit. But Kirsty McNeill, executive director of policy and campaigns at Save the Children, says we should give because we can.""If I saw a drowning man in the Thames on the way home tonight and I saved him, it may well do wonders for my reputation, but that's not why I do it - I do it because if you can save a life, you should save a life,"" she says. Jonathan Foreman, author of Aiding and Abetting: Foreign Aid Failures and the 0.7% Deception, takes a far more sceptical view.He says that far from being good for the national image, if money is handed over to people in a country who are known to be powerful and corrupt, it can be very damaging.""People in those countries think you must have known it was a corrupt country, you must have known that school was not going to be built, and then they think you are in league with the people whose mis-governance is making this country such an impoverished place,"" he says. There are other pitfalls too.Owen Barder, from the Centre for Global Development think tank, says: ""The US and in the past the EU shipped a lot of food aid from our own countries.""It was in the national interest to buy it from our farmers and ship it there, but it was much more expensive. ""Our aid saved many fewer lives, and we drove local farmers and local suppliers out of business."" Given that ""promoting global prosperity"" is among Dfid's priorities, putting local traders out of business is not part of the plan.But Michela Wrong, the author of It's our turn to Eat - which looks at corruption in Kenya, believes there is another problem with the UK's choice of aid partners. She points to countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia and Uganda, which, she says, are not particularly good at promoting democracy and human rights but are successful at building schools and improving maternal health.""Is that model really sustainable?"" she asks.Mr Mitchell accepts this is not ideal but says the aid relationship is not with the governments but with the people. And if you withdraw the aid, ""you're taking girls out of school, or stopping farmers accruing the knowledge to be able to feed themselves and their locality"". One of Ms Patel's priorities is to deliver value for money in aid - but some in the aid world argue it is not always easy to measure outcomes. You may be able to count the number of children that have been given access to a school, but how can you assess the quality of the education they have received? Many of these arguments have been thrashed out in the development world for decades, but Mr Barder says the problems traditionally linked to aid should have an even bigger resonance now because they try to address shared problems.""Like climate change, which we have to tackle together, problems of conflict and insecurity, problems of global health, of inequality and those requiring shared policy solutions, aid is part of the solution,"" says Mr Barder.""The votes we have seen on Brexit and Donald Trump are the people saying to the politicians, 'You are not addressing these problems fast enough and in the way we need.'"" But as electorates reject global trade deals and multinational groupings such as the EU, it may be more difficult than ever to persuade countries to work together. At the same time, the problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability.In Uganda, the plan is to end the support for the vaccination programme by 2020, when it is hoped the country will be wealthier. But for the moment, British taxpayers will continue to help protect the health of Ugandan children.  "
2016-11-17,Statement of intent,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38011185,"You may not have noticed it yet, but next week's Autumn Statement will be a big test of the prime minister's seriousness.  Theresa May is making an extraordinary claim - to be the Western leader who gets the zeitgeist, who has the answers others are too timid to grasp, without being so headstrong that she threatens the whole system of world capitalism. The overarching question about the chancellor's first major economic pronouncement will be ""What does it say about Brexit?"".This is entirely right and proper. Philip Hammond wouldn't be in charge of the UK economy without that vote - George Osborne would still be in post. The direction Mr Hammond takes will depend on whether he thinks Britain is more likely to boom or bust outside the European Union. In some quarters, he is already castigated for not sticking to a ""happy clappy"" script.Sensible people agree Brexit is an economic leap in the dark, destination unknown. But to some, acknowledging this is akin to heresy.  Our leap, they insist, will be on to a rainbow from where we will slide gently to a pot of gold.  If Mr Hammond's economic analysis suggests it might be best to brace for a bumpy landing on the rocks below - just in case - some will regard that as defeatist whingeing. We need to look out for growth and tax forecasts and measures to buttress a faltering economy, but tone and presentation will be important too. The shock absorbers he does - or does not - put in place will tell us something about this government's true perception of Brexit, but its ambitions to reshape the British economy are far more significant. It should tell us more about the intention and beliefs of the second most intriguing politician in the world - Mrs May. I would not have dreamed of writing that a few months ago, but as she herself said recently, we live in ""a world transformed"".Of course what she does as prime minister at a critical time for our country is important, but it is much more than that.She appears to be putting herself forward as the first leader in the world who will respond to a wave of populist discontent she neither encouraged nor summoned.  She makes clear her job is to ameliorate a mood that is sweeping the West. Her mission is nothing less than saving globalisation and free trade from themselves. We are familiar with the terms ""centre right"" or ""centre left"". She seems to want ""centre populism"".  This may of course turn out to be traditional conservatism reheated in the rhetoric de jour, or it might be a wholehearted embrace of the radical ideas of the new hard right. Last week I wrote about the similarities between Donald Trump's victory and Brexit. There are many differences between the leader of the UK and the next leader of the US but one in particular is critical.Mr Trump not only skilfully surfed the wave of populism, he summoned the waters, encouraged the swell and used its gathering force to propel himself into power. Here, by contrast, Mrs May was a mere bystander as the flood smashed the existing political order to matchsticks, the would-be surfers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spectacularly wiped out by the waves and David Cameron and Mr Osborne turned into so much flotsam and jetsam. She was picked up and swept along in the tumult and deposited, almost accidently, in a high place, dryish and in charge.Mrs May could have been briskly business-like and insisted the only instruction from the referendum was the simple one on the ballot paper - to leave the EU. ""Brexit means Brexit"" to coin a phrase. But Mrs May agrees with the academics and journalists who say it means far more, that voters were expressing a wider mood of discontent. In her recent speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet she repeated the central tenets of her party conference speech.Brexit was a message about immigration and anger at a rich elite, some of whom ignore the rules others must obey. But above all, she said, politicians and business people had to accept that ""globalisation in its current form has left too many people behind"". And ""we can do much more to ensure the prosperity [globalisation and free trade] provide is shared by all"".Read this out of context and you might guess she is attempting to out-Corbyn Jeremy. Repeating ""prosperity shared by all"" twice in her speech might lead you to believe that ""Red Phil"" will be ordered to use the Autumn Statement to introduce a wealth tax of 90% on incomes of more than £200,000 and big corporate profits, and use the proceeds to treble the minimum wage, quadruple pensions and add a big fat nought to all benefits.This is probably not Mrs May's way of ""sharing prosperity"". So what will she do?Mr Trump wants to bring back jobs by introducing tariffs. That's not Mrs May's way either. Indeed, she wants to be ""the strongest global advocate for free markets and free trade"".So what could bring ""the left behinds"" (TLBs) right up front? Her answer? A new industrial strategy. The test of Mrs May's seriousness will be if this is the centrepiece of the Autumn Statement.The shimmering outlines of what an industrial strategy might be are just about visible - ""backing up the strengths"" of great universities, dynamic businesses, creating ""conditions where winners can emerge"" and ""developing untapped potential"".It's still rather hazy. To convince, Mr Hammond has to come up with spending promises and tax incentives to make this feel like new policy which will substantially change lives.  There are some signs ""the left behinds"" may lose out again to a newer group which has caught the PM's eye - the so-called ""Just about managing"", or Jams. The proposed help for them seems to be more in the nature of headline-grabbing gimmicks than a real change in policy.   If this is all talk, Mrs May is playing a dangerous game with the public mood.She must know she does not have much leeway. Because the President-elect was so brutally frank about his extreme prescriptions on the road to power, he can afford to tone it down a bit now. Donnie Darkmouth can, to an extent, morph into Temperate Trump.  But Mrs May did not originally champion or encourage the people who put her in power. She is calculating what they want, not expressing a shared fury, which means she risks sounding too shrill for those who do not share her prescription, while not doing enough to meet TLB or Jam concerns. There is a danger too in falling in love with what is fast becoming an overwhelming narrative. Whilst ""the left behinds"" is a useful catch-all, I prefer the idea of ""the disconnect"". Politicians will not be serving the national interest if they get the idea that courting former industrial workers undergoing a crisis of identity is all that matters. This government has only revealed itself in fits and starts: long on talk, short on policy. Next week we might see if it will put our money where its mouth is.  "
2016-11-17,Numbers game,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37954098,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May's government is riding high in the opinion polls at the moment but could be vulnerable in Parliament. What does she need to do to keep her backbenchers on side?When she replaced him as prime minister in July, Theresa May also took on David Cameron's small Commons majority, and all the problems that come with it.The government's ""working majority"" - calculated when you take away the non-voting Speaker, deputy speakers and Sinn Fein members, as well as the two seats left vacant by the resignations of Conservatives Zac Goldsmith and Stephen Phillips - is just 14, meaning the prime minister needs to work extra hard to ensure her MPs back her, and her policies.If Labour, the SNP and other smaller parties work together on an issue, they need only to attract a handful of unhappy Conservatives - seven - to their side and the government risks defeat.Mrs May is widely regarded as one of the more ""unclubbable"" politicians, admitting when running for leadership of the Conservative party that she did not ""go drinking in Parliament's bars"" and preferred to get ""on with the job"".That has put her at a disadvantage, says The Spectator's Katy Balls, because she does not have a ready-made network of supporters.""Unlike George Osborne, who was constantly meeting with MPs and having drinks parties, Theresa May has never really courted her party like that,"" she says. ""They need a bit more TLC almost, to stay behaved. They're not getting that, which allows them to go a bit more rogue.""The single biggest issue on the prime minister's agenda is Brexit and, whether she likes it or not, it is likely to define her entire premiership.The government has been locked in a battle in the High Court against a ruling on triggering Article 50, the formal notification of leaving the EU. If the appeal in the Supreme Court fails and Mrs May is instead required to bring forward legislation in the Commons to trigger Brexit talks, she can expect to win the backing of her MPs. Labour will also vote in favour, though a handful of their MPs and some from smaller parties have told the BBC they will vote against.Former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who was a vocal Remain supporter during the campaign, has warned against the government's reluctance to allow Parliament to delve into the detail, arguing that a vote on Brexit would ""strengthen Theresa May's hand"".Another of her MPs has warned that the prime minister must not forget she has to take her MPs with her.Heidi Allen, whose maiden speech attacked the government's policy on tax credit cuts, says Mrs May is absolutely determined to deliver Brexit because that is what the British people want.""My sense is just that Theresa is an almost civil servant-like politician. She believes that she's got a job to do and nothing should stand in her way.""I think that it's her determination that's making her perhaps a little single-minded.""Former cabinet minister Peter Lilley is a veteran of the battles in the Conservative Party over Europe in the 1990s, which saw an organised rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty erode John Major's majority and turn him into a leader widely seen as lacking authority within his own party.Although Conservative MPs were broadly split over Leave and Remain before the referendum, Mr Lilley thinks most of them want to now make Brexit work.""They're relieved that the initial reaction of the economy has entirely wrong-footed the doom-mongers in the Treasury and the Bank of England,"" he says.""There's a feeling of pretty good unanimity. The vast majority of those who supported remain want to make a success of it.""Mrs May's political life is not all about Brexit.There has been disquiet over issues such as opening new grammar schools and welfare changes. Some are not happy over the ""trashing"" of David Cameron's legacy. So can the prime minister rely on that slim majority to hold?Ms Allen certainly thinks rebellion is a good thing, when well used.""We have a lot if independent-minded MPs,"" she says. ""We came here to make a difference, not just toe the party line.""Ms Soubry says she was heartened by the prime minister's first speech, delivered on the day she took over from Mr Cameron. Mrs May spoke of leading a government ""driven not by the interests of the privileged few"" and promised to make Britain ""a country that works for everyone"".However, Ms Soubry warns that her actions need to match her words.""If there's any disquiet, it's that Theresa needs now to be true now to the words, the sentiment, the admirable goals and her dream and vision of our country. She's now got to be true to what she said on the steps of Downing Street."""
2016-11-17,Is Boris bored?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38014012,"Boris Johnson is one of those few politicians whose notoriety gives their utterances a wider audience than Westminster. It is why he was such an effective advocate for Leave during the referendum. And it is why the prime minister will use him to sell the Brexit deal when eventually it is struck. So it will have come as no surprise to Mr Johnson to have attracted the attention this week of the actor Ewan McGregor - even if he might not have appreciated why. The star of Trainspotting and Star Wars, who has one million Twitter followers, used his social media account to criticise the foreign secretary for offering ""an impossible Brexit vision"". The cause of Mr McGregor's ire was Mr Johnson's interview with a Czech newspaper in which he suggested the UK might leave the EU customs union. This might not sound too controversial until you realise that doing that after Brexit is not actually government policy. Downing Street has deliberately kept its options open, leading some MPs to think that staying in the customs union will be part of a transitional period before full Brexit. Mr Johnson also claimed the free movement of people was not a fundamental EU freedom, even though it was set out in the Treaty of Rome. To some Conservative MPs, this is Boris being Boris: speaking truth clumsily and causing unnecessary offence. To others, it is Mr Johnson deliberately pushing the boundaries, trying to nudge Downing Street down a path that he and other Brexiteers wish to travel. Either way, the interview gave the prime minister's opponents a big stick with which to beat her at question time in the House of Commons. One MP said that Theresa May will not have liked that and pointed out that at no time did she refer to Mr Johnson or praise him during her replies. But one Downing Street source said: ""If you were to sit down with the PM tonight for a whisky, she would not tell you that Boris Johnson is a problem. Her big problem is getting Whitehall to deliver what she wants."" There are some around the prime minister, however, who do not mind Mr Johnson taking some flak for the complexities and contradictions that leaving the EU will entail. This week the Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told Newsnight that Mr Johnson was saying things that are ""intellectually impossible"". The Italian economic development minister Carlo Calenda accused Mr Johnson of being ""insulting"" for suggesting that Italy should support a trade deal with the UK to avoid losing sales in Prosecco sparkling wine. One source said: ""Boris is like a cut-off, absorbing some of the noise that would otherwise come our way.""That may be but it might still a problem for No 10 if the foreign secretary is unnecessarily picking fights with the EU when he should be building bridges. Some EU diplomats say his chummy way of addressing them in a few mangled words of their language can be patronising rather than engaging. Few think he has much influence over the Brexit process. He has also upset some of his counterparts, the most important being Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany. This has not gone unnoticed in Whitehall. Other government officials are more positive. They say Mr Johnson is popular in the Foreign Office in the way his predecessors were not. The junior staff like the way he says hello to them. The senior staff empathise with his curious intellect and linguistic hunger. And they like the way he takes his briefs seriously and masters the detail quickly. The problem, some say, is that Mr Johnson is bored. He is being kept on a tight leash by Downing Street. No big interviews allowed, no big speeches planned, just endless ""grip and grins"" with visiting politicians and ""get to know you"" goodwill trips abroad. There are only so many times you can say that Britain will be engaged with the world post-Brexit.So the hunt is on for a role for the foreign secretary, a focus for his energy. One idea doing the rounds is for Mr Johnson to throw himself into shaping the thinking, as much as he can, of the incoming Trump administration. There is, the argument goes, a vacuum in much of the president-elect's foreign policy and it will be up others to fill that gap. Others doubt the foreign secretary has been in his post long enough to have a settled world view that he can pass on to Mr Trump. What is Mr Johnson's real strategic view, they ask, on Russia, the Middle East and global trade? Yet, astonishing as it may seem, in a short while Mr Johnson will be one of Europe's longer-serving foreign secretaries. By the end of next May, France, Germany and Italy will almost certainly have new foreign ministers who will be working alongside an equally new American secretary of state. Despite that, some officials note that Mr Johnson has yet to be tested by a big foreign policy crisis, such as the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Will he have the clout to get Britain into the room, to shape the policy, to impose his will on a fast moving event? That, they say, will be the time to judge the foreign secretary rather than blaming him personally for the failure of the whole government thus far to agree a strategy on Brexit.  "
2016-11-17,Half-Brexit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118082615/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37987830,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkFreedom of movement, access to healthcare abroad, voting rights - some fundamental aspects of British life in the EU must be clarified before Brexit happens.A Luxembourg liberal MEP, Charles Goerens, has proposed offering British citizens the option of retaining their EU citizenship for a fee. This ""associate EU citizenship"" idea could be part of the Brexit negotiations but it raises all sorts of legal questions.The EU treaties say EU citizenship ""does not replace national citizenship"" but ""is additional to it"". So EU citizenship cannot be acquired by giving up UK citizenship. Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will lose their EU citizenship. And once Prime Minister Theresa May triggers the Article 50 withdrawal process, which she aims to do before next April, there will be just two years to resolve citizenship issues.Citizens' rights have to be part of the Article 50 negotiations because about 1.2 million UK citizens live in other EU countries and three million EU nationals live in the UK. They need to know what, if any, reciprocal rights they will continue to enjoy after Brexit. Important decisions about jobs, homes, pensions and healthcare could depend on those safeguards.EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to:Beyond those rights, EU law also provides many social protections for EU citizens in the areas of healthcare, work and pensions. An EU citizen can access another EU country's social security system, provided he or she has paid social insurance back home. An example is the EHIC health card - a passport to emergency treatment abroad.The reciprocal rights are called ""EU social security coordination"". The rules are complex, as social provision varies greatly from country to country.Mr Goerens proposes that UK citizens could pay an annual, individual membership fee directly into the EU budget to retain their EU citizenship after Brexit. He did not suggest any figure for that fee. An associate citizen would retain freedom of movement in the EU, the right to reside in another EU country under existing rules and the right to vote in European elections.The European Parliament will vote on the proposal next month - it is Amendment 882 in a long report on possible future EU treaty changes. It has generated much interest on social media and Mr Goerens says many British MEPs have expressed support.But even if MEPs back the proposal, it still has a long way to go. Brexit: All you need to knowBrexit court defeat for UK governmentWould Brexit violate UK citizens' rights?The need for treaty change makes this initiative very hard to achieve by the likely 2019 deadline for Brexit. It could only become law after a treaty change because it would change the nature of EU citizenship. But aggrieved pro-EU Britons may welcome the fact that Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt has backed the proposal. Mr Verhofstadt, an influential liberal, will be the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.EU leaders will inevitably have to change the treaties in the next few years because the UK's role will have to be deleted or amended in EU texts. However, a change to the nature of EU citizenship would require full ratification by all 28 member states - and that could not be done quickly, Prof Catherine Barnard, an expert on EU law, told the BBC.But the proposal, she said, at least showed a willingness in the EU to ""find creative ways to help the 48% who voted to Remain [in the EU]"". Camino Mortera-Martinez, an EU justice expert at the Centre for European Reform, said there was ""no appetite for treaty change in Brussels at the moment"". Next year politicians in the Netherlands, France and Germany will focus on general elections. They will want to avoid EU treaty changes, which are notoriously time-consuming and difficult. It took nearly nine years to draft and enact the Lisbon Treaty.Empowering MEPs to continue representing some UK citizens after Brexit would be another big legal hurdle.Prof Barnard questioned how an MEP could represent an area where ""half the constituents are not even associate EU citizens"". ""That is a non-starter,"" she said. If British ""associate EU citizens"" were to have continued freedom of movement, the UK would have to offer the EU something in return, both experts argue.But that is very problematic. The Brexit vote on 23 June made curbing immigration from the EU a top priority for Mrs May's government. Freedom of movement will be one of the thorniest issues.It would also be hard to get agreement on a fee for EU citizenship, Prof Barnard said. For example Spain, hosting many elderly Britons who use its healthcare system, might demand a high fee. If it took the form of a new EU tax, it would require extra bureaucrats to collect and allocate the income.The European Court of Justice would have to oversee associate citizenship - another thorny issue, because the whole idea of Brexit is for the UK to ""take back control"". So how could an EU court retain jurisdiction over UK citizens?And it could be discriminatory to offer associate EU citizenship only to UK citizens. Many Serbs and Turks might also demand it, as they would like to join the EU. "

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-18,Scots and Welsh to get say on Brexit case,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38027230,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Scottish and Welsh governments are to be allowed to have a say in the Supreme Court battle over how Brexit should be triggered.The government is appealing against a High Court ruling that MPs must get a vote on triggering Article 50.The Supreme Court confirmed that Wales and Scotland's senior law officers will be allowed to take part in the appeal.UK PM Theresa May said on Friday that work was ""on track"" to begin the formal process of Brexit by April 2017.At a joint press briefing with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, following a meeting with EU leaders in Berlin, Mrs May said: ""We stand ready to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017 and I want to see this as a smooth process, an orderly process, working towards a solution that's in the interests of both the UK and also in the interests of our European partners.""McCord Brexit case can go to Supreme CourtThe judges ruling on Brexit caseShe was speaking after the Supreme Court confirmed that Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, had been invited to address the court on the relevance of points of Scots law. The Counsel General for Wales will make arguments about the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law.The Supreme Court hearing is expected to start on 5 December and last four days, with the decision expected in the new year.AnalysisTom Bateman, BBC political correspondentThe government has been clear in its belief that the referendum result gives it the authority to use its executive powers to trigger the EU exit process. But the Scottish government believes this is unlawful, claiming that invoking Article 50 would involve a ""fundamental alteration"" in the UK's constitutional arrangements and the rights of Scottish people - who voted to remain in the EU - about which the Hollyrood parliament should be consulted. It is far from clear how much legal weight these arguments will carry in this complex constitutional case in front of 11 Supreme Court judges. But the politics are easier to predict: If the government's appeal fails, Parliament is likely to become the next battleground over the timing and - potentially - the terms of Brexit.It is a fight Downing Street is desperate to avoid - amid the increasingly toxic atmosphere between those tussling for control of Britain's departure from the EU.A government spokesman said it was ""a matter for the Supreme Court which applications to intervene are accepted"".""The UK government's position remains the same, and we will be taking strong legal arguments to court next month,"" he said.Scotland's Brexit minister Michael Russell welcomed the decision, but added: ""We continue to call on the UK government to drop the appeal and to accept that Parliament has the right to determine the triggering of Article 50. ""We recognise the decision of people in England and Wales to support Brexit, but the views of people in Scotland cannot simply be brushed aside.""The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which describes itself as ""fighting for the rights and welfare of some of the most vulnerable and under-represented workers in the UK"", has also been given permission to make submissions to the Supreme Court.The Attorney General for Northern Ireland has made a reference to the court on devolution issues and did not need permission to intervene. Separately another Brexit case brought by victims' campaigner Raymond McCord in Belfast has also been referred to the Supreme Court.Earlier this month three High Court judges ruled that the prime minister did not have the power to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start the two-year process of negotiating Brexit, without the prior authority of Parliament. Mrs May and her ministers are now asking the Supreme Court to overturn that unanimous decision.Labour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process if a vote goes ahead.But Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has said his party will vote against triggering Article 50, unless they are promised a second referendum on the UK's Brexit deal with EU leaders. Some Labour MPs have said they are also willing to oppose it.Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, believes that the consent of the Scottish Parliament and the UK's other devolved parliaments and assemblies should also be sought before Article 50 is triggered.Mick Antoniw AM, Counsel General for Wales, said previously: ""This case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution."" The legal challenge over Brexit was brought by investment fund manager and philanthropist Gina Miller, along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.After Lord Toulson's retirement this summer, the appeal will be heard by all 11 remaining Supreme Court justices, led by their President Lord Neuberger."
2016-11-18,MP's boundary bill clears first hurdle,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38025403,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA bid to stop plans that would cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 has cleared its first Commons hurdle.Labour MP Pat Glass's bill, which aims to retain the current number of MPs at 650, was backed by 253 votes to 37.But Tory David Nuttall accused some Labour MPs of opposing the plans because they feared being replaced by pro-Corbyn Momentum candidates.New government-backed boundary proposals would see fewer MPs and create equal-sized seats.Ms Glass's bid to retain the status quo of 650 MPs secured a second reading and will now proceed to committee stage. However, it is unlikely to become law without the support of the government.The changes proposed by the Boundary Commissions for England and Wales would ensure each constituency - with the exception of a few island seats - has a broadly similar population, but the moves are opposed by some Conservative and Labour MPs.Labour fears it will lose the most seats under the plans, intended to be introduced in time for a general election in 2020, which would ensure the number of people entitled to vote in each constituency is within 5% of 74,769.Ms Glass's Parliamentary Constituencies (Amendment) Bill aims to ensure constituencies are within 10% of the electoral quota, that the boundary commissions use more up-to-date data, and that reviews take place every 10 years, rather than five.In the Commons, Ms Glass told MPs her bill was not motivated by self-interest as she intends to stand down from her North West Durham constituency at the next general election.She argued that with the rise of anti-establishment politics and the emergence of far-right parties, MPs needed to reach out and engage with voters now more than ever.'Bigger than ourselves'By cutting the number of MPs and making their constituencies bigger and more remote, ministers endanger the current ""MP-constituency link which is envied in democracies across the world"", she said.But Conservative MP Mr Nuttall stepped in to argue: ""Isn't it the case the reason why this bill has been brought forward is that there are so many members on the benches opposite who are frightened of re-selection because of the threat of Momentum taking their seats?""That's the real reason why this bill has been brought forward.""Labour's Jess Phillips could be heard saying: ""Unlike you, we're not scared of democracy.""And Ms Glass told Mr Nuttall: ""I think that the unfortunate intervention is not helpful and just exemplifies why people out there get so angry about people in here.""This is about something bigger than ourselves.""'An opportunity?'But Tory former chief whip Mark Harper was critical of colleagues who opposed the planned reduction in their numbers. ""Listening to some MPs talk about the constituencies they currently represent, they do sound like they think they own them,"" he said.Momentum is a grassroots organisation set up to provide support for Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, following his election in 2015.His leadership was hit by a wave of resignations from his front bench in the aftermath of UK voting to leave the European Union in June, but he was re-elected party leader in September by an increased margin, with strong backing from party members.In September, Darren Williams - a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - suggested the overhaul of constituency boundaries may present ""an opportunity"" to force out MPs who have been ""consistently"" disloyal to leader Mr Corbyn."

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, he said there was more chance of him going into the jungle on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here than becoming a member of the House of Lords.When asked if he would accept a peerage, the MEP said: ""A) it's not going to happen and B) it's not what I want in my life at this moment in time.""When I'm old, you know, I might think about it.""Mr Farage was the first politician from the UK to meet with President-elect Trump after his surprise victory in last week's US election. He campaigned alongside Mr Trump in the race for the White House and said the businessman was willing to be ""very close partners"" with the UK.The incoming US president has spoken to Mrs May by phone and there have been other contacts between ministers and representatives of the incoming administration.Mrs May declined to rule out the idea of a peerage for Mr Farage when it was put to her during Prime Minister's Questions.SNP MP George Kerevan asked Mrs May whether there had been any ""official conversations"" about giving Mr Farage a peerage.As MPs laughed at the question, the prime minister replied: ""All I can say to him, I'm afraid, is that such matters are normally never discussed in public."""

2016-11-18,MPs call for 50% cut to air travel tax,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38014907,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkMPs are urging the government to halve air passenger duty in next week's Autumn Statement, saying the tax hampers post-Brexit Britain's ability to trade outside Europe.The British Infrastructure Group (BIG) claims the tax acts directly against a policy of extending UK business links to the ""farthest reaches of the globe"".The tax is set to rise again in April to £150 for some long-haul flights.Opponents accused the aviation industry of wanting a ""free ride"" on air taxes.In its report, BIG said air passenger duty (APD) should be cut by 50%, then scrapped altogether.Grant Shapps, the former international development minister who leads BIG, said Prime Minister Theresa May needs to make good on a promise she gave on Monday to ""forge a bold, new, confident future for ourselves in the world"".He said: ""Particularly post-Brexit, now is the time to do it."" He added that reducing APD could provide an immediate ""Brexit dividend"" because the government would not have to wait until Article 50 is triggered to make the cut.Britain has one of the highest air travel taxes in the world. On economy class flights of over 2,000 miles, passengers pay £73 in tax, which will rise to £75 next year. On long-haul business class journeys, flyers currently pay £146 in duty which will increase to £150 in April.   In the report, BIG cites industry figures that show UK APD for non-economy tickets is three times more expensive than France and four times higher than Germany. It notes that Ireland has scrapped APD completely. Also, Scotland is planning to reduce APD by 50% in 2018. ""APD has disproportionate effects on different tickets, disadvantaging flights to the Far East and especially to developing economies, where the cost of a plane ticket from London can be well over 10% tax,"" the report said.""If the government is to act on its commitments, especially those of securing new trading partners outside the EU, it must make it as easy as possible to do business, conduct negotiations and to stimulate the exchange of people and skills.""It cannot continue to actively make extra-European travel more expensive than it needs to be.""Some MPs will strongly resist any attempt to cut aviation taxes.  Earlier this week, the Environmental Audit Committee said the Treasury must consider the environmental impacts of its decisions.They are likely to point out that the biggest beneficiaries of a duty cut would be long-haul holiday makers, who might otherwise be spending their money in the UK.  Business passenger numbers are stagnant - the growth in demand is for holidays.They will mention that aviation is already uniquely protected from efforts to cut carbon emissions: under the government's plans, emissions from motoring and home heating will have to be cut to accommodate the growth in carbon dioxide from aviation. Critics are also likely to say that families travelling by air pay less tax per mile than car drivers, even though driving a family on holiday causes less pollution than going by plane.They will also question whether £150 tax will really deter a company director who has forked out for a business class seat.While the former Chancellor George Osborne exempted children under 16 from APD, the tax has continued to rise for adults.When it was introduced in 1994, the charge was £5 on short-haul flights and £10 on long-haul travel and was expected to generate £330m a year in revenue. APD now generates around an annual £3bn for the government. Mr Shapps argued a sharp drop in tax revenue from implementing a 50% cut would be recovered from increased trade outside Europe. He added that a reduction would allow Philip Hammond to ""stamp his own authority"" as chancellor in his first Autumn Statement next Wednesday since being appointed to the role. However, Mary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said: ""Transport is the highest emitting sector of the UK economy and there are already problems with the UK meeting our fourth carbon budget which starts in six years. ""We recommend that the chancellor green check all Autumn Statement decisions, especially any change to air passenger duty which could increase airport congestion and air pollution.""John Stewart, from pressure group HACAN, said that every year before the Autumn Statement, calls are ""trotted out"" for an end of APD.  ""Every year key facts are glossed over. For the vast majority of passengers it adds just £13 to a ticket, less than the cost of  breakfast at an airport terminal.  ""The aviation industry enjoys tax-free fuel.  If its fuel was taxed at the same rate as petrol for cars, airlines would end up paying much more than they do through APD.""Labour's environment spokesman Barry Gardiner MP said: ""Aviation needs to follow the polluter pays principle.""BIG are being disingenuous in claiming reduced tax is necessary for trade: any business committed to exporting to China isn't going to measure the cost/benefit in terms of £150 air passenger duty"".A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We keep all taxes under review, and do not comment on speculation around the Autumn Statement."""

It could be with any of the injuries but I think it makes more sense that the hands were up covering the face and the bullet has gone through the right hand and... into the head.""He continued: ""I concluded that she received multiple stab wounds to the back, front and left side of the chest and abdomen.""The stab wounds had penetrated her heart, left lung, stomach and liver.""The jury also heard evidence from a firearms expert, who said the bullets fired in the attack were more commonly used to kill vermin in a ""humane"" way.A plastic bag found in a holdall when Mr Mair was arrested had 25 live .22 calibre rounds inside - 12 manufactured in Britain and 13 made in Germany.Andre Horne, who has been an expert in his field for more than 20 years, said the bullets were designed to expand after being fired. This meant an animal was more likely to be killed straight away, rather than escaping with an injury that could lead to a slower death.""[It] would be considered a more humane way of disposing of animals,"" he added. ""They are most commonly used for hunting vermin, squirrels, rabbits and other small animals.""Mr Horne also said that the bullets could be legally owned in the UK with the correct firearms licence.Jurors were shown the modified .22 calibre Weihrauch rifle found with the bullets in the holdall. The bolt-action gun had its shoulder stock and all but 4cm of its barrel removed, which Mr Horne said allowed it to be shot with one hand - but decreased the penetrating power.Mr Whittam QC said to the expert: ""In its long form it's a firearm and you could have had lawful possession of it with a certificate. But in its reduced size it is a banned weapon in this country altogether?""Mr Horne replied: ""That's correct, yes.""Kerry Versfeld, of the National Ballistics Intelligence Service, confirmed the casings found at the scene had been fired by the same rifle.The court was also shown the dagger allegedly used to stab Mrs Cox, which Mr Horne said was most likely a ""fake replica"" of a Fairbairn-Sykes ""fighting dagger"" - a design first made in 1941 for British special forces and commando units.Forensic scientist Hilary Parkinson, a DNA profiling and blood pattern analysis expert, told the jury that Mr Mair's and Mrs Cox's DNA were found on the gun and the dagger.She said ""blood spots"" from Mrs Cox found on the gun showed that she had been very close to it and she said her findings were consistent with the dagger having been used to stab the Labour MP.Ms Parkinson told the jury that blood drips suggested the initial assault was at the end of the ramp by the library and the end of the assault was by two vehicles in Market Street.Her findings also suggested Mrs Cox had fallen and had possibly been crawling on the ground, she said.The trial continues.Jo Cox was a self-proclaimed ""proud Yorkshire lass"" whose work for charity took her around the world and whose political success led her to Westminster.The 41-year-old mother-of-two was elected as MP for Batley and Spen in the 2015 election and increased Labour's majority to 6,051 (from 4,406 in the 2010 election).She described herself as ""proud and humbled"" to be the Labour MP for the place where she was born.Mrs Cox first worked in politics after graduating from Cambridge University in 1995, but then built a career working for charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the NSPCC.She was described by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as ""a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for justice and peace.""Tireless campaigner turned political 'star'"

All the indications to date are that ministers are not prepared to give the NHS more money, although there have been rumours that council-run care services could see investment to help reduce demands on the health service.Mr Hopson criticised the way the current spending plans had been structured.He pointed out the rise in spending was actually £4.5bn rather than £8bn when cuts to other budgets, including those for training staff and money for public health schemes such as stop smoking services, was taken into account.He also said the extra demands being placed on hospitals, GPs and council-run care services had been underestimated, while the target to save £22bn in efficiencies by 2020 was ""too ambitious"".""For all these reasons, there is now a clear and widening gap between what is being asked of the NHS and the funding available to deliver it,"" Mr Hopson said. ""We are therefore asking for a new plan for the rest of the parliament to finalise or confirm the NHS budget and honestly and realistically set out what can be delivered. ""If there are no changes to the money available we will need to set out what the NHS stops doing. Right now the service cannot deliver what is being asked of it on the current budget.""He said that could include longer waiting times, rationing of non-emergency care such as knee and hip replacements and fewer doctors and nurses.Targets are already being missed in A&E and cancer care, while the waiting list for routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, has hit 3.7m up from 3m two years ago.But instead of prioritising hospitals, he said any extra money should be invested in GPs and council care services to try to stem the rising demands. He refused to say how much more the health service needed however.Meanwhile, the campaign group Equality 4 Mental Health, headed by Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb and Conservative Andrew Mitchell, called for more to be done to make sure extra money got through to mental health.The group - with the backing of nine former health secretaries - has said services are still being squeezed despite promises for care to be prioritised.Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, agreed there need to be a rethink on finances, saying a ""long-term solution"" was needed rather than the ""sticking plaster"" of the current plans. But the Department of Health defended its record. ""The government has taken tough economic decisions that have allowed us to invest in our NHS, which is meeting record patient demand while improving standards of care.""

Carwyn Jones told AMs ""transitional arrangements"" would be needed to avoid trade ""falling off a cliff"". The prime minister has said the formal Brexit negotiation process will begin by the end of March, with the UK set to leave the EU by summer 2019. On Friday, Mr Jones said putting new trade arrangements in place within that timescale would be a ""world record"". Giving evidence to the assembly's committee for the scrutiny of the first minister, he said: ""I think it is hugely difficult to imagine a scenario where within two-years-and-a-bit there is a comprehensive arrangement between the UK and the EU.""""I think that would be a world record in terms of getting that done in that amount of time.""The UK government needs to look at what needs to be done to bridge any gap that might be between the ending of the Article 50 process and a more lasting, sustainable settlement to avoid going off the edge of a cliff and then having to climb back up it when a lasting solution is found.""Mr Jones added that there was a ""need to think about what the transitional arrangements might be whilst respecting, of course, the results of the referendum.""He also called for a new independent body to adjudicate disputes between the devolved governments and the UK Treasury.In the event of a disagreement between Whitehall and Cardiff, Edinburgh or Belfast on how financial decisions should be made following Brexit, Mr Jones said: ""The UK will have to develop its structure as we leave the EU. ""We can't go to a situation where decisions on the UK's internal market, or financial decisions, are governed entirely by Whitehall - there has to be agreement between governments.""Meanwhile the Supreme Court has said it will allow the Scottish and Welsh governments to intervene in the UK government's appeal against a ruling that Parliament must be consulted on the triggering of the formal Brexit process.  In Friday's scrutiny session in Cardiff Bay, Mr Jones also said UK ministers needed to take ""more of an interest"" in the steel industry to secure its future.Commenting on the current position at Tata's Port Talbot plant, the first minister said there had been less ""engagement"" with the firm under Theresa May's leadership than there there had been under her predecessor David Cameron.Downing Street has been asked to respond.

2016-11-18,Chancellor 'still aspires for surplus',https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38017223,"Philip Hammond is expected say in his Autumn Statement he will still aim to achieve a budget surplus, despite abandoning a formal target by George Osborne to do so by 2020.The chancellor's friend, MP Stephen Hammond, said Mr Hammond planned to set out an ""intellectual framework"" to bring the economy back to surplus.But this would not be achieved until the economy has been stabilised after the uncertainty of the Brexit vote.The Autumn Statement is on Wednesday.Stephen Hammond said the chancellor would use his more flexible approach to allow for some extra spending on infrastructure. But this will be targeted to ensure it produces a return.Stephen Hammond added that he expected the chancellor to deliver a ""steady-as-she-goes"" Autumn Statement with no rabbits out of the hat in the style of his predecessor and Gordon Brown. The chancellor wants the Autumn Statement to return to its original purpose as the lower profile of the two ""fiscal events"" of the year with major tax changes left to the budget in the spring.The Treasury prompted speculation over the summer that it would adopt a looser fiscal policy - covering tax and spending - when the chancellor formally endorsed one of Theresa May's main pledges in the brief Conservative leadership contest. This was to abandon George Osborne's target of achieving an overall budget surplus by the time of the next election in 2020. This would mean that public spending would no longer outstrip incoming revenue.In his BBC Newsnight interview, Stephen Hammond said the chancellor will make clear in his Autumn Statement that he is still committed to achieving fiscal discipline and to achieving a surplus. But he will avoid setting a specific target date.The former transport minister, who has known his namesake for 25 years but is unrelated to the chancellor, told Newsnight: ""I think the Autumn Statement will see him reacting to the events, suggesting that some of the tight targets set out by George which looked feasible at the time, to be fair, now must be more uncertain because of the progress of the economy.""But intellectually the framework remains the same - that we intend to achieve a fiscal surplus within the life of the next parliament.""Stephen Hammond said that the chancellor believes it is right to adopt a more flexible approach to give the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility time to assess the extent of the impact of the economy EU referendum. He said: ""We live in very uncertain economic times. The fact that two or three months of relatively good economic news has come through does not mean by any means this economy is going have an easy ride after Brexit. ""So I think his statement about looking at the surplus targets and softening slightly them reflects that there is still quite a lot of uncertainty about the progress of the economy. ""But underlying that you will see Philip put in place fiscal disciplines that do ensure the economy comes back to surplus.""The chancellor is also expected to make clear next week that he sanctions a mild loosening of the purse strings to allow for infrastructure spending which could include so-called infrastructure bonds. But this will be within a strict fiscal framework.Stephen Hammond said: ""Anyone who thinks Philip Hammond is going to be Keynes has probably misunderstood his economic philosophy. ""But what it will be is accepting that there are things the government can and should do to ensure the economy continues to prosper in difficult times. ""Some of that is slowing down a little bit on fiscal discipline.  But it means ensuring that the progress to budget surplus is still there. ""Some of it is ensuring that the projects you spend are there and can generate jobs but there is value for money and its proven business case.""The Autumn Statement will mark a departure from the approach taken by George Osborne in another key area - the chancellor will adopt a steady-as-she-goes approach. There may be some modest measures, possibly a freeze in fuel duty and measures to encourage saving, aimed at the key group of voters identified by Downing Street - the so-called Just About Managing people (JAMs). But major tax changes will have to wait until the Budget.Nicholas Watt is political editor for BBC Newsnight - more on this story on the programme at 22:30 GMT on BBC Two"
2016-11-18,Abuse inquiry panellist defends head,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38022074,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA panel member of the independent inquiry into child sex abuse has defended chairwoman Prof Alexis Jay as being ""qualified for the job.""The Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, for 600 victims who lived in children's homes in London, is pulling out of the inquiry because of its leadership. But Dru Sharpling said it would not prevent the inquiry from carrying on. Labour MP Chuka Umunna has called for a new head, but Home Secretary Amber Rudd has backed Prof Jay's leadership. The inquiry said its work would continue with ""confidence and clarity"", and Prime Minister Theresa May this week said she had absolute confidence in the inquiry's leadership. The treatment of children in care in Lambeth, south London, from the 1950s onwards is one of 13 areas the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) is due to look at.It will investigate the claim that a large paedophile network infiltrated children's homes in the area, run by Lambeth Council, with the Shirley Oaks group due to have been a ""core participant"" in the process.Ms Sharpling said Prof Jay, who also led the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was the right woman for the task ahead. ""One woman uncovered that abuse and that was Alexis Jay,"" she told the BBC. ""I think she is one of the few people qualified for the job.""She added: ""I'm very sorry Shirley Oaks Survivors Group has decided to withdraw but it is not going to prevent us from continuing the investigation. To be frank it gives us all the passion that we need to take it forward and although it has been a difficult start for this inquiry, we are determined to see it through no matter what.""Raymond Stevenson, who has spoken about being physically abused during his time at the Shirley Oaks home in the 1970s, said the group's members had voted ""overwhelmingly"" on Saturday to pull out of the inquiry.Mr Stevenson told the BBC that the group ""felt relieved not to be part of this mangled attempt to get belated justice for our members"" and he called the inquiry an ""unpalatable circus"". He added: ""The inquiry has just lurched from disaster to disaster and we do not believe Alexis Jay, the chair, is the right person to wrench open the Pandora's box of historical lies and cover-ups that have happened over the decades.""The inquiry has been beset by difficulties since it was set up in July 2014 to investigate allegations made against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions in England and Wales, as well as people in the public eye.Three chairwomen - former president of the High Court Family Division Baroness Butler-Sloss, her replacement, leading lawyer Dame Fiona Woolf, and Justice Goddard, a New Zealand high court judge - have already stood down before Prof Jay took her place. A number of senior lawyers on the inquiry have also quit - the most recent of which was Aileen McColgan, who resigned on Wednesday amid concerns about the inquiry's leadership.Shirley Oaks Survivors Group had threatened to withdraw before, questioning the inquiry's independence and claiming that the Home Office, which sponsors the inquiry and provided some of its staff, had a role in covering up abuse in the past. Now it is planning to publish the results of its own investigation.Ms Rudd has also come out in defence of Prof Jay and said: ""We owe it to victims and survivors to get behind the inquiry, and its chair.""She added that the inquiry had a ""vital role to play in exposing the failure of public bodies and other major organisations to prevent child sexual abuse"".But the group said she was planning nothing more than a ""social work talk shop"", which it said would achieve nothing, and described her as ""an uninspiring leader"".Their local MP for Streatham, Mr Umunna, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was also concerned whether Prof Jay would be able to ""bring the heft and forensic capacity of a judge"" to the inquiry.He also said there was concern about her social work background because ""for many of the survivors... a lot the perpetrators came from that profession"", and further concern about the ""severe dysfunction"" in the legal team.""So for all those reasons I don't have confidence in this chair and I think we need a new one,"" he said.Peter Saunders, the founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood who sits on the inquiry's victims advisory panel, told Today the inquiry should not be ""distracted by just one group"". ""This inquiry, for all its challenges, is the best chance that we've all got and we need to support it, not keep having a go at it."""
2016-11-18,Brexit dominates cross-border talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-38019901,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA meeting of the North South Ministerial Council has taken place in Armagh.Brexit dominated that talks between ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The meeting was hosted by First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny was accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan. The delegates were significantly split on the issue of Brexit, but all four agreed the meeting had been constructive and worthwhile.Mr Kenny said it was one of the best meetings on Brexit so far.He told a press conference that topics covered included the land border, peace funds, treaties and the free movement of people and goods across the island.He said delegates from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland must work together in the ""common interests of the island of Ireland"" in order to get the best deal when talks begin.Mrs Foster said ""triangular"" discussions between Dublin, London and Belfast would continue.She said: ""We will wait to see what happens at the Supreme Court and take it from there.""All 11 senior judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom will decide whether the government has the power to trigger Article 50 of the EU Lisbon Treaty to begin Brexit.Mr McGuinness told the press conference he believes the UK government is not certain what Brexit means so ""everything is on the table"".Mr Flanagan said the meeting was ""interesting, significant and important"".Mrs Foster's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) campaigned in favour of the UK leaving the European Union, while Sinn Féin and the Irish government both supported the Remain campaign.These tensions were evident at the last NSMC plenary meeting at Dublin Castle in July, which took place just weeks after the UK's EU referendum result.Ahead of that meeting, Mr Kenny released a public statement proposing the formation of a new all-Ireland forum to deal with the implications of Brexit.However, Mrs Foster said she had not been consulted about the idea in advance, adding there were already ""more than enough"" cross-border bodies to address the issue.When the all-Ireland forum, or ""civic dialogue"" on Brexit met for the first time earlier this month, unionist parties including the DUP did not attend. Mrs Foster described it as a ""grandstanding exercise"" and said she had better things to do than be a ""lone voice among remoaners"".Earlier this week, Mrs Foster travelled to Dublin for talks with Mr Kenny on the implications of Brexit. It was their first political meeting since she told the DUP conference that Irish government officials were being ""sent out around the world to talk down our economy and attempt to poach our investors""."

2016-11-18,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

While recent data has shown a robust economy, a slowdown in growth is being forecast for next year.Uncertainty over Brexit has weakened the pound, which has been great for exporters but has made imported goods and raw materials more expensive.The BBC has been speaking to businesses from across the UK, finding out how their bosses are feeling and what they would like to see from the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, 23 November.In Scunthorpe Shay Eddy, the managing director of SC4 Steel which supplies the construction industry, is feeling optimistic.""We're certainly in a better position than we were 12 months ago.""We invested at the bottom of the cycle, we ordered a new machine that's just been commissioned now. We've just committed to another machine and we're looking at expanding and exporting starting January next year.""But like other businesses, he wants to know more about the UK's future relationship with Europe.""More clarity would be ideal because uncertainty is no good for anybody, but we can't expect the government to tip their hand as to what they are going to be negotiating with,"" he says.Norbar Torque Tools, based in Banbury, is one of Oxfordshire's best known exporters. As 35% of its sales go to mainland Europe the firm is closely watching the Brexit debate.""The single most important thing for exporting companies like us is that the government negotiates access to the single market on favourable terms,"" says commercial director Catherine Rohl.She is also worried about the supply of skilled workers. ""It is a concern, particularly here in Banbury where unemployment is very low. And if it is going to be more difficult to recruit from across the EU in future, then that becomes even more difficult.""She says the chancellor can help with that with more support for training, education and apprenticeships in science and engineering subjects.Nick Grey is the founder and chief executive of Gtech, a Worcester-based firm that makes cordless vacuum cleaners and garden tools.He would like the chancellor to support research and development by extending tax breaks for investment in R&D.""It's a good incentive, it's reasonably generous. Don't take it away definitely, and a bit more would be welcome,"" he says.In South Wales construction giant Costain is working on a £200m road project that involves building 16 structures, 12km (7.5 miles) of retaining walls and moving 2.5 million tonnes of soil and rocks.Bruce Richards, who is managing the project, says that 70% of the contracts involved have been awarded to firms in South Wales, creating 180 jobs in the process.""We believe the government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure. We hope in the Autumn Statement that way of thinking will continue,"" he says.Northern Ireland was one of the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis, with around a third of all jobs in the construction industry lost after 2008. ""The construction sector in Northern Ireland was very dramatically hit by the recession. I'm pleased to say now that we're starting to see a more fragile recovery,"" says Ray Hutchinson, managing director of Gilbert Ash, a construction firm that is building a new Marriott Hotel in Belfast. However, his company is focusing on the south-east of England where growth is stronger.Mr Ash says that ""a number"" of projects have been paused as clients weigh up the implications of Brexit.""We will be looking to the chancellor to increase spending on infrastructure,"" he says. ""Certainly that could have a very dramatic economic stimulus on the entire economy in the UK."""
2016-11-18,Give and take,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38013591,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA class of Ugandan schoolgirls lines up under a tree. They are waiting to receive the HPV vaccine, which will protect them from cervical cancer. The project is run by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which in turn has received a significant amount of funding from British taxpayers. With a budget of more than £12bn, the Department for International Development is an arm of government with spending power that is likely to keep growing. The UK has passed a bill that enshrines in law its commitment to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on aid every year.  But that commitment, while welcomed by some as a mark of British generosity, is dismissed by others as a licence to spend money on projects of dubious value. The Conservative MP and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell is a staunch defender.""There is massive need, we can see it in the world today, huge discrepancies of opportunity, deep, deep poverty,"" he says. ""The British development budget is addressing these colossal discrepancies, and it does so extremely effectively."" The current Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, once advocated scrapping the department she now leads. And since taking up the role, she has stressed that it is in Britain's ""national interest"" to invest across the world, to alleviate poverty and suffering. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in September, Ms Patel said: ""Our aid programme forms a crucial part of Britain's soft power around the world. ""When people in refugee camps or remote communities see the Union Jack displayed proudly on our emergency supplies, they know they have a friend and an ally in Britain."" Some believe that world view may be given extra impetus by the need to forge trade deals, in the wake of Brexit. But Kirsty McNeill, executive director of policy and campaigns at Save the Children, says we should give because we can.""If I saw a drowning man in the Thames on the way home tonight and I saved him, it may well do wonders for my reputation, but that's not why I do it - I do it because if you can save a life, you should save a life,"" she says. Jonathan Foreman, author of Aiding and Abetting: Foreign Aid Failures and the 0.7% Deception, takes a far more sceptical view.He says that far from being good for the national image, if money is handed over to people in a country who are known to be powerful and corrupt, it can be very damaging.""People in those countries think you must have known it was a corrupt country, you must have known that school was not going to be built, and then they think you are in league with the people whose mis-governance is making this country such an impoverished place,"" he says. There are other pitfalls too.Owen Barder, from the Centre for Global Development think tank, says: ""The US and in the past the EU shipped a lot of food aid from our own countries.""It was in the national interest to buy it from our farmers and ship it there, but it was much more expensive. ""Our aid saved many fewer lives, and we drove local farmers and local suppliers out of business."" Given that ""promoting global prosperity"" is among Dfid's priorities, putting local traders out of business is not part of the plan.But Michela Wrong, the author of It's our turn to Eat - which looks at corruption in Kenya, believes there is another problem with the UK's choice of aid partners. She points to countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia and Uganda, which, she says, are not particularly good at promoting democracy and human rights but are successful at building schools and improving maternal health.""Is that model really sustainable?"" she asks.Mr Mitchell accepts this is not ideal but says the aid relationship is not with the governments but with the people. And if you withdraw the aid, ""you're taking girls out of school, or stopping farmers accruing the knowledge to be able to feed themselves and their locality"". One of Ms Patel's priorities is to deliver value for money in aid - but some in the aid world argue it is not always easy to measure outcomes. You may be able to count the number of children that have been given access to a school, but how can you assess the quality of the education they have received? Many of these arguments have been thrashed out in the development world for decades, but Mr Barder says the problems traditionally linked to aid should have an even bigger resonance now because they try to address shared problems.""Like climate change, which we have to tackle together, problems of conflict and insecurity, problems of global health, of inequality and those requiring shared policy solutions, aid is part of the solution,"" says Mr Barder.""The votes we have seen on Brexit and Donald Trump are the people saying to the politicians, 'You are not addressing these problems fast enough and in the way we need.'"" But as electorates reject global trade deals and multinational groupings such as the EU, it may be more difficult than ever to persuade countries to work together. At the same time, the problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability.In Uganda, the plan is to end the support for the vaccination programme by 2020, when it is hoped the country will be wealthier. But for the moment, British taxpayers will continue to help protect the health of Ugandan children.  "
2016-11-18,Statement of intent,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38011185,"You may not have noticed it yet, but next week's Autumn Statement will be a big test of the prime minister's seriousness.  Theresa May is making an extraordinary claim - to be the Western leader who gets the zeitgeist, who has the answers others are too timid to grasp, without being so headstrong that she threatens the whole system of world capitalism. The overarching question about the chancellor's first major economic pronouncement will be ""What does it say about Brexit?"".This is entirely right and proper. Philip Hammond wouldn't be in charge of the UK economy without that vote - George Osborne would still be in post. The direction Mr Hammond takes will depend on whether he thinks Britain is more likely to boom or bust outside the European Union. In some quarters, he is already castigated for not sticking to a ""happy clappy"" script.Sensible people agree Brexit is an economic leap in the dark, destination unknown. But to some, acknowledging this is akin to heresy.  Our leap, they insist, will be on to a rainbow from where we will slide gently to a pot of gold.  If Mr Hammond's economic analysis suggests it might be best to brace for a bumpy landing on the rocks below - just in case - some will regard that as defeatist whingeing. We need to look out for growth and tax forecasts and measures to buttress a faltering economy, but tone and presentation will be important too. The shock absorbers he does - or does not - put in place will tell us something about this government's true perception of Brexit, but its ambitions to reshape the British economy are far more significant. It should tell us more about the intention and beliefs of the second most intriguing politician in the world - Mrs May. I would not have dreamed of writing that a few months ago, but as she herself said recently, we live in ""a world transformed"".Of course what she does as prime minister at a critical time for our country is important, but it is much more than that.She appears to be putting herself forward as the first leader in the world who will respond to a wave of populist discontent she neither encouraged nor summoned.  She makes clear her job is to ameliorate a mood that is sweeping the West. Her mission is nothing less than saving globalisation and free trade from themselves. We are familiar with the terms ""centre right"" or ""centre left"". She seems to want ""centre populism"".  This may of course turn out to be traditional conservatism reheated in the rhetoric de jour, or it might be a wholehearted embrace of the radical ideas of the new hard right. Last week I wrote about the similarities between Donald Trump's victory and Brexit. There are many differences between the leader of the UK and the next leader of the US but one in particular is critical.Mr Trump not only skilfully surfed the wave of populism, he summoned the waters, encouraged the swell and used its gathering force to propel himself into power. Here, by contrast, Mrs May was a mere bystander as the flood smashed the existing political order to matchsticks, the would-be surfers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spectacularly wiped out by the waves and David Cameron and Mr Osborne turned into so much flotsam and jetsam. She was picked up and swept along in the tumult and deposited, almost accidently, in a high place, dryish and in charge.Mrs May could have been briskly business-like and insisted the only instruction from the referendum was the simple one on the ballot paper - to leave the EU. ""Brexit means Brexit"" to coin a phrase. But Mrs May agrees with the academics and journalists who say it means far more, that voters were expressing a wider mood of discontent. In her recent speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet she repeated the central tenets of her party conference speech.Brexit was a message about immigration and anger at a rich elite, some of whom ignore the rules others must obey. But above all, she said, politicians and business people had to accept that ""globalisation in its current form has left too many people behind"". And ""we can do much more to ensure the prosperity [globalisation and free trade] provide is shared by all"".Read this out of context and you might guess she is attempting to out-Corbyn Jeremy. Repeating ""prosperity shared by all"" twice in her speech might lead you to believe that ""Red Phil"" will be ordered to use the Autumn Statement to introduce a wealth tax of 90% on incomes of more than £200,000 and big corporate profits, and use the proceeds to treble the minimum wage, quadruple pensions and add a big fat nought to all benefits.This is probably not Mrs May's way of ""sharing prosperity"". So what will she do?Mr Trump wants to bring back jobs by introducing tariffs. That's not Mrs May's way either. Indeed, she wants to be ""the strongest global advocate for free markets and free trade"".So what could bring ""the left behinds"" (TLBs) right up front? Her answer? A new industrial strategy. The test of Mrs May's seriousness will be if this is the centrepiece of the Autumn Statement.The shimmering outlines of what an industrial strategy might be are just about visible - ""backing up the strengths"" of great universities, dynamic businesses, creating ""conditions where winners can emerge"" and ""developing untapped potential"".It's still rather hazy. To convince, Mr Hammond has to come up with spending promises and tax incentives to make this feel like new policy which will substantially change lives.  There are some signs ""the left behinds"" may lose out again to a newer group which has caught the PM's eye - the so-called ""Just about managing"", or Jams. The proposed help for them seems to be more in the nature of headline-grabbing gimmicks than a real change in policy.   If this is all talk, Mrs May is playing a dangerous game with the public mood.She must know she does not have much leeway. Because the President-elect was so brutally frank about his extreme prescriptions on the road to power, he can afford to tone it down a bit now. Donnie Darkmouth can, to an extent, morph into Temperate Trump.  But Mrs May did not originally champion or encourage the people who put her in power. She is calculating what they want, not expressing a shared fury, which means she risks sounding too shrill for those who do not share her prescription, while not doing enough to meet TLB or Jam concerns. There is a danger too in falling in love with what is fast becoming an overwhelming narrative. Whilst ""the left behinds"" is a useful catch-all, I prefer the idea of ""the disconnect"". Politicians will not be serving the national interest if they get the idea that courting former industrial workers undergoing a crisis of identity is all that matters. This government has only revealed itself in fits and starts: long on talk, short on policy. Next week we might see if it will put our money where its mouth is.  "

What does she need to do to keep her backbenchers on side?When she replaced him as prime minister in July, Theresa May also took on David Cameron's small Commons majority, and all the problems that come with it.The government's ""working majority"" - calculated when you take away the non-voting Speaker, deputy speakers and Sinn Fein members, as well as the two seats left vacant by the resignations of Conservatives Zac Goldsmith and Stephen Phillips - is just 14, meaning the prime minister needs to work extra hard to ensure her MPs back her, and her policies.If Labour, the SNP and other smaller parties work together on an issue, they need only to attract a handful of unhappy Conservatives - seven - to their side and the government risks defeat.Mrs May is widely regarded as one of the more ""unclubbable"" politicians, admitting when running for leadership of the Conservative party that she did not ""go drinking in Parliament's bars"" and preferred to get ""on with the job"".That has put her at a disadvantage, says The Spectator's Katy Balls, because she does not have a ready-made network of supporters.""Unlike George Osborne, who was constantly meeting with MPs and having drinks parties, Theresa May has never really courted her party like that,"" she says. ""They need a bit more TLC almost, to stay behaved. They're not getting that, which allows them to go a bit more rogue.""The single biggest issue on the prime minister's agenda is Brexit and, whether she likes it or not, it is likely to define her entire premiership.The government has been locked in a battle in the High Court against a ruling on triggering Article 50, the formal notification of leaving the EU. If the appeal in the Supreme Court fails and Mrs May is instead required to bring forward legislation in the Commons to trigger Brexit talks, she can expect to win the backing of her MPs. Labour will also vote in favour, though a handful of their MPs and some from smaller parties have told the BBC they will vote against.Former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who was a vocal Remain supporter during the campaign, has warned against the government's reluctance to allow Parliament to delve into the detail, arguing that a vote on Brexit would ""strengthen Theresa May's hand"".Another of her MPs has warned that the prime minister must not forget she has to take her MPs with her.Heidi Allen, whose maiden speech attacked the government's policy on tax credit cuts, says Mrs May is absolutely determined to deliver Brexit because that is what the British people want.""My sense is just that Theresa is an almost civil servant-like politician. She believes that she's got a job to do and nothing should stand in her way.""I think that it's her determination that's making her perhaps a little single-minded.""Former cabinet minister Peter Lilley is a veteran of the battles in the Conservative Party over Europe in the 1990s, which saw an organised rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty erode John Major's majority and turn him into a leader widely seen as lacking authority within his own party.Although Conservative MPs were broadly split over Leave and Remain before the referendum, Mr Lilley thinks most of them want to now make Brexit work.""They're relieved that the initial reaction of the economy has entirely wrong-footed the doom-mongers in the Treasury and the Bank of England,"" he says.""There's a feeling of pretty good unanimity. The vast majority of those who supported remain want to make a success of it.""Mrs May's political life is not all about Brexit.There has been disquiet over issues such as opening new grammar schools and welfare changes. Some are not happy over the ""trashing"" of David Cameron's legacy. So can the prime minister rely on that slim majority to hold?Ms Allen certainly thinks rebellion is a good thing, when well used.""We have a lot if independent-minded MPs,"" she says. ""We came here to make a difference, not just toe the party line.""Ms Soubry says she was heartened by the prime minister's first speech, delivered on the day she took over from Mr Cameron. Mrs May spoke of leading a government ""driven not by the interests of the privileged few"" and promised to make Britain ""a country that works for everyone"".However, Ms Soubry warns that her actions need to match her words.""If there's any disquiet, it's that Theresa needs now to be true now to the words, the sentiment, the admirable goals and her dream and vision of our country. She's now got to be true to what she said on the steps of Downing Street."""
2016-11-18,Is Boris bored?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38014012,"Boris Johnson is one of those few politicians whose notoriety gives their utterances a wider audience than Westminster. It is why he was such an effective advocate for Leave during the referendum. And it is why the prime minister will use him to sell the Brexit deal when eventually it is struck. So it will have come as no surprise to Mr Johnson to have attracted the attention this week of the actor Ewan McGregor - even if he might not have appreciated why. The star of Trainspotting and Star Wars, who has one million Twitter followers, used his social media account to criticise the foreign secretary for offering ""an impossible Brexit vision"". The cause of Mr McGregor's ire was Mr Johnson's interview with a Czech newspaper in which he suggested the UK might leave the EU customs union. This might not sound too controversial until you realise that doing that after Brexit is not actually government policy. Downing Street has deliberately kept its options open, leading some MPs to think that staying in the customs union will be part of a transitional period before full Brexit. Mr Johnson also claimed the free movement of people was not a fundamental EU freedom, even though it was set out in the Treaty of Rome. To some Conservative MPs, this is Boris being Boris: speaking truth clumsily and causing unnecessary offence. To others, it is Mr Johnson deliberately pushing the boundaries, trying to nudge Downing Street down a path that he and other Brexiteers wish to travel. Either way, the interview gave the prime minister's opponents a big stick with which to beat her at question time in the House of Commons. One MP said that Theresa May will not have liked that and pointed out that at no time did she refer to Mr Johnson or praise him during her replies. But one Downing Street source said: ""If you were to sit down with the PM tonight for a whisky, she would not tell you that Boris Johnson is a problem. Her big problem is getting Whitehall to deliver what she wants."" There are some around the prime minister, however, who do not mind Mr Johnson taking some flak for the complexities and contradictions that leaving the EU will entail. This week the Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told Newsnight that Mr Johnson was saying things that are ""intellectually impossible"". The Italian economic development minister Carlo Calenda accused Mr Johnson of being ""insulting"" for suggesting that Italy should support a trade deal with the UK to avoid losing sales in Prosecco sparkling wine. One source said: ""Boris is like a cut-off, absorbing some of the noise that would otherwise come our way.""That may be but it might still a problem for No 10 if the foreign secretary is unnecessarily picking fights with the EU when he should be building bridges. Some EU diplomats say his chummy way of addressing them in a few mangled words of their language can be patronising rather than engaging. Few think he has much influence over the Brexit process. He has also upset some of his counterparts, the most important being Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany. This has not gone unnoticed in Whitehall. Other government officials are more positive. They say Mr Johnson is popular in the Foreign Office in the way his predecessors were not. The junior staff like the way he says hello to them. The senior staff empathise with his curious intellect and linguistic hunger. And they like the way he takes his briefs seriously and masters the detail quickly. The problem, some say, is that Mr Johnson is bored. He is being kept on a tight leash by Downing Street. No big interviews allowed, no big speeches planned, just endless ""grip and grins"" with visiting politicians and ""get to know you"" goodwill trips abroad. There are only so many times you can say that Britain will be engaged with the world post-Brexit.So the hunt is on for a role for the foreign secretary, a focus for his energy. One idea doing the rounds is for Mr Johnson to throw himself into shaping the thinking, as much as he can, of the incoming Trump administration. There is, the argument goes, a vacuum in much of the president-elect's foreign policy and it will be up others to fill that gap. Others doubt the foreign secretary has been in his post long enough to have a settled world view that he can pass on to Mr Trump. What is Mr Johnson's real strategic view, they ask, on Russia, the Middle East and global trade? Yet, astonishing as it may seem, in a short while Mr Johnson will be one of Europe's longer-serving foreign secretaries. By the end of next May, France, Germany and Italy will almost certainly have new foreign ministers who will be working alongside an equally new American secretary of state. Despite that, some officials note that Mr Johnson has yet to be tested by a big foreign policy crisis, such as the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Will he have the clout to get Britain into the room, to shape the policy, to impose his will on a fast moving event? That, they say, will be the time to judge the foreign secretary rather than blaming him personally for the failure of the whole government thus far to agree a strategy on Brexit.  "
2016-11-18,Half-Brexit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161118224524/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37987830,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkFreedom of movement, access to healthcare abroad, voting rights - some fundamental aspects of British life in the EU must be clarified before Brexit happens.A Luxembourg liberal MEP, Charles Goerens, has proposed offering British citizens the option of retaining their EU citizenship for a fee. This ""associate EU citizenship"" idea could be part of the Brexit negotiations but it raises all sorts of legal questions.The EU treaties say EU citizenship ""does not replace national citizenship"" but ""is additional to it"". So EU citizenship cannot be acquired by giving up UK citizenship. Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will lose their EU citizenship. And once Prime Minister Theresa May triggers the Article 50 withdrawal process, which she aims to do before next April, there will be just two years to resolve citizenship issues.Citizens' rights have to be part of the Article 50 negotiations because about 1.2 million UK citizens live in other EU countries and three million EU nationals live in the UK. They need to know what, if any, reciprocal rights they will continue to enjoy after Brexit. Important decisions about jobs, homes, pensions and healthcare could depend on those safeguards.EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to:Beyond those rights, EU law also provides many social protections for EU citizens in the areas of healthcare, work and pensions. An EU citizen can access another EU country's social security system, provided he or she has paid social insurance back home. An example is the EHIC health card - a passport to emergency treatment abroad.The reciprocal rights are called ""EU social security coordination"". The rules are complex, as social provision varies greatly from country to country.Mr Goerens proposes that UK citizens could pay an annual, individual membership fee directly into the EU budget to retain their EU citizenship after Brexit. He did not suggest any figure for that fee. An associate citizen would retain freedom of movement in the EU, the right to reside in another EU country under existing rules and the right to vote in European elections.The European Parliament will vote on the proposal next month - it is Amendment 882 in a long report on possible future EU treaty changes. It has generated much interest on social media and Mr Goerens says many British MEPs have expressed support.But even if MEPs back the proposal, it still has a long way to go. Brexit: All you need to knowBrexit court defeat for UK governmentWould Brexit violate UK citizens' rights?The need for treaty change makes this initiative very hard to achieve by the likely 2019 deadline for Brexit. It could only become law after a treaty change because it would change the nature of EU citizenship. But aggrieved pro-EU Britons may welcome the fact that Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt has backed the proposal. Mr Verhofstadt, an influential liberal, will be the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.EU leaders will inevitably have to change the treaties in the next few years because the UK's role will have to be deleted or amended in EU texts. However, a change to the nature of EU citizenship would require full ratification by all 28 member states - and that could not be done quickly, Prof Catherine Barnard, an expert on EU law, told the BBC.But the proposal, she said, at least showed a willingness in the EU to ""find creative ways to help the 48% who voted to Remain [in the EU]"". Camino Mortera-Martinez, an EU justice expert at the Centre for European Reform, said there was ""no appetite for treaty change in Brussels at the moment"". Next year politicians in the Netherlands, France and Germany will focus on general elections. They will want to avoid EU treaty changes, which are notoriously time-consuming and difficult. It took nearly nine years to draft and enact the Lisbon Treaty.Empowering MEPs to continue representing some UK citizens after Brexit would be another big legal hurdle.Prof Barnard questioned how an MEP could represent an area where ""half the constituents are not even associate EU citizens"". ""That is a non-starter,"" she said. If British ""associate EU citizens"" were to have continued freedom of movement, the UK would have to offer the EU something in return, both experts argue.But that is very problematic. The Brexit vote on 23 June made curbing immigration from the EU a top priority for Mrs May's government. Freedom of movement will be one of the thorniest issues.It would also be hard to get agreement on a fee for EU citizenship, Prof Barnard said. For example Spain, hosting many elderly Britons who use its healthcare system, might demand a high fee. If it took the form of a new EU tax, it would require extra bureaucrats to collect and allocate the income.The European Court of Justice would have to oversee associate citizenship - another thorny issue, because the whole idea of Brexit is for the UK to ""take back control"". So how could an EU court retain jurisdiction over UK citizens?And it could be discriminatory to offer associate EU citizenship only to UK citizens. Many Serbs and Turks might also demand it, as they would like to join the EU. "

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The funding for roads is said to be part of a wider package of pledges for infrastructure projects, amounting to billions of pounds.The Treasury said Mr Hammond and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had ""identified the importance of prioritising projects which make an immediate impact"".Their plans were ""likely to make a real difference by making journeys quicker and easier for millions of commuters"", added a spokesman.The roads investment will include £220m to tackle ""pinch-points"" on Highways England roads.There will also be £27m of funding for an expressway connecting Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge, following the National Infrastructure Commission's recommendation to back the project. What is the Autumn Statement?Financial upheaval ahead for familiesDear Mr Hammond...Mr Hammond is expected to take a different approach to the Autumn Statement than his predecessor George Osborne, by announcing top-level spending decisions rather than full details of individual projects. ""He believes the Treasury should be focused on its core job of economic policy, managing the public finances, and not doing spending departments' jobs for them,"" the spokesman said.The Treasury also said the Autumn Statement would provide ""targeted help to ordinary working families who are struggling to get by"".Mr Hammond is also set to adopt a more flexible approach to the deficit amid economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hammond said he would not leave the burden of debt to future generations and would maintain the flexibility to deal with the uncertainty during the Brexit negotiations. He added: ""My first Autumn Statement will set out a plan for guiding our economy through this period, and preparing it for the future after we leave the EU... We need to step up a gear.""We need to raise the overall productivity of the economy to the level of the best by investing in the infrastructure, the R&D, the skills and the innovation that will enable us not just to survive, but to prosper on the world stage.""However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government ""has not been meeting its own promises"" on infrastructure schemes in the past.A £15bn road-building programme was announced by the coalition government in 2014 but many of the projects are yet to be implemented.In an article in the Observer, Mr McDonnell urged Mr Hammond to help people who will be affected as prices rise following the Brexit vote.""The chancellor can start by introducing a real living wage. He needs to provide honest solutions to the childcare crisis, he said.""Furthermore, he should reverse the giveaways to the wealthy and reverse those cuts, such as universal credit and employment and support allowance, to low and middle earners.""Meanwhile, politicians in northern England are calling on Mr Hammond to prioritise ""northern powerhouse rail"" over London's Crossrail 2 in the Autumn Statement.Greater Manchester mayoral candidate Andy Burnham is among Labour figures warning the chancellor that northern motorways are reaching ""saturation point"" and train capacity is ""at the limit""."

It comes as other senior Tories are urging the PM to drop an appeal against a ruling that MPs must vote on Brexit before the process can begin.The group of 60 Tories - out of a total of 328 Conservative MPs - want Britain to pull out of both the European single market and the customs union, which allows its members to trade without tariffs but imposes common duties on goods imported from outside the bloc.Ms Fernandes said the 23 June vote to leave the EU had been ""an instruction to untie ourselves from EU shackles and freely embrace the rest of the world"".""As was made clear in the referendum campaign, remaining in the EU's internal market like Norway, or in a customs union like Turkey, is not compatible with either of these commitments and doing so would frustrate the will of the electorate.""A government spokeswoman said it was committed to getting a unique deal for Britain, ""not an 'off the shelf' solution"".She said: ""The government is painstakingly analysing the challenges and opportunities for all the different sectors of our economy.""The prime minister has been clear that she wants UK companies to have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market - and to let European businesses do the same here.""Beyond that, it's not in the UK's interest to give a running commentary on our thinking that could undermine our negotiating position.""Meanwhile, Sir Oliver Letwin, former head of the government's Brexit preparations, and two former law officers said the appeal against a court ruling that means MPs must vote on the UK leaving the EU should not go to the Supreme Court.Instead, they want ministers to bring a bill to Parliament to start the process of Brexit as soon as possible.Former minister Sir Oliver told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Supreme Court hearing could see ministers' powers outside Parliament curbed.He said that bringing a bill to Parliament would give the government the ability to trigger Brexit without any constraints on its negotiating power.Former Solicitor General Sir Edward Garnier said Mrs May should drop the appeal to avoid expense and a row about judges' powers, while former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he could not see the point of continuing with the case.The government said it would robustly defend its position at the appeal and said: ""As the prime minister made clear [on Friday], our work is on track and we remain committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year.""A final judgement from the Supreme Court is not expected until January."

""They have been given a three-month window to come up with what in some cases will be multiple millions of pounds.""The Eclipse partnership lost a Supreme Court appeal earlier this year over its use of tax breaks introduced by the government in 1997 to encourage investment in the film industry.Now HMRC is demanding that investors repay their original investment many times over, because of the way the scheme was designed.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said that to make a £1m investment, an Eclipse partner might contribute only £20,000 of their own money and borrow the rest.""The tax relief on the whole amount would have been up to £400,000, or 20 times what they had risked. Here, HRMC may seek to recover the full £400,000,"" he said.Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the all-party group on responsible taxation, said HMRC was right to pursue investors.""If somebody cheats the benefit system, they have to pay the money back and are named and shamed. If somebody cheats the tax system, they should be treated in exactly the same way,"" she said."

Or do we take what might be the more difficult approach - to restore hope?""We can see the choice being taken by politicians on the hard right - to whip up division against migrants, Muslims, Mexicans, women, LGBT people, people with disabilities.""The fake anti-elitism of rich, white men - like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump - is farcical at one level, but in reality it's no joke at all.""We've seen a similar phenomenon in the US since last week's presidential election as we saw after Brexit: an appalling rise in hate crime.""Saying anything to win a vote has consequences on the ground afterwards.""Mr Farage campaigned alongside Mr Trump in the race for the White House and was the first politician from the UK to meet the president-elect after his election victory.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentJeremy Corbyn's message was clear. If you have lost trust in politicians, well, don't go for fake anti-elitism. Go for the real thing. Him.But in order to distance himself from conventional parliamentarians he renewed his attack on the pre-Corbyn Labour leadership which, he said, had become too complacent about inequality.  He now wants his National Policy Forum to turn the pledges he made in his leadership campaign in to detailed policy.But while the broad anti-austerity thrust of his message is unlikely to be challenged, he may find the policy forum won't simply rubber stamp all of his ideas.In an internal election for that body's vice-chair, the left-wing candidate closest to his own views was roundly defeated.And a potential showdown with critics over future leadership rules has been put on hold as his team believe an early general election is likely.But Mr Corbyn said it was ""down to Labour to restore hope - and give people the chance to take back real control"", echoing the slogan of the EU referendum's Leave campaign.He said the Tories had ""fanned the flames of fear over immigration, whipping up hatred in the referendum campaign - egged on by their UKIP sidekicks"".Rejecting some Labour MPs' calls to commit to net migration targets, Mr Corbyn said: ""We have to choose a different path; there can be no accommodation, now and never, with hate.""We will not make false promises on immigration targets as the Tories have done or sow divisions, but we will take decisive action to end the undercutting of workers' pay and conditions, reinstate the Migrant Impact Fund to support public services, and back fair rules on migration."""

The UKIP leader has been mentioned as a possible ""go-between"" between the UK and US President-elect Donald Trump because of their friendship. And speculation grew he could secure the role and a place in the House of Lords when Prime Minister Theresa May refused to deny talks had taken place. But Mr Farage said ""it's not going to happen"", at least in the near future. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, he said there was more chance of him going into the jungle on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here than becoming a member of the House of Lords.When asked if he would accept a peerage, the MEP said: ""A) it's not going to happen and B) it's not what I want in my life at this moment in time.""When I'm old, you know, I might think about it.""Mr Farage was the first politician from the UK to meet with President-elect Trump after his surprise victory in last week's US election. He campaigned alongside Mr Trump in the race for the White House and said the businessman was willing to be ""very close partners"" with the UK.The incoming US president has spoken to Mrs May by phone and there have been other contacts between ministers and representatives of the incoming administration.Mrs May declined to rule out the idea of a peerage for Mr Farage when it was put to her during Prime Minister's Questions.SNP MP George Kerevan asked Mrs May whether there had been any ""official conversations"" about giving Mr Farage a peerage.As MPs laughed at the question, the prime minister replied: ""All I can say to him, I'm afraid, is that such matters are normally never discussed in public."""
2016-11-19,MP's boundary bill clears first hurdle,https://web.archive.org//web/20161120051832/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38025403,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA bid to stop plans that would cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 has cleared its first Commons hurdle.Labour MP Pat Glass's bill, which aims to retain the current number of MPs at 650, was backed by 253 votes to 37.But Tory David Nuttall accused some Labour MPs of opposing the plans because they feared being replaced by pro-Corbyn Momentum candidates.New government-backed boundary proposals would see fewer MPs and create equal-sized seats.Ms Glass's bid to retain the status quo of 650 MPs secured a second reading and will now proceed to committee stage. However, it is unlikely to become law without the support of the government.The changes proposed by the Boundary Commissions for England and Wales would ensure each constituency - with the exception of a few island seats - has a broadly similar population, but the moves are opposed by some Conservative and Labour MPs.Labour fears it will lose the most seats under the plans, intended to be introduced in time for a general election in 2020, which would ensure the number of people entitled to vote in each constituency is within 5% of 74,769.Ms Glass's Parliamentary Constituencies (Amendment) Bill aims to ensure constituencies are within 10% of the electoral quota, that the boundary commissions use more up-to-date data, and that reviews take place every 10 years, rather than five.In the Commons, Ms Glass told MPs her bill was not motivated by self-interest as she intends to stand down from her North West Durham constituency at the next general election.She argued that with the rise of anti-establishment politics and the emergence of far-right parties, MPs needed to reach out and engage with voters now more than ever.'Bigger than ourselves'By cutting the number of MPs and making their constituencies bigger and more remote, ministers endanger the current ""MP-constituency link which is envied in democracies across the world"", she said.But Conservative MP Mr Nuttall stepped in to argue: ""Isn't it the case the reason why this bill has been brought forward is that there are so many members on the benches opposite who are frightened of re-selection because of the threat of Momentum taking their seats?""That's the real reason why this bill has been brought forward.""Labour's Jess Phillips could be heard saying: ""Unlike you, we're not scared of democracy.""And Ms Glass told Mr Nuttall: ""I think that the unfortunate intervention is not helpful and just exemplifies why people out there get so angry about people in here.""This is about something bigger than ourselves.""'An opportunity?'But Tory former chief whip Mark Harper was critical of colleagues who opposed the planned reduction in their numbers. ""Listening to some MPs talk about the constituencies they currently represent, they do sound like they think they own them,"" he said.Momentum is a grassroots organisation set up to provide support for Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, following his election in 2015.His leadership was hit by a wave of resignations from his front bench in the aftermath of UK voting to leave the European Union in June, but he was re-elected party leader in September by an increased margin, with strong backing from party members.In September, Darren Williams - a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - suggested the overhaul of constituency boundaries may present ""an opportunity"" to force out MPs who have been ""consistently"" disloyal to leader Mr Corbyn."

The Counsel General for Wales will make arguments about the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law.The Supreme Court hearing is expected to start on 5 December and last four days, with the decision expected in the new year.AnalysisTom Bateman, BBC political correspondentThe government has been clear in its belief that the referendum result gives it the authority to use its executive powers to trigger the EU exit process. But the Scottish government believes this is unlawful, claiming that invoking Article 50 would involve a ""fundamental alteration"" in the UK's constitutional arrangements and the rights of Scottish people - who voted to remain in the EU - about which the Hollyrood parliament should be consulted. It is far from clear how much legal weight these arguments will carry in this complex constitutional case in front of 11 Supreme Court judges. But the politics are easier to predict: If the government's appeal fails, Parliament is likely to become the next battleground over the timing and - potentially - the terms of Brexit.It is a fight Downing Street is desperate to avoid - amid the increasingly toxic atmosphere between those tussling for control of Britain's departure from the EU.A government spokesman said it was ""a matter for the Supreme Court which applications to intervene are accepted"".""The UK government's position remains the same, and we will be taking strong legal arguments to court next month,"" he said.Scotland's Brexit minister Michael Russell welcomed the decision, but added: ""We continue to call on the UK government to drop the appeal and to accept that Parliament has the right to determine the triggering of Article 50. ""We recognise the decision of people in England and Wales to support Brexit, but the views of people in Scotland cannot simply be brushed aside.""The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which describes itself as ""fighting for the rights and welfare of some of the most vulnerable and under-represented workers in the UK"", has also been given permission to make submissions to the Supreme Court.The Attorney General for Northern Ireland has made a reference to the court on devolution issues and did not need permission to intervene. Separately another Brexit case brought by victims' campaigner Raymond McCord in Belfast has also been referred to the Supreme Court.Earlier this month three High Court judges ruled that the prime minister did not have the power to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start the two-year process of negotiating Brexit, without the prior authority of Parliament. Mrs May and her ministers are now asking the Supreme Court to overturn that unanimous decision.Labour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process if a vote goes ahead.But Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has said his party will vote against triggering Article 50, unless they are promised a second referendum on the UK's Brexit deal with EU leaders. Some Labour MPs have said they are also willing to oppose it.Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, believes that the consent of the Scottish Parliament and the UK's other devolved parliaments and assemblies should also be sought before Article 50 is triggered.Mick Antoniw AM, Counsel General for Wales, said previously: ""This case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution."" The legal challenge over Brexit was brought by investment fund manager and philanthropist Gina Miller, along with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.After Lord Toulson's retirement this summer, the appeal will be heard by all 11 remaining Supreme Court justices, led by their President Lord Neuberger."

Do the decent thing. Give our people the right to stay,"" she will say.Prof Ottoline Leyser, representing the Royal Society, told the committee there were 31,000 non-UK EU citizens working in research in academia in the UK.She said she believed that these people were ""all feeling very anxious and unwelcome"". ""There has been a lot of discussion about non-UK EU nationals currently working in the UK and what guarantees can be provided to them.""I think it is absolutely not the way we should be proceeding - to use people's lives as bargaining chips in a broader political landscape. ""I do not think that is a constructive way to arrive at a negotiation table either.""In its report on implications for science and research following the vote to leave the EU, the committee called for ""an immediate commitment to exempt them [EU researchers working in the UK] from Brexit negotiations on any reciprocal immigration controls for workers already in post.""It also cited evidence stressing the importance of Britain being able ""to recruit and retain the very best scientists, whatever country they come from"".Professor Philip Nelson of Research Councils UK told the committee: ""the biggest risks to the research base in the UK are around the people involved"".The committee said it had received written examples of researchers considering rejecting UK job offers because of the uncertainty around the EU referendum result.It said that Dr Sarah Main of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE) effectively summarised much of their evidence.She said: ""It is not really a question of us allowing talented scientists and engineers to come here; it is about us fighting for them to come here. ""'There is an international competitive market for these fantastically talented people.""She added that she felt the government should clearly state its priorities ""for the place of science in our future"" and ""how it feels about the people that it wants to come here"".""UK science is not done by UK nationals. It is done by many people,"" she added.University vice-chancellors mirrored this claim saying it was essential that staff and students from across the world can come to the UK without unnecessary administrative burdens. University UK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: ""We also support the report's recommendation to appoint a chief scientific adviser to the Department for Exiting the EU. This would help to ensure that the significant implications of leaving the EU for science and research were adequately reflected in the government's post-exit plans.""Universities and Science Minister Jo Johnson said: ""We intend to secure the best possible outcome for our research base as we exit the European Union. The excellence of our research and the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do it are fundamental to our continued success.""Our international relationships make us a global centre of excellence.""Shortly after the EU referendum result in June, the government gave a guarantee that students currently in higher or further education - and those applying for a place this academic year (2016-17) - would continue to be able to access student funding support.And in October this guarantee was extended to students wishing to study in the UK next year."

On Friday he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mrs May, French President Francois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy in Berlin.The White House said Mr Obama had ""affirmed the importance of continued cooperation through multilateral institutions, including Nato"" and ""agreed on the necessity of working collectively to move the transatlantic agenda forward, particularly on bringing stabilisation to the Middle East and North Africa, as well as securing diplomatic resolution to the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine.On Brexit, Mrs May said: ""Our work is on track, we do stand ready to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017.""I want to see this as a smooth process, an orderly process, working towards a solution that is in the interests of both the UK but also in the interests of our European partners too.""The meeting comes as German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble told the Financial Times the UK may have to continue paying into EU budgets for more than a decade after it leaves the union.He said Britain will ""certainly have to fulfil its commitments"" to the EU until its departure - and possibly after.He added: ""Possibly there will be some commitments that last beyond the exit… even, in part, to 2030."""

2016-11-19,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161120051832/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

So what's the story behind Breitbart?Just days after the US election, an ebullient Nigel Farage made his way to Trump Tower in New York - the first British politician to meet the president-elect.""We're just tourists!"" Farage joked to waiting reporters.By his side was his former aide and the London editor of Breitbart News, Raheem Kassam. And Kassam's ultimate boss, Stephen Bannon, has been lined up for a top White House job as Trump's chief strategist.Key figures at Breitbart News - a fast-growing conservative website that has been condemned by some commentators as racist and misogynist - are connected with both the Trump campaign and with the UK Independence Party. The White House was probably a distant dream when conservative entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart launched Breitbart.tv in 2007. It built on his earlier work for online outlets such as the conservative Drudge Report and liberal Huffington Post, along with an early iteration of his eponymous site which collected news links.The site first gained notoriety with videos targeting liberal groups and politicians. In 2011, it scored a major scoop when it exposed former Democratic congressman Anthony Wiener's sexting scandal.In 2012, Andrew Breitbart died of heart failure. Bannon became executive chairman.""The site used to be a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred conservative website that held liberals to account and resisted political correctness,"" says Jesse Singal, a writer-at-large with New York Magazine who's tussled with Breitbart in the past. ""They've turned much more extreme since Andrew Breitbart died.""From its base in California, the site has expanded, opening bureaus in Texas, Jerusalem and, in 2014, London. ""We look at London and Texas as two fronts in our current cultural and political war,"" Bannon said at the time.At the outset of the marathon US election campaign, the site initially seemed to back Texas Senator Ted Cruz.But a key moment came in March when Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, Trump's then campaign manager. Charges were filed but later dropped. After Fields was criticised - and Lewandowski defended - by some of her Breitbart colleagues, there were several resignations from the website.In August, Bannon was picked to lead Trump's campaign. It was a sign of the site's influence. Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart reporter whose beat was the Hillary Clinton campaign, says the site doesn't pretend to balance all sides of an issue.""The ethic of objectivity as it's traditionally formulated is not practised there,"" he says. However he defends the spin by saying the site is up-front about it. ""I never made any pretence about the fact that I did not want Hillary Clinton to be president.""Future expansion targets include France and Germany. ""Their model is to identify areas where there are two ingredients, the potential to exploit or inflame racial anxieties, anti-Muslim sentiment, anti-feminist sentiment,"" says Angelo Carusone, executive vice president of the left-wing think tank Media Matters. He predicts they will back the National Front in France. ""The second ingredient is a political opposition force that they can align with or consume to gain legitimacy.""In Britain, Carusone says, UKIP was that force.2007: Andrew Breitbart starts Breitbart.tv2011: Breitbart breaks the story of Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner's sex scandal2012: Andrew Breitbart dies; Stephen Bannon takes over as executive chairman2014: Breitbart opens a bureau in LondonMarch 2016: Trump's then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabs Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields at a rally. The resultant controversy leads several reporters and editors to resignAugust 2016: Bannon appointed Trump campaign chief executiveOctober 2016: Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam launches a bid for the UKIP leadership using the slogan ""Make UKIP Great Again"". He later withdraws13 November 2016: Following the election, Bannon is picked to be Trump's chief strategistIn the days since the election and Bannon's appointment, there's been a lot of coverage about the site's most provocative content, including a set of much-discussed headlines: This however is just one slice of Breitbart's output, which is a hodgepodge of factual stories provided by news wires, provocative opinion designed to infuriate liberals and whip up conservatives, cheerleading for Trump and right-wing ideas, and attack pieces on celebrities, journalists and other perceived enemies. The company produces videos, movies, radio shows and podcasts and has a huge social media presence.It's all presented in a tabloid style - and the site has no clear delineations between news, analysis, commentary and opinion. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Kassam described the site's style: ""Is it ugly? Yes. Is it varnished? No. But is it truthful? Absolutely.""Howley says the site's approach is straightforward. ""We are honest about it,"" he says. ""If you suspend objectivity you can build great sources and develop an audience and the information is all the same.""Howley, who says there is no written code of ethics or guidelines for Breitbart journalists, argues the site tapped into the ""populist side of the conservative movement which wasn't really represented in the press"". He resigned from Breitbart on election night, saying that the company had grown and changed substantially in his time there and that he was interested in other reporting projects.Editor-at-large Joel Pollak has denied the site is racist or sexist. The staff are ""happy warriors"", Pollak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Andrew Breitbart founded it to take on the mainstream media, to take on the institutional left and to take on the Republican Party establishment. There is in a sense a populist undercurrent in the website but that's not angry."" Over the last 18 months, Breitbart's fortunes have risen in line with Trump's. According to web analytics company Comscore, the site has added millions of readers since Donald Trump started his run to the presidency. Its monthly US audience is now more than 19 million, which puts it ahead of many mainstream news sites.In Britain it has a much narrower reach, even factoring in the UK's smaller population - Comscore puts its monthly unique users at under 700,000.If you visit the site and click around, you're just as likely to find straight news (""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on 'the twin interests of peace and security'"") as you are to see freewheeling pro-Trump hype (""It happened. We won! We now live in the Age of Daddy!"")In that respect, Breitbart is distinct from the ""fake news"" industry that received so much attention after the election. Critics note that its stories might be made up of facts, but spun and deployed hard against its main bugbears - including liberals, refugees (particularly from the Muslim world), and feminism. In August, the site published a story headlined ""TB spiked 500 percent in Twin Falls during 2012, as Chobani Yoghurt opened plant"".The story was one of several the site ran about a small city in Idaho and Chobani, one of America's leading yogurt brands. Chobani is owned by Hamdi Ulukaya, a billionaire immigrant from Turkey. Ulukaya has ties to President Obama and has employed refugees at his plants in Idaho and elsewhere.The story linked a rise in tuberculosis cases to the yogurt plant and refugees living locally.But there was more to the story. The ""500 percent"" spike in the headline represented an increase from one case - to six. Those six cases, according to Tom Shanahan of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, were all diagnosed prior to the Chobani plant opening in December 2012.By 2015, the number of cases was back down to just one. Shanahan says that the Breitbart story was ""misleading"", that the tuberculosis spike was not statistically significant and that it could not be linked to the yogurt plant or refugees in the area. In the UK, following the EU referendum in June, several stories on the site poked holes in a reports which suggested that hate crimes had spiked by 57%.The cause and effect around current events and hate crimes is complicated and awareness of how to report them boosts statistics. However there was no mention on Breitbart of later analysis by the Home Office which showed a 41% rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote. ""It's a more radical Fox News. It's living in a different world, a much more fearful world, where rumour and innuendo are passed around as fact,"" says Singal. Breitbart also runs sharply critical stories on other journalists and news outlets and mocks reporters who complain about trolls and slurs. ""Every special snowflake reporter with a Twitter account wanted in on the sweet victimhood action,"" taunted one writer, criticising journalists who found themselves being shouted at by Trump supporters at campaign rallies.Mainstream media reporters who have been the subject of Breitbart pieces have at times found themselves on the receiving end of online trolling. The BBC has spoken to several who have had rape and death threats against themselves and their families, and several from news outlets in the US and the UK said they or their colleagues have been cautious about writing about the site for fear of the resultant backlash.There's no implication that Breitbart reporters or employees are directing the trolling or participating in it themselves. (Although one Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, was banned from Twitter for firing off unpleasant messages to actress Leslie Jones.) And Breitbart is far from the only news source to whip its audience into action. At the same time the company and its journalists don't hesitate to complain about alleged abuse against themselves.Stephen Bannon: Breitbart's executive chairman, he left to run the Trump campaign and has been lined up for a job as senior strategist in the Trump White House. In a rare speech in 2014, he had words of praise for UKIPNigel Farage: The UKIP leader is a regular Breitbart columnistRaheem Kassam: Hired by Bannon to be Breitbart's London editor, he was a chief adviser to Farage during the 2015 general election, and briefly ran for UKIP leader himself before dropping outRobert Mercer: A Breitbart funder and investor in Cambridge Analytica, the data firm used by EU referendum Leave campaigners and the Trump campaign. His daughter, Rebekah Mercer, is part of Trump's transition teamArron Banks: This major UKIP donor backed Kassam's leadership bid and bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign, enlisting the help of Cambridge AnalyticaRaheem Kassam, the site's London editor, made a brief run for UKIP leader. After dropping out of the race, Kassam said he would pursue a harassment case against journalists from the Times, claiming they intimidated his parents in the course of writing a profile on him. The Times characterised the encounter as a ""short, polite conversation with a family member"" in the course of ""standard reporting practice"".The site, which frequently argues in favour of free speech, has vowed to sue an unnamed media outlet for calling it a ""white nationalist"" website. Thus far, no legal action has commenced. Breitbart's funding sources are somewhat obscure. As a private company, Breitbart has declined to reveal its investors or how it makes money. In 2014, before its overseas expansion, Bannon said that the site wasn't quite profitable. There are ads on the site and it also sells merchandise such as campaign coffee cups.It has been reported that the company has been funded by Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund manager who is the founder of Cambridge Analytica, a data firm which worked for the Leave.EU campaign as well as Trump's bid for the White House.  Mercer's daughter Rebekah is part of Trump's transition team. Another big Leave.EU backer was UKIP donor Arron Banks, who accompanied Farage and Kassam to Trump Tower. In Washington, the big question people have been asking about Bannon is how he will act in the Trump administration, and what the role of Breitbart will be once he's there. Prior to the election, Bannon said he would return to the company - but that was before Trump's victory and his White House appointment. Under ethics rules, Bannon has 30 days from taking office in January to declare his financial ties to Breitbart.Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who resigned after the Fields incident, says in his view the site's function won't change when Trump becomes president.""It will be the propaganda arm of the administration,"" he says. ""Their mandate is to create conflict, controversy and divisiveness - as well as propping up President Trump,"" he says. But conservative journalist Cathy Young, who clashed with Breitbart after denouncing what she saw as the site's whitewashing of the extremist alt-right, argues that those might take a back seat to a more pragmatic political style.""My guess would be that Bannon will be less of a champion of the alt-right than a political pit bull who will use whatever weapon he can to pursue the victory of the person he's promoting.""For his part, Farage has offered to act as a conduit between the US and the UK - a proposal that Downing Street quickly rebuffed.  Breitbart did not respond to requests to comment for this story, and several reporters and staff members also did not respond to questions. Carusone, from Media Matters, thinks that calling Breitbart ""propaganda"" slightly misstates its role, and says its real function in a Trump White House could be to shore up support on the far right. ""There's been a consensus in some parts of the media that Trump is softening on some of his policies,"" he says. ""Part of the role of Breitbart will be to give a wink and a nod to Trump's most fervent supporters to let them know he's still on their side.""Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter"

While recent data has shown a robust economy, a slowdown in growth is being forecast for next year.Uncertainty over Brexit has weakened the pound, which has been great for exporters but has made imported goods and raw materials more expensive.The BBC has been speaking to businesses from across the UK, finding out how their bosses are feeling and what they would like to see from the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, 23 November.In Scunthorpe Shay Eddy, the managing director of SC4 Steel which supplies the construction industry, is feeling optimistic.""We're certainly in a better position than we were 12 months ago.""We invested at the bottom of the cycle, we ordered a new machine that's just been commissioned now. We've just committed to another machine and we're looking at expanding and exporting starting January next year.""But like other businesses, he wants to know more about the UK's future relationship with Europe.""More clarity would be ideal because uncertainty is no good for anybody, but we can't expect the government to tip their hand as to what they are going to be negotiating with,"" he says.Norbar Torque Tools, based in Banbury, is one of Oxfordshire's best known exporters. As 35% of its sales go to mainland Europe the firm is closely watching the Brexit debate.""The single most important thing for exporting companies like us is that the government negotiates access to the single market on favourable terms,"" says commercial director Catherine Rohl.She is also worried about the supply of skilled workers. ""It is a concern, particularly here in Banbury where unemployment is very low. And if it is going to be more difficult to recruit from across the EU in future, then that becomes even more difficult.""She says the chancellor can help with that with more support for training, education and apprenticeships in science and engineering subjects.Nick Grey is the founder and chief executive of Gtech, a Worcester-based firm that makes cordless vacuum cleaners and garden tools.He would like the chancellor to support research and development by extending tax breaks for investment in R&D.""It's a good incentive, it's reasonably generous. Don't take it away definitely, and a bit more would be welcome,"" he says.In South Wales construction giant Costain is working on a £200m road project that involves building 16 structures, 12km (7.5 miles) of retaining walls and moving 2.5 million tonnes of soil and rocks.Bruce Richards, who is managing the project, says that 70% of the contracts involved have been awarded to firms in South Wales, creating 180 jobs in the process.""We believe the government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure. We hope in the Autumn Statement that way of thinking will continue,"" he says.Northern Ireland was one of the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis, with around a third of all jobs in the construction industry lost after 2008. ""The construction sector in Northern Ireland was very dramatically hit by the recession. I'm pleased to say now that we're starting to see a more fragile recovery,"" says Ray Hutchinson, managing director of Gilbert Ash, a construction firm that is building a new Marriott Hotel in Belfast. However, his company is focusing on the south-east of England where growth is stronger.Mr Ash says that ""a number"" of projects have been paused as clients weigh up the implications of Brexit.""We will be looking to the chancellor to increase spending on infrastructure,"" he says. ""Certainly that could have a very dramatic economic stimulus on the entire economy in the UK."""
2016-11-19,Give and take,https://web.archive.org//web/20161120051832/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38013591,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA class of Ugandan schoolgirls lines up under a tree. They are waiting to receive the HPV vaccine, which will protect them from cervical cancer. The project is run by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which in turn has received a significant amount of funding from British taxpayers. With a budget of more than £12bn, the Department for International Development is an arm of government with spending power that is likely to keep growing. The UK has passed a bill that enshrines in law its commitment to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on aid every year.  But that commitment, while welcomed by some as a mark of British generosity, is dismissed by others as a licence to spend money on projects of dubious value. The Conservative MP and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell is a staunch defender.""There is massive need, we can see it in the world today, huge discrepancies of opportunity, deep, deep poverty,"" he says. ""The British development budget is addressing these colossal discrepancies, and it does so extremely effectively."" The current Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, once advocated scrapping the department she now leads. And since taking up the role, she has stressed that it is in Britain's ""national interest"" to invest across the world, to alleviate poverty and suffering. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in September, Ms Patel said: ""Our aid programme forms a crucial part of Britain's soft power around the world. ""When people in refugee camps or remote communities see the Union Jack displayed proudly on our emergency supplies, they know they have a friend and an ally in Britain."" Some believe that world view may be given extra impetus by the need to forge trade deals, in the wake of Brexit. But Kirsty McNeill, executive director of policy and campaigns at Save the Children, says we should give because we can.""If I saw a drowning man in the Thames on the way home tonight and I saved him, it may well do wonders for my reputation, but that's not why I do it - I do it because if you can save a life, you should save a life,"" she says. Jonathan Foreman, author of Aiding and Abetting: Foreign Aid Failures and the 0.7% Deception, takes a far more sceptical view.He says that far from being good for the national image, if money is handed over to people in a country who are known to be powerful and corrupt, it can be very damaging.""People in those countries think you must have known it was a corrupt country, you must have known that school was not going to be built, and then they think you are in league with the people whose mis-governance is making this country such an impoverished place,"" he says. There are other pitfalls too.Owen Barder, from the Centre for Global Development think tank, says: ""The US and in the past the EU shipped a lot of food aid from our own countries.""It was in the national interest to buy it from our farmers and ship it there, but it was much more expensive. ""Our aid saved many fewer lives, and we drove local farmers and local suppliers out of business."" Given that ""promoting global prosperity"" is among Dfid's priorities, putting local traders out of business is not part of the plan.But Michela Wrong, the author of It's our turn to Eat - which looks at corruption in Kenya, believes there is another problem with the UK's choice of aid partners. She points to countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia and Uganda, which, she says, are not particularly good at promoting democracy and human rights but are successful at building schools and improving maternal health.""Is that model really sustainable?"" she asks.Mr Mitchell accepts this is not ideal but says the aid relationship is not with the governments but with the people. And if you withdraw the aid, ""you're taking girls out of school, or stopping farmers accruing the knowledge to be able to feed themselves and their locality"". One of Ms Patel's priorities is to deliver value for money in aid - but some in the aid world argue it is not always easy to measure outcomes. You may be able to count the number of children that have been given access to a school, but how can you assess the quality of the education they have received? Many of these arguments have been thrashed out in the development world for decades, but Mr Barder says the problems traditionally linked to aid should have an even bigger resonance now because they try to address shared problems.""Like climate change, which we have to tackle together, problems of conflict and insecurity, problems of global health, of inequality and those requiring shared policy solutions, aid is part of the solution,"" says Mr Barder.""The votes we have seen on Brexit and Donald Trump are the people saying to the politicians, 'You are not addressing these problems fast enough and in the way we need.'"" But as electorates reject global trade deals and multinational groupings such as the EU, it may be more difficult than ever to persuade countries to work together. At the same time, the problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability.In Uganda, the plan is to end the support for the vaccination programme by 2020, when it is hoped the country will be wealthier. But for the moment, British taxpayers will continue to help protect the health of Ugandan children.  "
2016-11-19,Statement of intent,https://web.archive.org//web/20161120051832/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38011185,"You may not have noticed it yet, but next week's Autumn Statement will be a big test of the prime minister's seriousness.  Theresa May is making an extraordinary claim - to be the Western leader who gets the zeitgeist, who has the answers others are too timid to grasp, without being so headstrong that she threatens the whole system of world capitalism. The overarching question about the chancellor's first major economic pronouncement will be ""What does it say about Brexit?"".This is entirely right and proper. Philip Hammond wouldn't be in charge of the UK economy without that vote - George Osborne would still be in post. The direction Mr Hammond takes will depend on whether he thinks Britain is more likely to boom or bust outside the European Union. In some quarters, he is already castigated for not sticking to a ""happy clappy"" script.Sensible people agree Brexit is an economic leap in the dark, destination unknown. But to some, acknowledging this is akin to heresy.  Our leap, they insist, will be on to a rainbow from where we will slide gently to a pot of gold.  If Mr Hammond's economic analysis suggests it might be best to brace for a bumpy landing on the rocks below - just in case - some will regard that as defeatist whingeing. We need to look out for growth and tax forecasts and measures to buttress a faltering economy, but tone and presentation will be important too. The shock absorbers he does - or does not - put in place will tell us something about this government's true perception of Brexit, but its ambitions to reshape the British economy are far more significant. It should tell us more about the intention and beliefs of the second most intriguing politician in the world - Mrs May. I would not have dreamed of writing that a few months ago, but as she herself said recently, we live in ""a world transformed"".Of course what she does as prime minister at a critical time for our country is important, but it is much more than that.She appears to be putting herself forward as the first leader in the world who will respond to a wave of populist discontent she neither encouraged nor summoned.  She makes clear her job is to ameliorate a mood that is sweeping the West. Her mission is nothing less than saving globalisation and free trade from themselves. We are familiar with the terms ""centre right"" or ""centre left"". She seems to want ""centre populism"".  This may of course turn out to be traditional conservatism reheated in the rhetoric de jour, or it might be a wholehearted embrace of the radical ideas of the new hard right. Last week I wrote about the similarities between Donald Trump's victory and Brexit. There are many differences between the leader of the UK and the next leader of the US but one in particular is critical.Mr Trump not only skilfully surfed the wave of populism, he summoned the waters, encouraged the swell and used its gathering force to propel himself into power. Here, by contrast, Mrs May was a mere bystander as the flood smashed the existing political order to matchsticks, the would-be surfers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spectacularly wiped out by the waves and David Cameron and Mr Osborne turned into so much flotsam and jetsam. She was picked up and swept along in the tumult and deposited, almost accidently, in a high place, dryish and in charge.Mrs May could have been briskly business-like and insisted the only instruction from the referendum was the simple one on the ballot paper - to leave the EU. ""Brexit means Brexit"" to coin a phrase. But Mrs May agrees with the academics and journalists who say it means far more, that voters were expressing a wider mood of discontent. In her recent speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet she repeated the central tenets of her party conference speech.Brexit was a message about immigration and anger at a rich elite, some of whom ignore the rules others must obey. But above all, she said, politicians and business people had to accept that ""globalisation in its current form has left too many people behind"". And ""we can do much more to ensure the prosperity [globalisation and free trade] provide is shared by all"".Read this out of context and you might guess she is attempting to out-Corbyn Jeremy. Repeating ""prosperity shared by all"" twice in her speech might lead you to believe that ""Red Phil"" will be ordered to use the Autumn Statement to introduce a wealth tax of 90% on incomes of more than £200,000 and big corporate profits, and use the proceeds to treble the minimum wage, quadruple pensions and add a big fat nought to all benefits.This is probably not Mrs May's way of ""sharing prosperity"". So what will she do?Mr Trump wants to bring back jobs by introducing tariffs. That's not Mrs May's way either. Indeed, she wants to be ""the strongest global advocate for free markets and free trade"".So what could bring ""the left behinds"" (TLBs) right up front? Her answer? A new industrial strategy. The test of Mrs May's seriousness will be if this is the centrepiece of the Autumn Statement.The shimmering outlines of what an industrial strategy might be are just about visible - ""backing up the strengths"" of great universities, dynamic businesses, creating ""conditions where winners can emerge"" and ""developing untapped potential"".It's still rather hazy. To convince, Mr Hammond has to come up with spending promises and tax incentives to make this feel like new policy which will substantially change lives.  There are some signs ""the left behinds"" may lose out again to a newer group which has caught the PM's eye - the so-called ""Just about managing"", or Jams. The proposed help for them seems to be more in the nature of headline-grabbing gimmicks than a real change in policy.   If this is all talk, Mrs May is playing a dangerous game with the public mood.She must know she does not have much leeway. Because the President-elect was so brutally frank about his extreme prescriptions on the road to power, he can afford to tone it down a bit now. Donnie Darkmouth can, to an extent, morph into Temperate Trump.  But Mrs May did not originally champion or encourage the people who put her in power. She is calculating what they want, not expressing a shared fury, which means she risks sounding too shrill for those who do not share her prescription, while not doing enough to meet TLB or Jam concerns. There is a danger too in falling in love with what is fast becoming an overwhelming narrative. Whilst ""the left behinds"" is a useful catch-all, I prefer the idea of ""the disconnect"". Politicians will not be serving the national interest if they get the idea that courting former industrial workers undergoing a crisis of identity is all that matters. This government has only revealed itself in fits and starts: long on talk, short on policy. Next week we might see if it will put our money where its mouth is.  "

What does she need to do to keep her backbenchers on side?When she replaced him as prime minister in July, Theresa May also took on David Cameron's small Commons majority, and all the problems that come with it.The government's ""working majority"" - calculated when you take away the non-voting Speaker, deputy speakers and Sinn Fein members, as well as the two seats left vacant by the resignations of Conservatives Zac Goldsmith and Stephen Phillips - is just 14, meaning the prime minister needs to work extra hard to ensure her MPs back her, and her policies.If Labour, the SNP and other smaller parties work together on an issue, they need only to attract a handful of unhappy Conservatives - seven - to their side and the government risks defeat.Mrs May is widely regarded as one of the more ""unclubbable"" politicians, admitting when running for leadership of the Conservative party that she did not ""go drinking in Parliament's bars"" and preferred to get ""on with the job"".That has put her at a disadvantage, says The Spectator's Katy Balls, because she does not have a ready-made network of supporters.""Unlike George Osborne, who was constantly meeting with MPs and having drinks parties, Theresa May has never really courted her party like that,"" she says. ""They need a bit more TLC almost, to stay behaved. They're not getting that, which allows them to go a bit more rogue.""The single biggest issue on the prime minister's agenda is Brexit and, whether she likes it or not, it is likely to define her entire premiership.The government has been locked in a battle in the High Court against a ruling on triggering Article 50, the formal notification of leaving the EU. If the appeal in the Supreme Court fails and Mrs May is instead required to bring forward legislation in the Commons to trigger Brexit talks, she can expect to win the backing of her MPs. Labour will also vote in favour, though a handful of their MPs and some from smaller parties have told the BBC they will vote against.Former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who was a vocal Remain supporter during the campaign, has warned against the government's reluctance to allow Parliament to delve into the detail, arguing that a vote on Brexit would ""strengthen Theresa May's hand"".Another of her MPs has warned that the prime minister must not forget she has to take her MPs with her.Heidi Allen, whose maiden speech attacked the government's policy on tax credit cuts, says Mrs May is absolutely determined to deliver Brexit because that is what the British people want.""My sense is just that Theresa is an almost civil servant-like politician. She believes that she's got a job to do and nothing should stand in her way.""I think that it's her determination that's making her perhaps a little single-minded.""Former cabinet minister Peter Lilley is a veteran of the battles in the Conservative Party over Europe in the 1990s, which saw an organised rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty erode John Major's majority and turn him into a leader widely seen as lacking authority within his own party.Although Conservative MPs were broadly split over Leave and Remain before the referendum, Mr Lilley thinks most of them want to now make Brexit work.""They're relieved that the initial reaction of the economy has entirely wrong-footed the doom-mongers in the Treasury and the Bank of England,"" he says.""There's a feeling of pretty good unanimity. The vast majority of those who supported remain want to make a success of it.""Mrs May's political life is not all about Brexit.There has been disquiet over issues such as opening new grammar schools and welfare changes. Some are not happy over the ""trashing"" of David Cameron's legacy. So can the prime minister rely on that slim majority to hold?Ms Allen certainly thinks rebellion is a good thing, when well used.""We have a lot if independent-minded MPs,"" she says. ""We came here to make a difference, not just toe the party line.""Ms Soubry says she was heartened by the prime minister's first speech, delivered on the day she took over from Mr Cameron. Mrs May spoke of leading a government ""driven not by the interests of the privileged few"" and promised to make Britain ""a country that works for everyone"".However, Ms Soubry warns that her actions need to match her words.""If there's any disquiet, it's that Theresa needs now to be true now to the words, the sentiment, the admirable goals and her dream and vision of our country. She's now got to be true to what she said on the steps of Downing Street."""
2016-11-19,Is Boris bored?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161120051832/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38014012,"Boris Johnson is one of those few politicians whose notoriety gives their utterances a wider audience than Westminster. It is why he was such an effective advocate for Leave during the referendum. And it is why the prime minister will use him to sell the Brexit deal when eventually it is struck. So it will have come as no surprise to Mr Johnson to have attracted the attention this week of the actor Ewan McGregor - even if he might not have appreciated why. The star of Trainspotting and Star Wars, who has one million Twitter followers, used his social media account to criticise the foreign secretary for offering ""an impossible Brexit vision"". The cause of Mr McGregor's ire was Mr Johnson's interview with a Czech newspaper in which he suggested the UK might leave the EU customs union. This might not sound too controversial until you realise that doing that after Brexit is not actually government policy. Downing Street has deliberately kept its options open, leading some MPs to think that staying in the customs union will be part of a transitional period before full Brexit. Mr Johnson also claimed the free movement of people was not a fundamental EU freedom, even though it was set out in the Treaty of Rome. To some Conservative MPs, this is Boris being Boris: speaking truth clumsily and causing unnecessary offence. To others, it is Mr Johnson deliberately pushing the boundaries, trying to nudge Downing Street down a path that he and other Brexiteers wish to travel. Either way, the interview gave the prime minister's opponents a big stick with which to beat her at question time in the House of Commons. One MP said that Theresa May will not have liked that and pointed out that at no time did she refer to Mr Johnson or praise him during her replies. But one Downing Street source said: ""If you were to sit down with the PM tonight for a whisky, she would not tell you that Boris Johnson is a problem. Her big problem is getting Whitehall to deliver what she wants."" There are some around the prime minister, however, who do not mind Mr Johnson taking some flak for the complexities and contradictions that leaving the EU will entail. This week the Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told Newsnight that Mr Johnson was saying things that are ""intellectually impossible"". The Italian economic development minister Carlo Calenda accused Mr Johnson of being ""insulting"" for suggesting that Italy should support a trade deal with the UK to avoid losing sales in Prosecco sparkling wine. One source said: ""Boris is like a cut-off, absorbing some of the noise that would otherwise come our way.""That may be but it might still a problem for No 10 if the foreign secretary is unnecessarily picking fights with the EU when he should be building bridges. Some EU diplomats say his chummy way of addressing them in a few mangled words of their language can be patronising rather than engaging. Few think he has much influence over the Brexit process. He has also upset some of his counterparts, the most important being Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany. This has not gone unnoticed in Whitehall. Other government officials are more positive. They say Mr Johnson is popular in the Foreign Office in the way his predecessors were not. The junior staff like the way he says hello to them. The senior staff empathise with his curious intellect and linguistic hunger. And they like the way he takes his briefs seriously and masters the detail quickly. The problem, some say, is that Mr Johnson is bored. He is being kept on a tight leash by Downing Street. No big interviews allowed, no big speeches planned, just endless ""grip and grins"" with visiting politicians and ""get to know you"" goodwill trips abroad. There are only so many times you can say that Britain will be engaged with the world post-Brexit.So the hunt is on for a role for the foreign secretary, a focus for his energy. One idea doing the rounds is for Mr Johnson to throw himself into shaping the thinking, as much as he can, of the incoming Trump administration. There is, the argument goes, a vacuum in much of the president-elect's foreign policy and it will be up others to fill that gap. Others doubt the foreign secretary has been in his post long enough to have a settled world view that he can pass on to Mr Trump. What is Mr Johnson's real strategic view, they ask, on Russia, the Middle East and global trade? Yet, astonishing as it may seem, in a short while Mr Johnson will be one of Europe's longer-serving foreign secretaries. By the end of next May, France, Germany and Italy will almost certainly have new foreign ministers who will be working alongside an equally new American secretary of state. Despite that, some officials note that Mr Johnson has yet to be tested by a big foreign policy crisis, such as the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Will he have the clout to get Britain into the room, to shape the policy, to impose his will on a fast moving event? That, they say, will be the time to judge the foreign secretary rather than blaming him personally for the failure of the whole government thus far to agree a strategy on Brexit.  "

2016-11-19,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161120051832/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

Labour's John McDonnell urged him to scrap benefit cuts.Mr Hammond refused to be drawn on his plans, but stressed economic ""credibility"" was key.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the UK's debt was still ""eye-wateringly"" large and plans must be ""responsible"".Some in Westminster expect Mr Hammond to use Wednesday's statement - one of two big economic statements of the year - to announce measures aimed at the key group of voters identified by Downing Street as the Just About Managing or JAMs, such as a freeze in fuel duty and measures to encourage saving.What is the Autumn Statement?£1.3bn to target congested roadsStatement teasers in the Sunday papersFinancial upheaval ahead for familiesDear Mr Hammond...The chancellor said he accepted there were ""people who work hard and by and large do not feel that they're sharing in the prosperity that economic growth is bringing to the country"", adding: ""We've got to make sure that the prosperity that comes from seizing opportunities ahead is shared across the country and across the income distribution."" He said ensuring job security for those people was ""a key priority"", but pressed on whether he would reverse cuts to Universal Credit, he said many forecasts were ""pointing to a slowing of economic growth next year and a sharp challenge for the public finances"".""There are a range of reasons for that and we've got to make sure that what we do is responsible, that everything we do is compatible with building resilience in our economy as we go into a period where there will be some uncertainty around the negotiation over our exit from the EU."" He added: ""I want to make sure that the economy is watertight, that we have enough headroom to deal with any unexpected challenges over the next couple of years and most importantly, that we're ready to seize the opportunities of leaving the European Union."" Labour says some working families will lose up to £1,300 a year by 2020 if planned benefit cuts go ahead.  And the Women's Budget Group think tank has claimed that women on average will be £1,003 a year worse off by 2020, compared with £555 for men, with women on lower incomes worst affected.Shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell told Mr Hammond: ""This is money coming out of the pockets of those doing everything that is asked of them - trying to get work, in work, looking after their children, contributing to society. ""Will you change direction? Because if you reverse the cuts to Universal Credit... you will have my support.""In reply, the chancellor told him: ""What I have not heard from you is where you would get the money from to do all these easy options.""  The row comes amid reports that the UK is facing a projected £100bn ""black hole"" in its finances due to the UK vote to leave the EU.Asked about continued calls for the government to say more about its aims in Brexit negotiations, Mr Hammond pointed to the ""commendable discipline"" from other European leaders when it came to not discussing their opening positions and said Prime Minister Theresa May must be given the same ""flexibility"". He added that he was ""surprised by the degree to which the cabinet is coming together around a view of the opportunities and the challenges ahead"". Earlier it was revealed that around a billion pounds will be spent on improving England's roads.The remainder of a £1.3bn Treasury pot earmarked for infrastructure investment will be split between Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although the devolved administrations can choose to spend that money as they see fit.But Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, told BBC Radio 5live the announcement was ""a relatively small amount of money in the context of transportation."" Mr McDonnell said the government was ""going back to giveaways and gimmicks"", and re-announcing ""press releases we've had already"".Labour, he said, would invest an extra £500bn in the economy over 10 years to boost economic growth by 1-2%, half of which would be leveraged from the private sector through a national investment bank.And he vowed that a future Labour government would halt tax cuts to the rich and big corporations."

MPs said they had ""serious concerns"" about the funding and timetable of the new fleet, and the country's ability to handle threats from areas like Russia.Cutting steel on new frigates in 2017Sounding out the Senior ServiceThey also attacked the MoD for the ""extraordinary mistakes"" in the design of Type 45 destroyers after it emerged they had faulty engines unable to operate continuously in warm waters.""The UK's enduring presence in the Gulf should have made it a key requirement for the engines. The fact that it was not was an inexcusable failing and one which must not be repeated,"" the MPs' report said.And it added: ""Failure to guarantee this would put the personnel and ships of the Royal Navy in danger, with potentially dangerous consequences.""Defence committee chairman Julian Lewis said MPs were ""putting the MoD on notice"" to deliver the modernisation programme on time.He said: ""For decades, the numbers of Royal Navy escort vessels have been severely in decline.""The fleet is now way below the critical mass required for the many tasks which could confront it, if the international scene continues to deteriorate.""The MoD says it is investing billions of pounds in two new aircraft carriers as well as new warships and submarines with the goal of increasing the size of the Royal Navy.""This major programme of investment will ensure that the Royal Navy remains one of the world's most modern and powerful navies with a genuine global reach,"" it said in a statement.It added that the Type 45 destroyer was a ""hugely capable"" ship, but it was ""committed to improving"" the vessel's ""power and propulsion system""."
2016-11-20,Britain 'sleepwalking into care crisis',https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38047078,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkBritain is in danger of ""sleepwalking into a social care crisis"", a former pensions minister has warned. Ros Altmann called on the government to use tax breaks to help people save for care in later life, as she said the cost of funding provision was pushing the NHS in England to breaking point.  She said she warned other ministers of looming problems last year.The Department of Health said it was significantly raising the funds local authorities have access to for care.Lady Altmann, who was pensions minister under David Cameron, said the chancellor should use Wednesday's Autumn Statement to offer incentives to help families ""recognise the need"" to prepare for care costs.  ""This should have been done years ago, but successive governments have failed to offer any help,"" she said.  ""Government spends billions on private pensions tax breaks, and there is a state pension to provide a base level of support, but there are no incentives to set money aside for care costs.""What is the Autumn Statement?Cuts in social care funding in England have been blamed for a sharp increase in the number of patients stuck in hospital beds because care cannot be arranged elsewhere.Lady Altmann, who left her government post in Theresa May's reshuffle in July, said the NHS cannot carry on picking up the pieces of a ""broken care system"".""Care has been left to cash-strapped councils keep who keep cutting provision,"" she said. She suggests a new ISA to help people save for care could be introduced and firms could offer ""eldercare vouchers"" along the lines of the childcare voucher scheme, which attracts tax relief.Lady Altmann told the BBC she had sent a memo around Whitehall when she was appointed after the May 2015 general election, warning that the issue of care costs could cause significant social and economic distress.The Department of Health said local authorities in England had been given powers to raise extra money for social care through higher council taxes, and other funding would be available from next April.A spokesman said: ""This government is committed to making sure older people throughout the country get affordable and dignified care. ""We are significantly increasing the amount of money local authorities have access to for social care, by up to £3.5bn by 2020.""Our care Act also introduced the biggest reforms to social care in over 65 years to make support more consistent across the country."""

Mr Nuttall and Ms Evans are seen as the front-runners while Mr Rees-Evans has claimed the leadership will be a ""coronation"". The contest is the second since the party's long-term leader Mr Farage quit in June in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the European Union.  UKIP leadership: The contendersWhere did it all go wrong for UKIP?Mr Farage returned as interim leader after his replacement Diane James quit in October just over two weeks into the job, saying she did not have ""sufficient authority"" to see through the changes she had planned.Soon afterwards the man seen as the favourite to succeed her, Steven Woolfe, quit the party altogether after being involved in a fracas at the European Parliament with another UKIP MEP. Mr Nuttall, who was Mr Farage's deputy leader for six years, told BBC One's Daily Politics: ""I'm standing on a platform of unity and experience.""I believe that the party has to come together if it is not only to survive but prosper. I believe I'm the best candidate to ensure that happens. I'm not part of any faction of the party and beyond that I've done every job in the party.""He added: ""UKIP has to unite, we are on 13% in the opinion polls, the future is bright, there are open goals but UKIP has to be on the pitch to kick the ball in.""Ms Evans, the former party deputy chairman who was suspended from it due to an internal dispute during the last leadership contest, told the BBC: ""I have a huge amount of experience in the party as well and I have also got a background that I think means I can help bring people together."" She said the party was ""at its best when it is scaring the political establishment"", but it had to start winning seats at elections ""right across the country"" by broadening its appeal to women, ethnic minority voters and Labour supporters.Both were critical of the controversial ""Breaking Point"" poster that Mr Farage unveiled during the EU referendum campaign that showed a long line of migrants.Ms Evans said it was the ""wrong poster at the wrong time"", while Mr Nuttall described it as ""clumsy and I thought it was wrong to do so just a week before the referendum"" - although he added that it had addressed ""genuine concerns"" about immigration.Asked whether they admired Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Ms Evans said: ""No, I don't"" - citing his actions in Ukraine, Georgia and the Alexander Litvinenko case - Mr Nuttall said that ""in the Middle East he is generally getting it right in many areas"", but added that he thought he was ""pretty much a nasty man"".He said: ""We need to bring the conflict in Syria to an end as fast as possible. The British line and the American line before Trump has been 'Let's arm these rebels.' These rebels include the al-Nusra Front, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda, the Syrian mujahideen which is linked to the Taliban. We need to clear these people out and ensure that Syria becomes a stable state.""Businessman Mr Rees-Evans stormed out of a hustings meeting in Newport earlier this month claiming he had been asked not to ""rock the boat"".He told the programme he wanted to offer members the chance to propose policies via a ""UKIP Direct"" website, saying: ""We have really dedicated passionate supporters who feel like they are not really being listened to... even at a branch level, people feel that there is not adequate flow of communication up and down the party. I want to rectify all of that.""While he is in favour of the death penalty, Mr Rees-Evans said he would not have the authority to determine party policy on the issue without putting it to the members. He said the ""mainstream media"" was trying to trivialise his campaign by focusing on ""pretty irrelevant"" issues, but added: ""What I'm actually trying to do in this party is trying to revolutionise the democratic process in the UK."""
2016-11-20,McDonnell 'can't stop Benn deselection',https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38044763,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkShadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he ""can't interfere"" in local party democracy amid reports that Hilary Benn is facing deselection.""Labour leadership doesn't involve itself in local selections to the local party. That's democracy,"" he said.It comes amid reports of a ""takeover"" of Mr Benn's local party by Jeremy Corbyn-supporting members.Mr Corbyn sacked Mr Benn as shadow foreign secretary in June, sparking a wave of resignations from his top team. Government-backed plans to change constituency boundaries and reduce the number of seats from 650 to 600 means dozens of sitting MPs are likely to face a selection battle.  Mr Benn, MP for Leeds Central and now chairman of the new cross-party select committee set up to scrutinise Brexit, was reported to be ""relaxed"" about changes to his local constituency party at a recent annual meeting.But the Sunday Times quoted the leader of a campaign to get pro-Corbyn activists onto positions in the local party, as saying there were ""quite a few people"" who would vote to oust Mr Benn over the resignations.He is also unpopular with many supporters of Mr Corbyn after arguing against him in support of UK involvement in air strikes against Islamic State in Syria.Asked about the reports on BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr McDonnell said: ""Hilary is a friend of mine and makes a major contribution to the party.""But asked if he would tell local activists to ""back off"", he said: ""The whole point of democracy in our party is we've said we're not in favour of mandatory reselection. The boundary changes we're opposing... and we're hoping the government will start listening on that. ""But where there are, because of boundary changes, reselection - that's dealt with at the local level.""He added that Mr Benn had ""a fantastic role to play"" and he hoped ""he continues to play a role in our party at whatever level"", but added: ""We can't interfere in local democracy in our party. We're a democratic party.""Mr Benn's departure from Labour's front bench after the referendum was followed by dozens of resignations, with many of those quitting criticising Mr Corbyn's performance in the EU campaign. Mr Corbyn went on to lose a no-confidence vote by his own MPs by 172 to 40, and faced a leadership challenge. But he was comfortably re-elected leader in September thanks to his popularity with party members. Labour MP Pat Glass has introduced a private member's bill aiming to stop plans to cut the number of constituencies, arguing it could break the MP-constituency link by making seats bigger. But Conservative MP David Nuttall suggested Labour MPs opposed moves to change constituency boundaries on the grounds they were ""frightened of reselection because of the threat of [pro-Corbyn campaign group] Momentum taking their seats""."

The Northern Powerhouse idea is aimed at ending the UK's economic reliance on London. Earlier this year the Conservative government said it was spending £13bn on transport for the Northern Powerhouse over the course of this Parliament ""including dramatic improvements to our roads and railways in the North"".But the Labour figures, who include Greater Manchester mayoral candidate Andy Burnham, say there is now an added need, following the ""wake up"" call of the Brexit vote, which will see changes to the economy once the UK leaves the EU.They say investors could lose confidence in the region - and the concept of a ""Northern Powerhouse"" - if there is not a realignment of how money is invested in regional transport. ""Decades of unfair allocations from the transport budget have left the North with an inadequate rail system and motorways that are at saturation point,"" said Mr Burnham.""If people in London and the South East had to put up with the North's transport system, there would be protests in the streets. It is our turn to come to the front of the queue for transport investment and that must start this week.""In the 2016 Budget, the-then chancellor, George Osborne, announced £60m would be allocated to develop plans to cut journey times to around 30 minutes between Leeds and Manchester, as well as improving transport connections between other cities in the north.It was Mr Osborne, in a speech in 2014, who said: ""I'm here to talk to you today about what we can do to make the cities of the north a powerhouse for our economy."""

I am a republican but when it comes to decisions like that, I think they are left to her.""An online petition created on Friday calling for the Royal family to fund the repairs themselves has gathered around 50,000 signatures.Mr McDonnell also indicated that he may have knelt before the Queen when he was recently inducted into the Privy Council.Asked if he went on ""bended knee"", he said: ""I did the usual protocols.""""I think you're not supposed to talk about what happens...

It comes as other senior Tories are urging the PM to drop an appeal against a ruling that MPs must vote on Brexit before the process can begin.The group of 60 Tories - out of a total of 328 Conservative MPs - want Britain to pull out of both the European single market and the customs union, which allows its members to trade without tariffs but imposes common duties on goods imported from outside the bloc.Ms Fernandes said the 23 June vote to leave the EU had been ""an instruction to untie ourselves from EU shackles and freely embrace the rest of the world"".""As was made clear in the referendum campaign, remaining in the EU's internal market like Norway, or in a customs union like Turkey, is not compatible with either of these commitments and doing so would frustrate the will of the electorate.""A government spokeswoman said it was committed to getting a unique deal for Britain, ""not an 'off the shelf' solution"".She said: ""The government is painstakingly analysing the challenges and opportunities for all the different sectors of our economy.""The prime minister has been clear that she wants UK companies to have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market - and to let European businesses do the same here.""Beyond that, it's not in the UK's interest to give a running commentary on our thinking that could undermine our negotiating position.""Meanwhile, Sir Oliver Letwin, former head of the government's Brexit preparations, and two former law officers said the appeal against a court ruling that means MPs must vote on the UK leaving the EU should not go to the Supreme Court.Instead, they want ministers to bring a bill to Parliament to start the process of Brexit as soon as possible.Former minister Sir Oliver told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Supreme Court hearing could see ministers' powers outside Parliament curbed.He said that bringing a bill to Parliament would give the government the ability to trigger Brexit without any constraints on its negotiating power.Former Solicitor General Sir Edward Garnier said Mrs May should drop the appeal to avoid expense and a row about judges' powers, while former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he could not see the point of continuing with the case.The government said it would robustly defend its position at the appeal and said: ""As the prime minister made clear [on Friday], our work is on track and we remain committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year.""A final judgement from the Supreme Court is not expected until January."

""They have been given a three-month window to come up with what in some cases will be multiple millions of pounds.""The Eclipse partnership lost a Supreme Court appeal earlier this year over its use of tax breaks introduced by the government in 1997 to encourage investment in the film industry.Now HMRC is demanding that investors repay their original investment many times over, because of the way the scheme was designed.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said that to make a £1m investment, an Eclipse partner might contribute only £20,000 of their own money and borrow the rest.""The tax relief on the whole amount would have been up to £400,000, or 20 times what they had risked. Here, HMRC may seek to recover the full £400,000,"" he said.Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the all-party group on responsible taxation, said HMRC was right to pursue investors.""If somebody cheats the benefit system, they have to pay the money back and are named and shamed. If somebody cheats the tax system, they should be treated in exactly the same way,"" she said."

Or do we take what might be the more difficult approach - to restore hope?""We can see the choice being taken by politicians on the hard right - to whip up division against migrants, Muslims, Mexicans, women, LGBT people, people with disabilities.""The fake anti-elitism of rich, white men - like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump - is farcical at one level, but in reality it's no joke at all.""We've seen a similar phenomenon in the US since last week's presidential election as we saw after Brexit: an appalling rise in hate crime.""Saying anything to win a vote has consequences on the ground afterwards.""Mr Farage campaigned alongside Mr Trump in the race for the White House and was the first politician from the UK to meet the president-elect after his election victory.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentJeremy Corbyn's message was clear. If you have lost trust in politicians, well, don't go for fake anti-elitism. Go for the real thing. Him.But in order to distance himself from conventional parliamentarians he renewed his attack on the pre-Corbyn Labour leadership which, he said, had become too complacent about inequality.  He now wants his National Policy Forum to turn the pledges he made in his leadership campaign in to detailed policy.But while the broad anti-austerity thrust of his message is unlikely to be challenged, he may find the policy forum won't simply rubber stamp all of his ideas.In an internal election for that body's vice-chair, the left-wing candidate closest to his own views was roundly defeated.And a potential showdown with critics over future leadership rules has been put on hold as his team believe an early general election is likely.But Mr Corbyn said it was ""down to Labour to restore hope - and give people the chance to take back real control"", echoing the slogan of the EU referendum's Leave campaign.He said the Tories had ""fanned the flames of fear over immigration, whipping up hatred in the referendum campaign - egged on by their UKIP sidekicks"".Rejecting some Labour MPs' calls to commit to net migration targets, Mr Corbyn said: ""We have to choose a different path; there can be no accommodation, now and never, with hate.""We will not make false promises on immigration targets as the Tories have done or sow divisions, but we will take decisive action to end the undercutting of workers' pay and conditions, reinstate the Migrant Impact Fund to support public services, and back fair rules on migration."""

They need to get rid of Alexis Jay, who's been parachuted in by the Home Office. She's not the right person."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna called for a new head, but inquiry panel member Dru Sharpling defended chairwoman Prof Jay as being ""qualified for the job.""Prof Jay wrote that the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association ""condemns me for having been a social worker and asks how this inquiry can truly be independent.""But anyone who knows me, has worked with me or is familiar with my record at other inquiries knows I have vigorously scrutinised the work of social workers and all other agencies.""The inquiry said in a statement: ""Our investigation will continue and will examine the scale and nature of the abuse that may have taken place under the care of Lambeth Council with pace, confidence and clarity.""The inquiry has been beset by difficulties since it was set up in July 2014 to investigate allegations made against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions in England and Wales, as well as people in the public eye.Three chairwomen - former president of the High Court Family Division Baroness Butler-Sloss, her replacement, leading lawyer Dame Fiona Woolf, and Justice Goddard, a New Zealand high court judge - have already stood down before Prof Jay took charge. A number of senior lawyers on the inquiry have also quit - the most recent of which was Aileen McColgan, who resigned on Wednesday amid concerns about the inquiry's leadership."

2016-11-20,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

2016-11-20,Breitbart rising,https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-38005983,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA once-fringe online news site has deep connections with Donald Trump and the UK Independence Party. So what's the story behind Breitbart?Just days after the US election, an ebullient Nigel Farage made his way to Trump Tower in New York - the first British politician to meet the president-elect.""We're just tourists!"" Farage joked to waiting reporters.By his side was his former aide and the London editor of Breitbart News, Raheem Kassam. And Kassam's ultimate boss, Stephen Bannon, has been lined up for a top White House job as Trump's chief strategist.Key figures at Breitbart News - a fast-growing conservative website that has been condemned by some commentators as racist and misogynist - are connected with both the Trump campaign and with the UK Independence Party. The White House was probably a distant dream when conservative entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart launched Breitbart.tv in 2007. It built on his earlier work for online outlets such as the conservative Drudge Report and liberal Huffington Post, along with an early iteration of his eponymous site which collected news links.The site first gained notoriety with videos targeting liberal groups and politicians. In 2011, it scored a major scoop when it exposed former Democratic congressman Anthony Wiener's sexting scandal.In 2012, Andrew Breitbart died of heart failure. Bannon became executive chairman.""The site used to be a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred conservative website that held liberals to account and resisted political correctness,"" says Jesse Singal, a writer-at-large with New York Magazine who's tussled with Breitbart in the past. ""They've turned much more extreme since Andrew Breitbart died.""From its base in California, the site has expanded, opening bureaus in Texas, Jerusalem and, in 2014, London. ""We look at London and Texas as two fronts in our current cultural and political war,"" Bannon said at the time.At the outset of the marathon US election campaign, the site initially seemed to back Texas Senator Ted Cruz.But a key moment came in March when Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, Trump's then campaign manager. Charges were filed but later dropped. After Fields was criticised - and Lewandowski defended - by some of her Breitbart colleagues, there were several resignations from the website.In August, Bannon was picked to lead Trump's campaign. It was a sign of the site's influence. Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart reporter whose beat was the Hillary Clinton campaign, says the site doesn't pretend to balance all sides of an issue.""The ethic of objectivity as it's traditionally formulated is not practised there,"" he says. However he defends the spin by saying the site is up-front about it. ""I never made any pretence about the fact that I did not want Hillary Clinton to be president.""Future expansion targets include France and Germany. ""Their model is to identify areas where there are two ingredients, the potential to exploit or inflame racial anxieties, anti-Muslim sentiment, anti-feminist sentiment,"" says Angelo Carusone, executive vice president of the left-wing think tank Media Matters. He predicts they will back the National Front in France.

He later withdraws13 November 2016: Following the election, Bannon is picked to be Trump's chief strategistIn the days since the election and Bannon's appointment, there's been a lot of coverage about the site's most provocative content, including a set of much-discussed headlines: This however is just one slice of Breitbart's output, which is a hodgepodge of factual stories provided by news wires, provocative opinion designed to infuriate liberals and whip up conservatives, cheerleading for Trump and right-wing ideas, and attack pieces on celebrities, journalists and other perceived enemies. The company produces videos, movies, radio shows and podcasts and has a huge social media presence.It's all presented in a tabloid style - and the site has no clear delineations between news, analysis, commentary and opinion. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Kassam described the site's style: ""Is it ugly? Yes. Is it varnished? No. But is it truthful? Absolutely.""Howley says the site's approach is straightforward. ""We are honest about it,"" he says. ""If you suspend objectivity you can build great sources and develop an audience and the information is all the same.""Howley, who says there is no written code of ethics or guidelines for Breitbart journalists, argues the site tapped into the ""populist side of the conservative movement which wasn't really represented in the press"". He resigned from Breitbart on election night, saying that the company had grown and changed substantially in his time there and that he was interested in other reporting projects.Editor-at-large Joel Pollak has denied the site is racist or sexist. The staff are ""happy warriors"", Pollak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Andrew Breitbart founded it to take on the mainstream media, to take on the institutional left and to take on the Republican Party establishment. There is in a sense a populist undercurrent in the website but that's not angry."" Over the last 18 months, Breitbart's fortunes have risen in line with Trump's. According to web analytics company Comscore, the site has added millions of readers since Donald Trump started his run to the presidency. Its monthly US audience is now more than 19 million, which puts it ahead of many mainstream news sites.In Britain it has a much narrower reach, even factoring in the UK's smaller population - Comscore puts its monthly unique users at under 700,000.If you visit the site and click around, you're just as likely to find straight news (""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on 'the twin interests of peace and security'"") as you are to see freewheeling pro-Trump hype (""It happened. We won! We now live in the Age of Daddy!"")In that respect, Breitbart is distinct from the ""fake news"" industry that received so much attention after the election. Critics note that its stories might be made up of facts, but spun and deployed hard against its main bugbears - including liberals, refugees (particularly from the Muslim world), and feminism. In August, the site published a story headlined ""TB spiked 500 percent in Twin Falls during 2012, as Chobani Yoghurt opened plant"".The story was one of several the site ran about a small city in Idaho and Chobani, one of America's leading yogurt brands. Chobani is owned by Hamdi Ulukaya, a billionaire immigrant from Turkey. Ulukaya has ties to President Obama and has employed refugees at his plants in Idaho and elsewhere.The story linked a rise in tuberculosis cases to the yogurt plant and refugees living locally.But there was more to the story. The ""500 percent"" spike in the headline represented an increase from one case - to six. Those six cases, according to Tom Shanahan of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, were all diagnosed prior to the Chobani plant opening in December 2012.By 2015, the number of cases was back down to just one. Shanahan says that the Breitbart story was ""misleading"", that the tuberculosis spike was not statistically significant and that it could not be linked to the yogurt plant or refugees in the area. In the UK, following the EU referendum in June, several stories on the site poked holes in a reports which suggested that hate crimes had spiked by 57%.The cause and effect around current events and hate crimes is complicated and awareness of how to report them boosts statistics. However there was no mention on Breitbart of later analysis by the Home Office which showed a 41% rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote. ""It's a more radical Fox News. It's living in a different world, a much more fearful world, where rumour and innuendo are passed around as fact,"" says Singal. Breitbart also runs sharply critical stories on other journalists and news outlets and mocks reporters who complain about trolls and slurs. ""Every special snowflake reporter with a Twitter account wanted in on the sweet victimhood action,"" taunted one writer, criticising journalists who found themselves being shouted at by Trump supporters at campaign rallies.Mainstream media reporters who have been the subject of Breitbart pieces have at times found themselves on the receiving end of online trolling. The BBC has spoken to several who have had rape and death threats against themselves and their families, and several from news outlets in the US and the UK said they or their colleagues have been cautious about writing about the site for fear of the resultant backlash.There's no implication that Breitbart reporters or employees are directing the trolling or participating in it themselves. (Although one Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, was banned from Twitter for firing off unpleasant messages to actress Leslie Jones.) And Breitbart is far from the only news source to whip its audience into action. At the same time the company and its journalists don't hesitate to complain about alleged abuse against themselves.Stephen Bannon: Breitbart's executive chairman, he left to run the Trump campaign and has been lined up for a job as senior strategist in the Trump White House. In a rare speech in 2014, he had words of praise for UKIPNigel Farage: The UKIP leader is a regular Breitbart columnistRaheem Kassam: Hired by Bannon to be Breitbart's London editor, he was a chief adviser to Farage during the 2015 general election, and briefly ran for UKIP leader himself before dropping outRobert Mercer: A Breitbart funder and investor in Cambridge Analytica, the data firm used by EU referendum Leave campaigners and the Trump campaign. His daughter, Rebekah Mercer, is part of Trump's transition teamArron Banks: This major UKIP donor backed Kassam's leadership bid and bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign, enlisting the help of Cambridge AnalyticaRaheem Kassam, the site's London editor, made a brief run for UKIP leader. After dropping out of the race, Kassam said he would pursue a harassment case against journalists from the Times, claiming they intimidated his parents in the course of writing a profile on him. The Times characterised the encounter as a ""short, polite conversation with a family member"" in the course of ""standard reporting practice"".The site, which frequently argues in favour of free speech, has vowed to sue an unnamed media outlet for calling it a ""white nationalist"" website. Thus far, no legal action has commenced. Breitbart's funding sources are somewhat obscure. As a private company, Breitbart has declined to reveal its investors or how it makes money. In 2014, before its overseas expansion, Bannon said that the site wasn't quite profitable. There are ads on the site and it also sells merchandise such as campaign coffee cups.It has been reported that the company has been funded by Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund manager who is the founder of Cambridge Analytica, a data firm which worked for the Leave.EU campaign as well as Trump's bid for the White House.  Mercer's daughter Rebekah is part of Trump's transition team. Another big Leave.EU backer was UKIP donor Arron Banks, who accompanied Farage and Kassam to Trump Tower. In Washington, the big question people have been asking about Bannon is how he will act in the Trump administration, and what the role of Breitbart will be once he's there. Prior to the election, Bannon said he would return to the company - but that was before Trump's victory and his White House appointment. Under ethics rules, Bannon has 30 days from taking office in January to declare his financial ties to Breitbart.Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who resigned after the Fields incident, says in his view the site's function won't change when Trump becomes president.""It will be the propaganda arm of the administration,"" he says. ""Their mandate is to create conflict, controversy and divisiveness - as well as propping up President Trump,"" he says. But conservative journalist Cathy Young, who clashed with Breitbart after denouncing what she saw as the site's whitewashing of the extremist alt-right, argues that those might take a back seat to a more pragmatic political style.""My guess would be that Bannon will be less of a champion of the alt-right than a political pit bull who will use whatever weapon he can to pursue the victory of the person he's promoting.""For his part, Farage has offered to act as a conduit between the US and the UK - a proposal that Downing Street quickly rebuffed.  Breitbart did not respond to requests to comment for this story, and several reporters and staff members also did not respond to questions. Carusone, from Media Matters, thinks that calling Breitbart ""propaganda"" slightly misstates its role, and says its real function in a Trump White House could be to shore up support on the far right. ""There's been a consensus in some parts of the media that Trump is softening on some of his policies,"" he says. ""Part of the role of Breitbart will be to give a wink and a nod to Trump's most fervent supporters to let them know he's still on their side.""Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter"

While recent data has shown a robust economy, a slowdown in growth is being forecast for next year.Uncertainty over Brexit has weakened the pound, which has been great for exporters but has made imported goods and raw materials more expensive.The BBC has been speaking to businesses from across the UK, finding out how their bosses are feeling and what they would like to see from the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, 23 November.In Scunthorpe Shay Eddy, the managing director of SC4 Steel which supplies the construction industry, is feeling optimistic.""We're certainly in a better position than we were 12 months ago.""We invested at the bottom of the cycle, we ordered a new machine that's just been commissioned now. We've just committed to another machine and we're looking at expanding and exporting starting January next year.""But like other businesses, he wants to know more about the UK's future relationship with Europe.""More clarity would be ideal because uncertainty is no good for anybody, but we can't expect the government to tip their hand as to what they are going to be negotiating with,"" he says.Norbar Torque Tools, based in Banbury, is one of Oxfordshire's best known exporters. As 35% of its sales go to mainland Europe the firm is closely watching the Brexit debate.""The single most important thing for exporting companies like us is that the government negotiates access to the single market on favourable terms,"" says commercial director Catherine Rohl.She is also worried about the supply of skilled workers. ""It is a concern, particularly here in Banbury where unemployment is very low. And if it is going to be more difficult to recruit from across the EU in future, then that becomes even more difficult.""She says the chancellor can help with that with more support for training, education and apprenticeships in science and engineering subjects.Nick Grey is the founder and chief executive of Gtech, a Worcester-based firm that makes cordless vacuum cleaners and garden tools.He would like the chancellor to support research and development by extending tax breaks for investment in R&D.""It's a good incentive, it's reasonably generous. Don't take it away definitely, and a bit more would be welcome,"" he says.In South Wales construction giant Costain is working on a £200m road project that involves building 16 structures, 12km (7.5 miles) of retaining walls and moving 2.5 million tonnes of soil and rocks.Bruce Richards, who is managing the project, says that 70% of the contracts involved have been awarded to firms in South Wales, creating 180 jobs in the process.""We believe the government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure. We hope in the Autumn Statement that way of thinking will continue,"" he says.Northern Ireland was one of the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis, with around a third of all jobs in the construction industry lost after 2008. ""The construction sector in Northern Ireland was very dramatically hit by the recession. I'm pleased to say now that we're starting to see a more fragile recovery,"" says Ray Hutchinson, managing director of Gilbert Ash, a construction firm that is building a new Marriott Hotel in Belfast. However, his company is focusing on the south-east of England where growth is stronger.Mr Ash says that ""a number"" of projects have been paused as clients weigh up the implications of Brexit.""We will be looking to the chancellor to increase spending on infrastructure,"" he says. ""Certainly that could have a very dramatic economic stimulus on the entire economy in the UK."""
2016-11-20,Give and take,https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38013591,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA class of Ugandan schoolgirls lines up under a tree. They are waiting to receive the HPV vaccine, which will protect them from cervical cancer. The project is run by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which in turn has received a significant amount of funding from British taxpayers. With a budget of more than £12bn, the Department for International Development is an arm of government with spending power that is likely to keep growing. The UK has passed a bill that enshrines in law its commitment to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on aid every year.  But that commitment, while welcomed by some as a mark of British generosity, is dismissed by others as a licence to spend money on projects of dubious value. The Conservative MP and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell is a staunch defender.""There is massive need, we can see it in the world today, huge discrepancies of opportunity, deep, deep poverty,"" he says. ""The British development budget is addressing these colossal discrepancies, and it does so extremely effectively."" The current Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, once advocated scrapping the department she now leads. And since taking up the role, she has stressed that it is in Britain's ""national interest"" to invest across the world, to alleviate poverty and suffering. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in September, Ms Patel said: ""Our aid programme forms a crucial part of Britain's soft power around the world. ""When people in refugee camps or remote communities see the Union Jack displayed proudly on our emergency supplies, they know they have a friend and an ally in Britain."" Some believe that world view may be given extra impetus by the need to forge trade deals, in the wake of Brexit. But Kirsty McNeill, executive director of policy and campaigns at Save the Children, says we should give because we can.""If I saw a drowning man in the Thames on the way home tonight and I saved him, it may well do wonders for my reputation, but that's not why I do it - I do it because if you can save a life, you should save a life,"" she says. Jonathan Foreman, author of Aiding and Abetting: Foreign Aid Failures and the 0.7% Deception, takes a far more sceptical view.He says that far from being good for the national image, if money is handed over to people in a country who are known to be powerful and corrupt, it can be very damaging.""People in those countries think you must have known it was a corrupt country, you must have known that school was not going to be built, and then they think you are in league with the people whose mis-governance is making this country such an impoverished place,"" he says. There are other pitfalls too.Owen Barder, from the Centre for Global Development think tank, says: ""The US and in the past the EU shipped a lot of food aid from our own countries.""It was in the national interest to buy it from our farmers and ship it there, but it was much more expensive. ""Our aid saved many fewer lives, and we drove local farmers and local suppliers out of business."" Given that ""promoting global prosperity"" is among Dfid's priorities, putting local traders out of business is not part of the plan.But Michela Wrong, the author of It's our turn to Eat - which looks at corruption in Kenya, believes there is another problem with the UK's choice of aid partners. She points to countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia and Uganda, which, she says, are not particularly good at promoting democracy and human rights but are successful at building schools and improving maternal health.""Is that model really sustainable?"" she asks.Mr Mitchell accepts this is not ideal but says the aid relationship is not with the governments but with the people. And if you withdraw the aid, ""you're taking girls out of school, or stopping farmers accruing the knowledge to be able to feed themselves and their locality"". One of Ms Patel's priorities is to deliver value for money in aid - but some in the aid world argue it is not always easy to measure outcomes. You may be able to count the number of children that have been given access to a school, but how can you assess the quality of the education they have received? Many of these arguments have been thrashed out in the development world for decades, but Mr Barder says the problems traditionally linked to aid should have an even bigger resonance now because they try to address shared problems.""Like climate change, which we have to tackle together, problems of conflict and insecurity, problems of global health, of inequality and those requiring shared policy solutions, aid is part of the solution,"" says Mr Barder.""The votes we have seen on Brexit and Donald Trump are the people saying to the politicians, 'You are not addressing these problems fast enough and in the way we need.'"" But as electorates reject global trade deals and multinational groupings such as the EU, it may be more difficult than ever to persuade countries to work together. At the same time, the problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability.In Uganda, the plan is to end the support for the vaccination programme by 2020, when it is hoped the country will be wealthier. But for the moment, British taxpayers will continue to help protect the health of Ugandan children.  "
2016-11-20,Statement of intent,https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38011185,"You may not have noticed it yet, but next week's Autumn Statement will be a big test of the prime minister's seriousness.  Theresa May is making an extraordinary claim - to be the Western leader who gets the zeitgeist, who has the answers others are too timid to grasp, without being so headstrong that she threatens the whole system of world capitalism. The overarching question about the chancellor's first major economic pronouncement will be ""What does it say about Brexit?"".This is entirely right and proper. Philip Hammond wouldn't be in charge of the UK economy without that vote - George Osborne would still be in post. The direction Mr Hammond takes will depend on whether he thinks Britain is more likely to boom or bust outside the European Union. In some quarters, he is already castigated for not sticking to a ""happy clappy"" script.Sensible people agree Brexit is an economic leap in the dark, destination unknown. But to some, acknowledging this is akin to heresy.  Our leap, they insist, will be on to a rainbow from where we will slide gently to a pot of gold.  If Mr Hammond's economic analysis suggests it might be best to brace for a bumpy landing on the rocks below - just in case - some will regard that as defeatist whingeing. We need to look out for growth and tax forecasts and measures to buttress a faltering economy, but tone and presentation will be important too. The shock absorbers he does - or does not - put in place will tell us something about this government's true perception of Brexit, but its ambitions to reshape the British economy are far more significant. It should tell us more about the intention and beliefs of the second most intriguing politician in the world - Mrs May. I would not have dreamed of writing that a few months ago, but as she herself said recently, we live in ""a world transformed"".Of course what she does as prime minister at a critical time for our country is important, but it is much more than that.She appears to be putting herself forward as the first leader in the world who will respond to a wave of populist discontent she neither encouraged nor summoned.  She makes clear her job is to ameliorate a mood that is sweeping the West. Her mission is nothing less than saving globalisation and free trade from themselves. We are familiar with the terms ""centre right"" or ""centre left"". She seems to want ""centre populism"".  This may of course turn out to be traditional conservatism reheated in the rhetoric de jour, or it might be a wholehearted embrace of the radical ideas of the new hard right. Last week I wrote about the similarities between Donald Trump's victory and Brexit. There are many differences between the leader of the UK and the next leader of the US but one in particular is critical.Mr Trump not only skilfully surfed the wave of populism, he summoned the waters, encouraged the swell and used its gathering force to propel himself into power. Here, by contrast, Mrs May was a mere bystander as the flood smashed the existing political order to matchsticks, the would-be surfers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spectacularly wiped out by the waves and David Cameron and Mr Osborne turned into so much flotsam and jetsam. She was picked up and swept along in the tumult and deposited, almost accidently, in a high place, dryish and in charge.Mrs May could have been briskly business-like and insisted the only instruction from the referendum was the simple one on the ballot paper - to leave the EU. ""Brexit means Brexit"" to coin a phrase. But Mrs May agrees with the academics and journalists who say it means far more, that voters were expressing a wider mood of discontent. In her recent speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet she repeated the central tenets of her party conference speech.Brexit was a message about immigration and anger at a rich elite, some of whom ignore the rules others must obey. But above all, she said, politicians and business people had to accept that ""globalisation in its current form has left too many people behind"". And ""we can do much more to ensure the prosperity [globalisation and free trade] provide is shared by all"".Read this out of context and you might guess she is attempting to out-Corbyn Jeremy. Repeating ""prosperity shared by all"" twice in her speech might lead you to believe that ""Red Phil"" will be ordered to use the Autumn Statement to introduce a wealth tax of 90% on incomes of more than £200,000 and big corporate profits, and use the proceeds to treble the minimum wage, quadruple pensions and add a big fat nought to all benefits.This is probably not Mrs May's way of ""sharing prosperity"". So what will she do?Mr Trump wants to bring back jobs by introducing tariffs. That's not Mrs May's way either. Indeed, she wants to be ""the strongest global advocate for free markets and free trade"".So what could bring ""the left behinds"" (TLBs) right up front? Her answer? A new industrial strategy. The test of Mrs May's seriousness will be if this is the centrepiece of the Autumn Statement.The shimmering outlines of what an industrial strategy might be are just about visible - ""backing up the strengths"" of great universities, dynamic businesses, creating ""conditions where winners can emerge"" and ""developing untapped potential"".It's still rather hazy. To convince, Mr Hammond has to come up with spending promises and tax incentives to make this feel like new policy which will substantially change lives.  There are some signs ""the left behinds"" may lose out again to a newer group which has caught the PM's eye - the so-called ""Just about managing"", or Jams. The proposed help for them seems to be more in the nature of headline-grabbing gimmicks than a real change in policy.   If this is all talk, Mrs May is playing a dangerous game with the public mood.She must know she does not have much leeway. Because the President-elect was so brutally frank about his extreme prescriptions on the road to power, he can afford to tone it down a bit now. Donnie Darkmouth can, to an extent, morph into Temperate Trump.  But Mrs May did not originally champion or encourage the people who put her in power. She is calculating what they want, not expressing a shared fury, which means she risks sounding too shrill for those who do not share her prescription, while not doing enough to meet TLB or Jam concerns. There is a danger too in falling in love with what is fast becoming an overwhelming narrative. Whilst ""the left behinds"" is a useful catch-all, I prefer the idea of ""the disconnect"". Politicians will not be serving the national interest if they get the idea that courting former industrial workers undergoing a crisis of identity is all that matters. This government has only revealed itself in fits and starts: long on talk, short on policy. Next week we might see if it will put our money where its mouth is.  "

What does she need to do to keep her backbenchers on side?When she replaced him as prime minister in July, Theresa May also took on David Cameron's small Commons majority, and all the problems that come with it.The government's ""working majority"" - calculated when you take away the non-voting Speaker, deputy speakers and Sinn Fein members, as well as the two seats left vacant by the resignations of Conservatives Zac Goldsmith and Stephen Phillips - is just 14, meaning the prime minister needs to work extra hard to ensure her MPs back her, and her policies.If Labour, the SNP and other smaller parties work together on an issue, they need only to attract a handful of unhappy Conservatives - seven - to their side and the government risks defeat.Mrs May is widely regarded as one of the more ""unclubbable"" politicians, admitting when running for leadership of the Conservative party that she did not ""go drinking in Parliament's bars"" and preferred to get ""on with the job"".That has put her at a disadvantage, says The Spectator's Katy Balls, because she does not have a ready-made network of supporters.""Unlike George Osborne, who was constantly meeting with MPs and having drinks parties, Theresa May has never really courted her party like that,"" she says. ""They need a bit more TLC almost, to stay behaved. They're not getting that, which allows them to go a bit more rogue.""The single biggest issue on the prime minister's agenda is Brexit and, whether she likes it or not, it is likely to define her entire premiership.The government has been locked in a battle in the High Court against a ruling on triggering Article 50, the formal notification of leaving the EU. If the appeal in the Supreme Court fails and Mrs May is instead required to bring forward legislation in the Commons to trigger Brexit talks, she can expect to win the backing of her MPs. Labour will also vote in favour, though a handful of their MPs and some from smaller parties have told the BBC they will vote against.Former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who was a vocal Remain supporter during the campaign, has warned against the government's reluctance to allow Parliament to delve into the detail, arguing that a vote on Brexit would ""strengthen Theresa May's hand"".Another of her MPs has warned that the prime minister must not forget she has to take her MPs with her.Heidi Allen, whose maiden speech attacked the government's policy on tax credit cuts, says Mrs May is absolutely determined to deliver Brexit because that is what the British people want.""My sense is just that Theresa is an almost civil servant-like politician. She believes that she's got a job to do and nothing should stand in her way.""I think that it's her determination that's making her perhaps a little single-minded.""Former cabinet minister Peter Lilley is a veteran of the battles in the Conservative Party over Europe in the 1990s, which saw an organised rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty erode John Major's majority and turn him into a leader widely seen as lacking authority within his own party.Although Conservative MPs were broadly split over Leave and Remain before the referendum, Mr Lilley thinks most of them want to now make Brexit work.""They're relieved that the initial reaction of the economy has entirely wrong-footed the doom-mongers in the Treasury and the Bank of England,"" he says.""There's a feeling of pretty good unanimity. The vast majority of those who supported remain want to make a success of it.""Mrs May's political life is not all about Brexit.There has been disquiet over issues such as opening new grammar schools and welfare changes. Some are not happy over the ""trashing"" of David Cameron's legacy. So can the prime minister rely on that slim majority to hold?Ms Allen certainly thinks rebellion is a good thing, when well used.""We have a lot if independent-minded MPs,"" she says. ""We came here to make a difference, not just toe the party line.""Ms Soubry says she was heartened by the prime minister's first speech, delivered on the day she took over from Mr Cameron. Mrs May spoke of leading a government ""driven not by the interests of the privileged few"" and promised to make Britain ""a country that works for everyone"".However, Ms Soubry warns that her actions need to match her words.""If there's any disquiet, it's that Theresa needs now to be true now to the words, the sentiment, the admirable goals and her dream and vision of our country. She's now got to be true to what she said on the steps of Downing Street."""
2016-11-20,Is Boris bored?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38014012,"Boris Johnson is one of those few politicians whose notoriety gives their utterances a wider audience than Westminster. It is why he was such an effective advocate for Leave during the referendum. And it is why the prime minister will use him to sell the Brexit deal when eventually it is struck. So it will have come as no surprise to Mr Johnson to have attracted the attention this week of the actor Ewan McGregor - even if he might not have appreciated why. The star of Trainspotting and Star Wars, who has one million Twitter followers, used his social media account to criticise the foreign secretary for offering ""an impossible Brexit vision"". The cause of Mr McGregor's ire was Mr Johnson's interview with a Czech newspaper in which he suggested the UK might leave the EU customs union. This might not sound too controversial until you realise that doing that after Brexit is not actually government policy. Downing Street has deliberately kept its options open, leading some MPs to think that staying in the customs union will be part of a transitional period before full Brexit. Mr Johnson also claimed the free movement of people was not a fundamental EU freedom, even though it was set out in the Treaty of Rome. To some Conservative MPs, this is Boris being Boris: speaking truth clumsily and causing unnecessary offence. To others, it is Mr Johnson deliberately pushing the boundaries, trying to nudge Downing Street down a path that he and other Brexiteers wish to travel. Either way, the interview gave the prime minister's opponents a big stick with which to beat her at question time in the House of Commons. One MP said that Theresa May will not have liked that and pointed out that at no time did she refer to Mr Johnson or praise him during her replies. But one Downing Street source said: ""If you were to sit down with the PM tonight for a whisky, she would not tell you that Boris Johnson is a problem. Her big problem is getting Whitehall to deliver what she wants."" There are some around the prime minister, however, who do not mind Mr Johnson taking some flak for the complexities and contradictions that leaving the EU will entail. This week the Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told Newsnight that Mr Johnson was saying things that are ""intellectually impossible"". The Italian economic development minister Carlo Calenda accused Mr Johnson of being ""insulting"" for suggesting that Italy should support a trade deal with the UK to avoid losing sales in Prosecco sparkling wine. One source said: ""Boris is like a cut-off, absorbing some of the noise that would otherwise come our way.""That may be but it might still a problem for No 10 if the foreign secretary is unnecessarily picking fights with the EU when he should be building bridges. Some EU diplomats say his chummy way of addressing them in a few mangled words of their language can be patronising rather than engaging. Few think he has much influence over the Brexit process. He has also upset some of his counterparts, the most important being Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany. This has not gone unnoticed in Whitehall. Other government officials are more positive. They say Mr Johnson is popular in the Foreign Office in the way his predecessors were not. The junior staff like the way he says hello to them. The senior staff empathise with his curious intellect and linguistic hunger. And they like the way he takes his briefs seriously and masters the detail quickly. The problem, some say, is that Mr Johnson is bored. He is being kept on a tight leash by Downing Street. No big interviews allowed, no big speeches planned, just endless ""grip and grins"" with visiting politicians and ""get to know you"" goodwill trips abroad. There are only so many times you can say that Britain will be engaged with the world post-Brexit.So the hunt is on for a role for the foreign secretary, a focus for his energy. One idea doing the rounds is for Mr Johnson to throw himself into shaping the thinking, as much as he can, of the incoming Trump administration. There is, the argument goes, a vacuum in much of the president-elect's foreign policy and it will be up others to fill that gap. Others doubt the foreign secretary has been in his post long enough to have a settled world view that he can pass on to Mr Trump. What is Mr Johnson's real strategic view, they ask, on Russia, the Middle East and global trade? Yet, astonishing as it may seem, in a short while Mr Johnson will be one of Europe's longer-serving foreign secretaries. By the end of next May, France, Germany and Italy will almost certainly have new foreign ministers who will be working alongside an equally new American secretary of state. Despite that, some officials note that Mr Johnson has yet to be tested by a big foreign policy crisis, such as the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Will he have the clout to get Britain into the room, to shape the policy, to impose his will on a fast moving event? That, they say, will be the time to judge the foreign secretary rather than blaming him personally for the failure of the whole government thus far to agree a strategy on Brexit.  "

2016-11-20,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161121040553/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

2016-11-21,May 'trying to avoid Brexit cliff edge',https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38044015,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May has tried to reassure businesses fearing a sudden change in rules once the UK leaves the EU.Speaking at the CBI conference, Mrs May promised early agreement on the status of UK nationals in Europe and EU nationals in the UK. ""People don't want a cliff-edge; they want to know with some certainty how things are going to go,"" she said.Several business lobby groups have pushed for an interim deal to let them trade in the same way post-Brexit.Mrs May said she understood companies' concerns and was ""conscious that there will be issues that will need to be looked at"".""That will be part of the work that we do in terms of the negotiation that we are undertaking with the European Union,"" she added.She also pledged to provide clarity on the government's plans where possible, but said there would not be ""a running commentary on every twist and turn"".Downing Street declined to say whether Mrs May's comments about avoiding a ""cliff-edge"" meant she was seeking a transitional deal to cover the period between the UK's departure from the EU and the start of a new trade deal.""She was reflecting the views we have expressed already about how we secure the best deal for the UK and how we seek to provide certainty where we can to businesses and people across the UK of the steps moving forward,"" the PM's official spokeswoman said.In the wide-ranging speech, Mrs May also pledged to:The prime minister also insisted she still favoured worker representation on company boards, dismissing suggestions that comments she made during the speech marked a watering-down of the idea.There have been widespread reports since the summer that Mrs May wanted to see workers on boards as part of a corporate governance shake-up, an idea that had caused unease among companies and, according to the Financial Times, disagreements in Cabinet.However, the prime minister told the CBI that there were ""other routes"" to providing worker representation on boards, including advisory councils or panels. ""It will be a question of finding the model that works,"" she said.Mrs May promised to shake-up governance as part of her Conservative Party leadership campaign in July, and repeated the promise at last month's party conference when she said she planned to have ""not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well"".And later, on Sky News, when asked if her conference speech marked a watering down of the idea, Mrs May said. ""No, what I've always said is that we want to look at ways in which we can improve corporate governance, looking at a number of areas, including workers' representation on boards. You can do that in a number of ways. ""We want to work with business on this and that's why we'll be consulting later this year on the various ways in which we can do it to find a model that works,"" she said.Did the PM arrive at the CBI conference with an olive branch or just another stick? A little bit of both. Business groups have been wary of Theresa May ever since her blistering attack on the massive pay differentials, tax avoidance and treatment of workers she identified in some corners of British business. Today, she offered a more conciliatory tone. As well as weakening her commitment to put workers on company boards, saying only their voice should be represented - she insisted her agenda was unequivocally pro-business.  However, there was no escaping the big question as spelled out by the CBI's President, Paul Dreschler: ""What happens the day after we leave the EU? Government has a responsibility to keep uncertainty to a minimum. We understand, in negotiations, the need for discretion, we're not asking for a running commentary but we are looking for clarity and above all a plan.""Business folk were pleased to hear her say, when questioned, that she understood their fears over a potential cliff edge of trading and regulatory uncertainty the day after Britain leaves the EU but weren't so pleased she declined to reassure them with details of her plan.If business leaders were hoping to be treated to the same fireside chat that seemed to comfort the boss of Nissan, they would have left disappointed. £2bn of new money for research and development was welcomed and business leaders seemed to accept the essential premise of the grand bargain she is offering - the government invests to boost productivity and cut corporation tax in exchange for help in tackling the worst excesses of capitalism.'Clear promise'However, trade unions said they were disappointed by Mrs May's remarks. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Theresa May made a clear promise to have workers represented on company boards. The proposals in her speech do not deliver on this.""This is not the way to show that you want to govern for ordinary working people.""But CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said ""different approaches will work for different businesses"" on employee engagement.""A starting point is firms being able to outline and explain what approach they are taking - whether that's employees on boards, employee committees, dedicated representatives, or other models that genuinely address the issue.""What May did and didn't say at CBIWhat is the Autumn Statement?A difficult trick to pull offViews from UK businessFinancial upheaval ahead for familiesMrs May also promised to boost productivity and cut corporation tax in exchange for help from businesses in tackling issues such as executive pay and shareholder accountability.""Just as the government must open its mind to a new approach, so the business community must too,"" she said.The promises made by the prime minister include a ""patient capital review"" to help firms secure long-term investment. The review will be chaired by Sir Damon Buffini, the former head of private equity group Permira.Mrs May also said the government would review the support given to innovative firms through the tax system ""because my aim is not simply for the UK to have the lowest corporate tax rate in the G20, but also one that is profoundly pro-innovation.""Corporation tax is already due to fall from its current 20% rate to 17% by 2020.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the conference later in the day criticising the government's ""shambolic""  approach to Brexit which he said was hampering business's ability to plan. He set out Labour's approach to working with business, which he said would be characterised by ""good intervention"".He said Labour's policies would involve ""some increase in corporation tax"" and said the suggestion that the UK should aim to reduce corporation tax to 15% or below was ""reckless short-term grandstanding."" He called for more investment in housing, research and development and infrastructure, a higher minimum wage and measures to prevent undercutting of workers' pay and conditions."

He said Labour would increase investment in green technology and boost house building.Labour's ""settlement for business"", he said, ""will mean some increase in corporation tax while maintaining one of the lowest rates in the world"". He added: ""But see it as a sound investment not only in your own business's long-term future but for the common good of the country.""Mr Corbyn also warned of a ""chaotic"" Brexit and said Labour would campaign for Britain to ""retain full access to the single market"".Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin said: ""Jeremy Corbyn has shown once again that all Labour offer is a recipe for economic ruin, while they're totally out of touch with the public's concerns on immigration as we leave the EU.""Prime Minister Theresa May addressed the CBI earlier, announcing £2bn of annual investment in research and development by 2020 and an industrial strategy aimed at spreading economic growth across the UK."

Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokeswoman said: ""An invitation for a state visit is one of the things that is under consideration following the election of a new US president. One of the issues under consideration is the 2017 state visits.""State visits are formal trips to the UK by foreign heads of state from overseas. There are normally two a year and invitations are sent on the advice of the Foreign Office.Recent state visits to UKNovember 2016 - President Juan Manuel Santos of ColombiaOctober 2015 - President Xi Jinping of ChinaMarch 2015 - President Enrique Pena Nieto of MexicoOctober 2014 - President Tony Tan Keng Yam of SingaporeApril 2014 - President Michael D. Higgins of IrelandNovember 2013 - President Park Geun-hye of South KoreaThe Queen acts as host, with the visitor usually staying either at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. Visits normally begin with a ceremonial welcome attended by The Queen and other senior members of the Royal Family, while a State Banquet is held in his or her honour. Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, made a state visit to the UK in 2011.In January, MPs debated whether Mr Trump should be banned from visiting the UK, after 574,000 people signed a petition. This followed his remarks calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US.It was argued that his presence would risk ""inflaming tensions between vulnerable communities"". But opponents of a ban said it would give Mr Trump ""the role of martyrdom"" and could mean ""shutting down an honest debate"" on immigration.News of the possible state visit came as Mr Obama - who had his farewell trip to Europe last week - said he would speak out about Mr Trump's presidency if he feels an issue ""goes to core questions about our values and our ideals"".US presidents tend to avoid criticising predecessors or successors. Mr Obama - who has previously been heavily criticised by Mr Trump and who had questioned his successor's suitability for high office - was clear that he would not weigh in on Mr Trump's decisions while he was still in power.Meanwhile, as the president-elect continues to select his leadership team, he has confirmed he is considering retired Marine Corps Gen James Mattis for the role of defence secretary, calling him ""very impressive"" in a tweet. He also met former critic Mitt Romney, who is now being considered for secretary of state.Congressman Mike Pompeo has been nominated as CIA director and retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn made national security adviser."

Thomas Mair watched the 41-second film of an American man shooting the .22 calibre gun on 7 June - nine days before Mrs Cox's murder, jurors heard.The jury was also told that Nazi-related material was found when police raided Mr Mair's home.The 53-year-old denies murdering Mrs Cox, 41, in Birstall, near Leeds.Mr Mair, from Birstall, also denies grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger. Earlier in the trial, the jury was shown an image of a sawn-off .22 Weihrauch bolt-action rifle, alleged to have been recovered when Mr Mair was arrested. They were told Mrs Cox's blood was on the barrel. The court heard on Monday that when police raided the defendant's home after his arrest they found an SS officer's book on race theory and mate selection, along with other white supremacist texts.  Officers also found a book entitled March of the Titans: The Complete History of the White Race and a book on the ""politics of the Holocaust"", among other texts. A press cutting in relation to Anders Brevik, who murdered 77 people in twin attacks in Norway in July 2011, was also found, the court heard.  The material featured in a series of photographs shown to jurors by prosecutor Richard Whittam.Jurors were also shown images of head and hand injuries sustained by Mr Mair during his arrest.Mr Mair had also allegedly collected a dossier on Mrs Cox in his home, including stories about her in newspapers.And he had a printout of Mrs Cox, who was MP for Batley and Spen and a mother of two, from her website, jurors were told.In the months before Mrs Cox's death, Mr Mair used computers at Birstall and Batley libraries to visit neo-Nazi websites such as the Daily Stormer, the court heard.The jurors were told Mr Mair also searched for Dylann Roof, who is accused of killing nine black Americans in South Carolina in 2015, and accessed the Wikipedia pages for politicians William Hague and Jo Cox, as well as the Wikipedia page for Ian Gow - an MP who who died when the IRA detonated a bomb under his car.Mr Mair's neighbour of 13 years, Katie Green, also gave evidence via video-link and said she saw the defendant on 16 June as she got off a bus in Birstall market place.She told jurors Mr Mair was ""very quiet, very shy but did not see any visitors"", and he always kept his garden very tidy and spent a lot of time in it.Mr Mair was ""at the front of the queue looking like he was just waiting to get on to the bus"", she said.""He had a pair of dark trousers and a dark green khaki jacket and dark cream baseball cap.""He always carried bags. He had three or four bags. I saw him walk off.""Ms Green said that she then heard about a gun incident minutes afterwards and decided to abandon her shopping trip.The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday morning."
2016-11-21,Wales 'not significantly underfunded',https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-38055455,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkWales is no longer ""significantly"" underfunded compared to England, according to the economist who led a review into the matter.In 2010, Prof Gerry Holtham said Wales was missing out under the Treasury's Barnett formula for setting grants across the UK nations.He told AMs on Monday that Welsh public spending had since risen from 112% of the English average to around 116%.It might be down to a lag in the way the formula works, he said. Claims that Wales has been underfunded by the UK Treasury have long dogged negotiations over the devolution of tax powers to Wales for fear that it would preserve an unfair settlement. The Holtham report in 2010 claimed Wales was losing out by about £300m a year through the use of a formula which did not fully take into account the cost of providing public services to a relatively older, poorer and less healthy population.  In November 2015 the then Chancellor George Osborne announced a funding floor that Welsh public spending per head would not fall below 115% of the figure for England. ""At the time we did the report in 2010 we were able to point to Wales getting 3% or 4% less than it should have been getting by the English comparison,"" Mr Holtham told the assembly's external affairs committee.""Nobody has wanted to update that work because they are all afraid of what it might show.""But as far as I can see, from a rather rough and ready updating of it, Wales is no longer significantly underfunded.""Mr Holtham also accused the Welsh Government of not having a strong enough economic strategy, saying ministers should focus on a smaller number of priority areas.""You cannot concentrate on nine sectors which make up 80% of the economy,"" he said.""That is diffusion not concentration.""He also warned that the UK government was unlikely to make up all the EU funding that Wales would lose after Brexit.He said the ""noises"" from Conservative ministers in Westminster were ""not entirely encouraging""."

They might be army officers. They might be doctors. They might be dentists. They might be business people.

Ros Altmann called on the government to use tax breaks to help people save for care in later life, as she said the cost of funding provision was pushing the NHS in England to breaking point.  She said she warned other ministers of looming problems last year.The Department of Health said it was significantly raising the funds local authorities have access to for care.Lady Altmann, who was pensions minister under David Cameron, said the chancellor should use Wednesday's Autumn Statement to offer incentives to help families ""recognise the need"" to prepare for care costs.  ""This should have been done years ago, but successive governments have failed to offer any help,"" she said.  ""Government spends billions on private pensions tax breaks, and there is a state pension to provide a base level of support, but there are no incentives to set money aside for care costs.""You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.

She suggests a new ISA to help people save for care could be introduced and firms could offer ""eldercare vouchers"" along the lines of the childcare voucher scheme, which attracts tax relief.NHS: Budget controlled by NHS England and pays for hospitals, GPs, district nursing and mental health care.

Lady Altmann told the BBC she had sent a memo around Whitehall when she was appointed after the May 2015 general election, warning that the issue of care costs could cause significant social and economic distress.The Department of Health said local authorities in England had been given powers to raise extra money for social care through higher council taxes, and other funding would be available from next April.A spokesman said: ""This government is committed to making sure older people throughout the country get affordable and dignified care. ""We are significantly increasing the amount of money local authorities have access to for social care, by up to £3.5bn by 2020.""Our care Act also introduced the biggest reforms to social care in over 65 years to make support more consistent across the country."""

2016-11-21,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-21,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-21,Business beat,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38057462,"There were no hecklers this year, more a respectful silence as the gathered audience listened to the big name.  And despite her talent for saying very little, and indeed, the prime minister's determination to give hardly anything away on her plans for Brexit, this morning at the CBI she did in the end say rather a lot. No surprises, when it comes to the big picture, the prime minister was abundantly clear (again) that she won't be pushed into giving more details of her plans for how we leave the EU and life afterward. That was despite the fact that she took to the stage moments after the CBI President who could not have been any clearer in making the organisation's demand for more information. It is five months since the referendum this week, but despite the growing pressure from business and in Westminster, she is not budging. The CBI, a lobby as powerful as they get, basically said, ""please, please, tell us what is going on"". Theresa May in response minutes later essentially said, ""not a chance"". But she did give some things away. While Downing Street denies it's a U-turn, the prime minister scotched any suggestion (including her own) that the government might make companies have workers sitting on their boards. One of the first proposals she made when she launched her bid to lead the country  was ""If I'm prime minister, we're going to change that system - and we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.""You wouldn't have been a fool for concluding that she meant that big firms would therefore have to have staff members on their boards. Not now, according to Downing Street. She said this morning that she never meant that firms would have to appoint workers directly to boards, although some companies may wish to do that.But there is no coincidence that the policy has undergone what you might politely call an evolution, after business was alarmed. Unions this afternoon have poked fun at what they see as a U-turn, the TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying ""If Mrs May says Brexit means Brexit, surely workers on boards means workers on boards"".The government is consulting on its plans. I understand the likely option is company boards to have one director whose sole responsibility is representing workers' views - we'll know in due course. The prime minister did recommit the government to the target of making British corporation tax - the tax on company profits - the lowest in the G20. It is scheduled to come down to 17 per cent in any case by the end of this Parliament. The trouble with her repeating the previous promise is that since it was made Donald Trump has emerged, with his promise to cut federal corporation tax to 15 per cent.It is not a direct comparison. But having said last night that the prime minister had to be taken at face value as she made that commitment, government sources today slapped it down with accusations of ""pure speculation"". But business leaders will have no doubt filed that promise away. Whether May meant it or not, she is on the record as making that promise, a fact not lost on the previous Chancellor, George Osborne, who made the 15 per cent proposal previously and was enjoying its re-emergence today.But what Theresa May did hint at today, and we are in the business of hunting for hints, was the possibility that there will be an interim agreement with the European Union to run after we leave, but before a final deal can be struck.This would risk the wrath of the Brexiteers. But while the specifics of a transitional agreement have not been discussed in Cabinet, one minister explained ""a reality check has started to happen"" and they suggested that a temporary deal ""may have to happen - it's a practical option"". No 10 sources are playing down the significance of today's comments with their familiar refrain - they're not ruling anything in, or anything out. But like the promise on corporation tax, that hint will be filed away by politicians on both sides - those who are looking to keep our ties to the EU as tight as possible, and those arguing for a fast, clean exit.  The relationship that Theresa May will have with the business community is one of the most important that she will have, particularly at a time of enormous political and economic uncertainty.Although business has welcomed her support and promises of extra government spending on research and development and infrastructure, they know that she is willing to criticise too - calling again for a minority of businesses who behave badly to get in line. One cabinet minister suggested that just as Tony Blair was willing to take on the unions, a Labour leader seeking to appeal to the centre by taking on his party's traditional supporters, Theresa May is keen to do the same, taking on business, a well of traditional Tory support. But these are early days, and probably not the last time Theresa May will stand on the CBI platform. So far there's a sense that they don't quite know what to make of her. And perhaps, she doesn't know quite what to make of them."
2016-11-21,Are you a JAM?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38049245,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government is expected to promise help for JAMs - those ""just about managing"" - in Wednesday's Autumn Statement. But who makes up this group?For former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the ""squeezed middle"" was a concern. Ex-Lib Dem leader and  Nick Clegg, while deputy prime minister, often referred to ""alarm clock Britain"" - the bleary-eyed grafters struggling to raise families, while getting out to work, with little money left over to pay for luxuries.Conservative Chancellor George Osborne concentrated on ""hard-working families"" - again, those not on huge wages, but juggling responsibilities and striving to keep going.This week, in his first Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne's successor Philip Hammond is expected to promise help for the group described by officials as JAMs, the households ""just about managing"" to avoid poverty - and feeling left behind by globalisation.Many consider themselves to be part of this demographic grouping, with wages having suffered since the financial crash, while house prices in many parts of the UK have risen and inflation has fluctuated.According to the Resolution Foundation think tank, those ""just managing"" - the insertion of the word ""about"" makes for a better acronym - are made up of six million working-age households on low to middle incomes. They are spread across ""areas as diverse as Pendle in Lancashire, Sandwell in the Midlands and North Devon"".Are you just about managing to get by? You can email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your experiences.JAM households have at least one person in work, but are half as likely to have a degree as the rest of the population. The Resolution Foundation says they are not always ""low-income"" households. Those making as much as £50,000 a year could be included, if they have several children to feed and clothe, it adds.Most of their incomes come from work, but they are often topped up by welfare support. In fact, JAMs account for two-thirds of all families with children receiving tax credits, the Resolution Foundation says.More than two thirds have less than a month's income's worth of savings.So, the argument goes, JAMs are especially vulnerable to weak income growth, rising costs and the freeze on working-age benefits until 2019.The Treasury does not have a formal, income-based definition of JAMs, but the government has provided some strong indications of its thinking.In her first statement as Prime Minister, Theresa May, attempted to reassure this group, saying: ""If you're from an ordinary working-class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don't always have job security. ""You have your own home, but you worry about paying a mortgage. You can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you're one of those families, if you're just managing, I want to address you directly.""Mr Hammond made similar sounds on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, saying he would support people ""who work hard and by and large do not feel that they are sharing in the prosperity that economic growth is bringing to the country"".The Resolution Foundation says home ownership among the ""just managing"" fell from 59% in 1995 to 26% last year, meaning that many more face paying rent into old age.The group's senior economic analyst, David Finch, has said: ""This switch from owning to renting means that 'just managing' families are now having to set aside a quarter of their income on housing. As a result they have suffered over a decade of lost income growth.""Many of the problems families face - from falling home ownership and disappearing career ladders - are very deep-rooted. Reversing these family misfortunes is a huge task, but the right one to focus on.""Mr Hammond has given away little of what his Autumn Statement will bring, although there is speculation he will freeze fuel duty.And it has been suggested the chancellor will cut air passenger duty to help offset the costs of overseas holidays, made more expensive since the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit referendum. Mr Hammond might offer help with savings, too, pundits say.Whatever happens on Wednesday, we are likely to be hearing a lot more talk about JAM households."
2016-11-21,Brexit clues?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38050098,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAmid the howling winds of a storm that came across the English channel at the weekend, a few hatches were being fastened down at the Treasury.The Chancellor Philip Hammond gave a round of interviews on Sunday morning adopting a cautious tone on the economic outlook.He spoke of slowing business investment, higher inflation, and ""eye-watering"" levels of government debt. It came ahead of his first major economic announcement - Wednesday's Autumn Statement.Mr Hammond reflected on some apparent ill-winds from the continent by saying that Brexit negotiations will bring ""an unprecedented level of uncertainty"".Commentators were predicting a slowing of economic growth, he said. All this provided the economic context - as he saw it - to the next in a series of crucial political events before the government pushes the EU exit button by April next year. The Autumn Statement will give us the first clues as to how ministers intend to steer the economy and the public finances into the start of the EU negotiation period.And it will come alongside an economic outlook from the government's tax and spending watchdog - the Office for Budget Responsibility - which will cover the period beyond Britain's planned exit from the EU. Besides the financial assessments, Mr Hammond has a political path to navigate strewn with trip hazards.First, he must decide how far he needs to mitigate any ""uncertainty"" ahead. During the summer the Treasury made it clear it was abandoning the tough spending rules imposed by George Osborne - which said that the government's books must be balanced by 2020. The Brexit vote had changed the circumstances, said Mr Hammond, so new fiscal rules were required to deal with the ""turbulence"" that might arrive. Some commentators speculated that a government spending splurge may be in the offing.But appearing to show too much ""stimulus"" may anger cabinet colleagues who argued hardest for Brexit - and who believe too much emphasis on risk and uncertainty can be self-fulfilling. Mr Hammond watched the events of the summer - when Brexiteers criticised the Bank of England for reacting too soon by cutting interest rates to record lows, when in their view the economic circumstances did not merit it. The mood music from the chancellor is certainly not at that pitch.He has spoken instead of the need for credibility in managing the public finances - code for keeping spending down. He dropped a hint that he is likely to stick to George Osborne's savings to Universal Credit and other welfare spending - a move that has been much criticised by Labour. But a retreat too far towards the tough fiscal rules adopted by his predecessor would leave him open to criticism from opposition parties.They would say the government had abandoned those it pledged to help who are 'just managing' to get by. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the fall in the value of the pound is likely to push up prices by around 2.5%, with food, fuel and clothing among the items worst affected. The chancellor knows the line he has to tread: Not overplaying the uncertainty yet showing support for voters likely to feel the squeeze; being seen to support investment and job creation but staying credible in managing the public finances. Meanwhile, the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday is likely to be pored over for any hints as to direction of travel on Brexit. The watchdog bases its five year outlook on stated government policy - but there has been very little detail of that around when it comes to the UK's potential negotiating stance. The signs so far are that the Treasury is attempting to shift the focus with press releases on funding tech and infrastructure, being a ""global leader"" for free trade and investment - making Britain ""match fit"" for life after Brexit. Labour is trying to carve out its point of difference by accusing Mr Hammond of being ""weak"" in refusing to abandon austerity completely. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell calls all this ""gimmicks and giveaways"" and says the Treasury should be spending significantly more on infrastructure and job creation. The party says it would put £500bn into such projects over 10 years, funded through borrowing, while balancing the books on ""day to day"" spending and taxation. The government calls this ""fantasy economics"". So expect a relatively low-key Autumn Statement - but one in whose finer details we may be able to glean more about the government's stance on Brexit, whatever the weather. "
2016-11-21,Avoiding a 'cliff edge',https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38059541,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkWhen Brexit talks formally begin, the UK will have two years to negotiate its departure from the EU.Ministers hope to have parallel talks about our future trading relationship during that period - but what happens if they take longer?To avoid a ""cliff-edge"" scenario, the chairman of the Brexit select committee in the Commons, Hilary Benn, is among those who has argued for a transitional agreement.What might that look like? One possibility would be for the UK to seek membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) like Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. That would allow the UK to trade goods and services freely with the EU in exchange for financial contributions and the continued acceptance of free movement of people.But it would take the UK out of the common agriculture and fisheries policies and the customs union, allowing it to strike its own trade deals with non-EU countries. To join the EEA, ministers would first need to apply for membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). At a meeting of EFTA countries in Geneva, the current chair, Iceland's foreign minister Lilja Alfredsdottir, told the BBC her country would be keen to see a UK membership application, even if only on a temporary basis.""From an Icelandic point of view, yes we would welcome that,"" she said, ""because I believe EFTA would be stronger with the UK inside"". Norway's trade minister, Monica Maeland, said there had been ""no signal"" from the UK that it would want to join EFTA. If the UK did submit an application, she said there would be a willingness in EFTA to discuss it. Ms Maeland also indicated that she had discussed the potential need for the UK to have transitional arrangements with Lord Price, who is a minister in Liam Fox's new Department for International Trade. ""That was something Price was talking about... what are we going to do in the meantime? So, we are hoping to discuss several solutions.""Yet the UK government has not yet formally acknowledged that forging new trading relationships might have to be achieved in phases. Downing Street declined to confirm if that's what the prime minister meant when she spoke of avoiding a ""cliff-edge"" in her address to the CBI. "

2016-11-21,Breitbart rising,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-38005983,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA once-fringe online news site has deep connections with Donald Trump and the UK Independence Party. So what's the story behind Breitbart?Just days after the US election, an ebullient Nigel Farage made his way to Trump Tower in New York - the first British politician to meet the president-elect.""We're just tourists!"" Farage joked to waiting reporters.By his side was his former aide and the London editor of Breitbart News, Raheem Kassam. And Kassam's ultimate boss, Stephen Bannon, has been lined up for a top White House job as Trump's chief strategist.Key figures at Breitbart News - a fast-growing conservative website that has been condemned by some commentators as racist and misogynist - are connected with both the Trump campaign and with the UK Independence Party. The White House was probably a distant dream when conservative entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart launched Breitbart.tv in 2007. It built on his earlier work for online outlets such as the conservative Drudge Report and liberal Huffington Post, along with an early iteration of his eponymous site which collected news links.The site first gained notoriety with videos targeting liberal groups and politicians. In 2011, it scored a major scoop when it exposed former Democratic congressman Anthony Wiener's sexting scandal.In 2012, Andrew Breitbart died of heart failure. Bannon became executive chairman.""The site used to be a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred conservative website that held liberals to account and resisted political correctness,"" says Jesse Singal, a writer-at-large with New York Magazine who's tussled with Breitbart in the past. ""They've turned much more extreme since Andrew Breitbart died.""From its base in California, the site has expanded, opening bureaus in Texas, Jerusalem and, in 2014, London. ""We look at London and Texas as two fronts in our current cultural and political war,"" Bannon said at the time.At the outset of the marathon US election campaign, the site initially seemed to back Texas Senator Ted Cruz.But a key moment came in March when Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, Trump's then campaign manager. Charges were filed but later dropped. After Fields was criticised - and Lewandowski defended - by some of her Breitbart colleagues, there were several resignations from the website.In August, Bannon was picked to lead Trump's campaign. It was a sign of the site's influence. Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart reporter whose beat was the Hillary Clinton campaign, says the site doesn't pretend to balance all sides of an issue.""The ethic of objectivity as it's traditionally formulated is not practised there,"" he says. However he defends the spin by saying the site is up-front about it. ""I never made any pretence about the fact that I did not want Hillary Clinton to be president.""Future expansion targets include France and Germany. ""Their model is to identify areas where there are two ingredients, the potential to exploit or inflame racial anxieties, anti-Muslim sentiment, anti-feminist sentiment,"" says Angelo Carusone, executive vice president of the left-wing think tank Media Matters. He predicts they will back the National Front in France. ""The second ingredient is a political opposition force that they can align with or consume to gain legitimacy.""In Britain, Carusone says, UKIP was that force.2007: Andrew Breitbart starts Breitbart.tv2011: Breitbart breaks the story of Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner's sex scandal2012: Andrew Breitbart dies; Stephen Bannon takes over as executive chairman2014: Breitbart opens a bureau in LondonMarch 2016: Trump's then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabs Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields at a rally. The resultant controversy leads several reporters and editors to resignAugust 2016: Bannon appointed Trump campaign chief executiveOctober 2016: Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam launches a bid for the UKIP leadership using the slogan ""Make UKIP Great Again"". He later withdraws13 November 2016: Following the election, Bannon is picked to be Trump's chief strategistIn the days since the election and Bannon's appointment, there's been a lot of coverage about the site's most provocative content, including a set of much-discussed headlines: This however is just one slice of Breitbart's output, which is a hodgepodge of factual stories provided by news wires, provocative opinion designed to infuriate liberals and whip up conservatives, cheerleading for Trump and right-wing ideas, and attack pieces on celebrities, journalists and other perceived enemies. The company produces videos, movies, radio shows and podcasts and has a huge social media presence.It's all presented in a tabloid style - and the site has no clear delineations between news, analysis, commentary and opinion. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Kassam described the site's style: ""Is it ugly? Yes. Is it varnished? No. But is it truthful? Absolutely.""Howley says the site's approach is straightforward. ""We are honest about it,"" he says. ""If you suspend objectivity you can build great sources and develop an audience and the information is all the same.""Howley, who says there is no written code of ethics or guidelines for Breitbart journalists, argues the site tapped into the ""populist side of the conservative movement which wasn't really represented in the press"". He resigned from Breitbart on election night, saying that the company had grown and changed substantially in his time there and that he was interested in other reporting projects.Editor-at-large Joel Pollak has denied the site is racist or sexist. The staff are ""happy warriors"", Pollak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Andrew Breitbart founded it to take on the mainstream media, to take on the institutional left and to take on the Republican Party establishment. There is in a sense a populist undercurrent in the website but that's not angry."" Over the last 18 months, Breitbart's fortunes have risen in line with Trump's. According to web analytics company Comscore, the site has added millions of readers since Donald Trump started his run to the presidency. Its monthly US audience is now more than 19 million, which puts it ahead of many mainstream news sites.In Britain it has a much narrower reach, even factoring in the UK's smaller population - Comscore puts its monthly unique users at under 700,000.If you visit the site and click around, you're just as likely to find straight news (""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on 'the twin interests of peace and security'"") as you are to see freewheeling pro-Trump hype (""It happened. We won! We now live in the Age of Daddy!"")In that respect, Breitbart is distinct from the ""fake news"" industry that received so much attention after the election. Critics note that its stories might be made up of facts, but spun and deployed hard against its main bugbears - including liberals, refugees (particularly from the Muslim world), and feminism. In August, the site published a story headlined ""TB spiked 500 percent in Twin Falls during 2012, as Chobani Yoghurt opened plant"".The story was one of several the site ran about a small city in Idaho and Chobani, one of America's leading yogurt brands. Chobani is owned by Hamdi Ulukaya, a billionaire immigrant from Turkey. Ulukaya has ties to President Obama and has employed refugees at his plants in Idaho and elsewhere.The story linked a rise in tuberculosis cases to the yogurt plant and refugees living locally.But there was more to the story. The ""500 percent"" spike in the headline represented an increase from one case - to six. Those six cases, according to Tom Shanahan of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, were all diagnosed prior to the Chobani plant opening in December 2012.By 2015, the number of cases was back down to just one. Shanahan says that the Breitbart story was ""misleading"", that the tuberculosis spike was not statistically significant and that it could not be linked to the yogurt plant or refugees in the area. In the UK, following the EU referendum in June, several stories on the site poked holes in a reports which suggested that hate crimes had spiked by 57%.The cause and effect around current events and hate crimes is complicated and awareness of how to report them boosts statistics. However there was no mention on Breitbart of later analysis by the Home Office which showed a 41% rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote. ""It's a more radical Fox News. It's living in a different world, a much more fearful world, where rumour and innuendo are passed around as fact,"" says Singal. Breitbart also runs sharply critical stories on other journalists and news outlets and mocks reporters who complain about trolls and slurs. ""Every special snowflake reporter with a Twitter account wanted in on the sweet victimhood action,"" taunted one writer, criticising journalists who found themselves being shouted at by Trump supporters at campaign rallies.Mainstream media reporters who have been the subject of Breitbart pieces have at times found themselves on the receiving end of online trolling. The BBC has spoken to several who have had rape and death threats against themselves and their families, and several from news outlets in the US and the UK said they or their colleagues have been cautious about writing about the site for fear of the resultant backlash.There's no implication that Breitbart reporters or employees are directing the trolling or participating in it themselves. (Although one Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, was banned from Twitter for firing off unpleasant messages to actress Leslie Jones.) And Breitbart is far from the only news source to whip its audience into action. At the same time the company and its journalists don't hesitate to complain about alleged abuse against themselves.Stephen Bannon: Breitbart's executive chairman, he left to run the Trump campaign and has been lined up for a job as senior strategist in the Trump White House. In a rare speech in 2014, he had words of praise for UKIPNigel Farage: The UKIP leader is a regular Breitbart columnistRaheem Kassam: Hired by Bannon to be Breitbart's London editor, he was a chief adviser to Farage during the 2015 general election, and briefly ran for UKIP leader himself before dropping outRobert Mercer: A Breitbart funder and investor in Cambridge Analytica, the data firm used by EU referendum Leave campaigners and the Trump campaign. His daughter, Rebekah Mercer, is part of Trump's transition teamArron Banks: This major UKIP donor backed Kassam's leadership bid and bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign, enlisting the help of Cambridge AnalyticaRaheem Kassam, the site's London editor, made a brief run for UKIP leader. After dropping out of the race, Kassam said he would pursue a harassment case against journalists from the Times, claiming they intimidated his parents in the course of writing a profile on him. The Times characterised the encounter as a ""short, polite conversation with a family member"" in the course of ""standard reporting practice"".The site, which frequently argues in favour of free speech, has vowed to sue an unnamed media outlet for calling it a ""white nationalist"" website. Thus far, no legal action has commenced. Breitbart's funding sources are somewhat obscure. As a private company, Breitbart has declined to reveal its investors or how it makes money. In 2014, before its overseas expansion, Bannon said that the site wasn't quite profitable. There are ads on the site and it also sells merchandise such as campaign coffee cups.It has been reported that the company has been funded by Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund manager who is the founder of Cambridge Analytica, a data firm which worked for the Leave.EU campaign as well as Trump's bid for the White House.  Mercer's daughter Rebekah is part of Trump's transition team. Another big Leave.EU backer was UKIP donor Arron Banks, who accompanied Farage and Kassam to Trump Tower. In Washington, the big question people have been asking about Bannon is how he will act in the Trump administration, and what the role of Breitbart will be once he's there. Prior to the election, Bannon said he would return to the company - but that was before Trump's victory and his White House appointment. Under ethics rules, Bannon has 30 days from taking office in January to declare his financial ties to Breitbart.Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who resigned after the Fields incident, says in his view the site's function won't change when Trump becomes president.""It will be the propaganda arm of the administration,"" he says. ""Their mandate is to create conflict, controversy and divisiveness - as well as propping up President Trump,"" he says. But conservative journalist Cathy Young, who clashed with Breitbart after denouncing what she saw as the site's whitewashing of the extremist alt-right, argues that those might take a back seat to a more pragmatic political style.""My guess would be that Bannon will be less of a champion of the alt-right than a political pit bull who will use whatever weapon he can to pursue the victory of the person he's promoting.""For his part, Farage has offered to act as a conduit between the US and the UK - a proposal that Downing Street quickly rebuffed.  Breitbart did not respond to requests to comment for this story, and several reporters and staff members also did not respond to questions. Carusone, from Media Matters, thinks that calling Breitbart ""propaganda"" slightly misstates its role, and says its real function in a Trump White House could be to shore up support on the far right. ""There's been a consensus in some parts of the media that Trump is softening on some of his policies,"" he says. ""Part of the role of Breitbart will be to give a wink and a nod to Trump's most fervent supporters to let them know he's still on their side.""Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter"

2016-11-21,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122003029/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-22,Hammond plans 'to boost wages and homes',https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38068358,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkMeasures aimed at boosting workers' wages and increasing housebuilding are expected in Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement on Wednesday.The first major economic statement since the Brexit vote will also unveil forecasts which are expected to show higher borrowing and slower growth.Mr Hammond has warned of ""turbulence"" and ""an unprecedented level of uncertainty"" as the UK leaves the EU.Labour predicted he would fail to help people on low and middle incomes.The Autumn Statement, Mr Hammond's first major address as chancellor, takes place at about 12:30 GMT, after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons.Among the measures to be announced are:Already-announced measures include investing an extra £2bn a year in science by 2020, a crackdown on compensation claims for whiplash injuries aimed at reducing motorists' insurance premiums and £1.3bn to improve roads.The government has also faced calls to abandon planned cuts to Universal Credit, due to come into force in April 2017, which critics say will hit people who are ""just about managing"" - the group Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to protect.The Office for Budget Responsibility will publish its estimates for the country's economic growth and the government's finances as soon as Mr Hammond finishes making his speech.""The chancellor has got a very difficult task,"" Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said.""For sure the economic numbers are going to get worse - he's going to be borrowing more than he wanted to and he is going to be very uncertain about exactly where we will be in four or five years' time.""Mr Hammond received a boost on Tuesday as official figures showed the government borrowed a lower-than-expected £4.8bn last month.Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorPhilip Hammond looked relaxed in a photo released by the Treasury - reading his statement, settled in a wing-backed chair, tea in a china cup and saucer at hand.But while he is perfectly at home in the Treasury, the government has little to be relaxed about. As a new team, in Number 11 and Number 10, there is a clear political desire to show Theresa May means it when she promises to help families struggling to make ends meet.But one Cabinet source said there was even less money than in 2010, when there famously was ""no money left"".There may be concessions to some, but don't expect any largesse.Despite the change in personnel and a willingness to borrow a fraction more, this is still a Tory administration determined to pare back public spending.With the Treasury belief that the question marks of Brexit make that task even harder, Mr Hammond will pursue caution over flashing taxpayers' cash.Read more from LauraDespite this he is expected to announce an extra £100bn of public borrowing for the next five years, compared with what was planned in March - largely because the economy is expected to grow less quickly than had been thought.In the build-up to his statement, the chancellor has vowed to ensure the UK economy is ""watertight"" for the ""sharp challenges"" of Brexit and described the UK's debt - national debt stands at £1.6trn - as ""eye-wateringly"" large.The government said Mr Hammond's proposals would ""support ordinary working class families"".They include changes to Universal Credit - the flagship single payment being rolled out across the UK - to reduce the ""taper rate"" from 65% to 63%. This means benefits will be withdrawn at a rate of 63p for every pound of net earnings.The government said about three million households would benefit.But the Resolution Foundation think tank said their gains would be ""small fry"" compared with previously-announced cuts to the work allowance, which is the amount people can earn before they start to lose their benefits.On housing, the government said it would relax rules on how affordable housing funding could be used and promised additional measures in the Autumn Statement.It said banning letting agents' fees would help 4.3 million private rental tenants.Citizens Advice welcomed measures on the agents' fees and on workers' wages.However, chief executive Gillian Guy added: ""There is still room to go further in helping 'just managing families'; like looking at the cost of energy bills.""And there are changes government could look at which don't cost any money, such as asking councils to review their debt collection practices to make sure people who can't pay their bills aren't pushed further into debt.""Labour, which has been calling for agents' fees to be banned, said: ""Any change of heart is welcome"" but added that the government had ""no plan"" to fix the housing crisis.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the reduction in the Universal Credit taper rate would be ""too little, too late for those working families who have had to bear the brunt of six wasted years of failed Tory economic policies"".""Despite all their rhetoric last month, and before the ink is even dry on the Autumn Statement, it looks like it will be jam tomorrow for working people under Theresa May and Philip Hammond.""The SNP said the biggest threat to the economy was ""uncertainty caused by this UK government and the threat of a Tory hard Brexit""."
2016-11-22,Farage attacks No 10 after Trump backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38064664,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNigel Farage has accused Downing Street of putting its dislike of him ahead of the national interest after No 10 dismissed Donald Trump's comment that he could be a ""great"" ambassador.The UKIP leader said No 10 needed to accept ""the world has changed"", adding he was ""in a good position, with the president-elect's support, to help"".Mr Trump had tweeted that ""many people"" would like to see Mr Farage in the role and he would do a ""great job"".But No 10 said there was ""no vacancy"".The role is currently held by Sir Kim Darroch and a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May added that he was ""an excellent ambassador who only took up post in January and traditionally they serve four years or even longer"". Mr Farage, who is currently UKIP interim leader, was the first British politician to meet Mr Trump after his victory in the US presidential elections and spoke in support of him at an election rally. Writing for Breitbart website, whose former executive chairman Stephen Bannon has been appointed Mr Trump's chief strategist, he said: ""At every stage I am greeted by negative comments coming out of Downing Street. ""The dislike of me, UKIP, and the referendum result is more important to them than what could be good for our country.""Mr Farage said politicians who had been ""openly abusive about Trump now pretend to be his friend"".He wrote: ""It is career politics at its worst and it is now getting in the way of the national interest.""I have said since the now famous photograph with Donald Trump 10 days ago that I would do anything to help our national interest and to help cement ties with the incoming Anglophile administration.""I have known several of the Trump team for years and I am in a good position with the president-elect's support to help. The world has changed and it's time that Downing Street did too.""By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editorBy any measure this is an extraordinary intervention. The future head of state of one nation telling another country who they should appoint as their ambassador is unusual enough; when it is two nations that are meant to share a special relationship it is a breach of nearly every rule of diplomatic protocol. At a stroke it puts tension into the Trump/ May relationship before they have even met. It also leaves the current holder of the post, Sir Kim Darroch, in an awkward position as he seeks to forge closer contacts with the new administration. In Downing Street and diplomatic circles there is consternation. But for Nigel Farage - who has always delighted in tweaking the tail of the Conservative Party - there will be amusement, and it seems in the future leader of the most powerful nation on earth he has a willing partner. Since Mr Trump's election there has been an anticipation that the rule book might not be followed. Few anticipated this though.The president-elect's meeting with Mr Farage was seen by some as a snub to Mrs May, who will not meet Mr Trump until early next year.Mr Trump has spoken to the prime minister by phone and there have been other contacts between British ministers and representatives of the incoming administration.The Downing Street spokesman said the UK already had ""an incredibly strong and enduring relationship with America"" and the government would build on that once Mr Trump takes office.  ""As a basic principle we appoint our ambassadors,"" he added.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson reiterated that there was ""no vacancy"".Speaking in the House of Commons, he said: ""We have a first-rate ambassador in Washington doing a very good job of relating both with the present administration and the administration to be and there is no vacancy for that position.""Sir Christopher Meyer, the former UK ambassador to the US, told the BBC: ""We the UK must have the sovereign right to decide who we want as ambassador in Washington and I think it's completely unprecedented, certainly in public, for a president-elect to suggest who he would like to see as British ambassador in Washington.""I think we can hear his suggestion and then we reject it politely but firmly.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron tweeted that the suggestion of Mr Farage as UK ambassador to the US was a ""frankly stupid idea"". He added: ""I have more diplomacy in my little finger. But what's more worrying is the axing of TPP.""Mr Farron was referring to Mr Trump's announcement that he would quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on his first day in office. "
2016-11-22,Davis: EU Brexit meeting 'good start',https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38061035,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkBrexit Secretary David Davis has described his meeting with the European Parliament's chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt as a ""good start"".Although they could not negotiate yet, he said their discussions had been able to cover structures and how both sides propose to approach the Brexit talks.He said a deal was possible that was in the interests of the EU and the UK. Mr Verhofstadt said he wanted an exit deal completed before the next European Parliament elections in 2019.Ahead of their talks the two men laughed off an apparent misunderstanding over Mr Davis's comment - ""get thee behind me Satan"" - in September when answering a Commons committee question about Mr Verhofstadt.Mr Verhofstadt was referring to that when he said he was looking forward to a ""hell of a conversation"".But ahead of the meeting Mr Davis said his Satan reference was to the person trying to tempt him to comment on Mr Verhofstadt, rather than directed at the former Belgian prime minister.The European Parliament has to vote on, and could therefore veto, both the terms of the UK's exit and the even bigger subsequent deal to establish Britain's future relationship with the EU.After the meeting Mr Davis called Mr Verhofstadt ""a very nice man"" and said that although they could not go into the details of negotiations they could lay the ground work for how the process might work.BBC Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas said that how the two men get on could play an important role in the success of the Brexit negotiations - which are due to begin after Theresa May triggers the official two-year process in March.The heart of the negotiations is likely to be the balance between UK firms being able to trade freely within the European single market, and the UK's desire to end the right of all EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP, the largest grouping in the European Parliament, also had talks with Mr Davis and said that the free movement of people was non-negotiable. He said: ""We need to take into account the interests of 450 million European citizens... What we really expect are clear proposals. ""Today, in my talk with David Davis, unfortunately I haven't really heard anything new. I haven't really heard how the British government want to tackle Brexit or what Brexit really means."" But Mr Davis said: ""Our view is that we can get an outcome which will be in the interests of the European Union and in the interests of Britain and which will meet the requirements of the referendum. All of those are possible. That's what the negotiations are about.""Mr Verhofstadt said: ""In the meeting I repeated what are, for us, essential key points. That is, that... these negotiations, in the interest of everybody, need to be concluded before the European elections. ""We cannot imagine, or at least it would be very strange, if the UK have to organise elections for the UK parliament after the outcome of the Brexit vote. And it gives us the possibility  of a fresh and new start with new people."""
2016-11-22,Jo Cox jury urged to put emotions aside,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38064407,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe murder of Labour MP Jo Cox touched hundreds, if not thousands of people, but jurors needed to try the accused without emotion, a court has heard.Thomas Mair, 53, is accused of shooting and stabbing the mother-of-two in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June, a week before the EU referendum vote.At his trial, Mr Mair chose not to give any evidence in his defence.Simon Russell Flint QC, defending, said Mr Mair - who denies murder - had no previous convictions or cautions.""You and you alone will determine whether Thomas Mair can return to his quiet and solitary existence or will be forever remembered as the man who assassinated Jo Cox,"" he told the Old Bailey jury.Mr Mair also denies grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger.On Tuesday, the court heard from 41-year-old Mrs Cox's close friend and colleague Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who said it had been a dream come true for Mrs Cox - MP for Batley and Spen - to stand for her local area.In a statement read out in court, he said she would talk about the joy of representing a diverse community.He described her as an internationalist, who saw the world as being very small.Her priority was the poor and dispossessed, he said, and she had no interest in party political point scoring.The last time he saw her was a week before her death at a party on her houseboat, the court heard.She was incredibly well-liked and popular, and always found time for people, he added.Jurors also heard that Mr Mair said in his first court appearance ""death to traitors - freedom for Britain"" when asked his name.In his closing speech, prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said the evidence was compelling that Mr Mair had murdered Mrs Cox outside Birstall library as constituents waited to speak to her.He said she was most likely shot once in the head with a sawn-off rifle, then stabbed with a dagger. Despite having the ""element of surprise"", Mr Mair failed in his first attempt and returned to shoot and stab Mrs Cox once more, the court heard.Mr Whittam said: ""Perhaps he underestimated Jo Cox's tenacity and courage.""Mr Whittam returned to evidence from one of Mrs Cox's aides, Fazila Aswat, who told the trial the man had said ""Britain first"" as he carried out the attack. Ms Aswat described cradling Mrs Cox's head in her lap as the MP urged her and another colleague to ""get away - let him hurt me, not you"".Mr Whittam told the jury: ""The sheer barbarity of her murder and the utter cowardice of her murder bring the two extremities of humanity face to face.""He said the attack had brought out the best in people, including 77-year-old Bernard Kenny who was wounded trying to help Mrs Cox and people in a cake shop who attempted CPR to try to save her. He submitted that Mr Mair's defence counsel did not have enough substance to dent the prosecution case.A blood spot from Jo Cox was found on the gun, he said, and the dagger also had DNA associated with Mr Mair and Mrs Cox on it.Addressing the jury, Mr Whittam said Mr Mair was entitled to ""sit back and say nothing"" but the weight of the evidence was obvious.""You have no denial. He has not given evidence to say he is not the murderer,"" he told them.Simon Russell Flint QC, in his closing speech for the defence, said Mrs Cox's death had ""touched many hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people"" and many of her friends, colleagues and family would be ""forever scarred"".He said Mr Kenny, a ""brave and courageous gentleman"" who sought to prevent the attack, would ""forever be affected"".But he urged the jury to try Mr Mair without emotion, however ""distressing, disturbing and tragic"" the case had been.Mrs Cox's widower Brendan joined his late wife's family in court for the judge's summing-up on Tuesday afternoon.Mr Justice Wilkie said it was the defendant's right not to give evidence and warned the jury not to assume he was guilty.He said Mr Mair was a man of good character which might mean he was less likely to commit the crime, but it was up to the jury to decide how much weight to give that.He said it was also their job to decide whether comments of ""It's me"" and ""I'm a political activist"" made to two police officers were a confession, as the prosecution had claimed.The trial continues."

It is a question of fairness, of respect. When you want to leave a club, you have no say any more in the long-term future of this club.""Mr Johnson has also faced criticism from other EU member states for comments last week that have been interpreted by some as wanting the UK to stay in the single market while also being able to curb the free movement right of all EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Asked about the state of Brexit talks, at Foreign Office questions on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said Theresa May had set out very clearly ""what we hope to achieve"" and that the plan was ""eminently achievable"".He said: ""More and more of our friends and partners around the EU are seeing the merits of what is being proposed. More and more are excited. And relations, I can tell you, relations are excellent and are getting warmer. Not just in the EU but around the world.""On Tuesday, Mr Weber also met the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, for an introductory meeting ahead of the formal negotiations set to begin when Theresa May triggers the two-year UK  exit process in March.Mr Davis described his meeting with Mr Weber and the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, as a ""good start"" and spoke of his hope of a Brexit deal that suited the EU, the UK and also met the referendum ""requirements"", which was taken as meaning curbs on immigration.But Mr Weber was less enthusiastic, saying that free movement of people was not negotiable, adding: ""Today, in my talk with David Davis, unfortunately I haven't really heard anything new. I haven't really heard how the British government want to tackle Brexit or what Brexit really means.""Mr Verhofstadt also tweeted a warning that the EU's values were being threatened from within by ""cronies"" of President Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President-elect Donald Trump. ""Let's not allow this happen. Let's fight back,"" he said.It appeared to be a reference, in part, to UK Independence Party interim leader Nigel Farage, who has spoken admiringly about Mr Putin. Mr Farage is also close to Mr Trump and his entourage.On Monday, Mr Trump controversially suggested that Mr Farage - a leading Brexiteer - should be appointed UK ambassador to the US. The UK government has dismissed the suggestion."
2016-11-22,UK borrowing falls thanks to tax income,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38062164,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkGovernment borrowing fell by more than expected to £4.8bn in October, thanks to a record amount of tax income for that month, official figures show.The amount borrowed was £1.6bn lower than for the same month last year.From April to October, the financial year to date, borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell by £5.6bn to £48.6bn, the lowest for the first seven months of a tax year since 2008.The figures come a day ahead of the Autumn Statement on Wednesday. Economists had expected borrowing to come in at £6bn last month.Overall tax income in October was the highest since records began, driven in part by a 23.6% jump in corporation tax receipts.Despite the monthly improvement, on Wednesday the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to announce an extra £100bn of public borrowing for the next five years, compared with what was planned in March, largely because the economy is expected to grow less quickly than had been thought. Public sector net debt - excluding the taxpayer-backed banks - was £1.6 trillion, equivalent to 83.8% of GDP and an increase of £50.9bn compared to October last year.Mr Hammond has already indicated that he will ""reset"" the UK's post-Brexit economic policy away from his predecessor George Osborne's aim of taking the government from a deficit to a surplus by 2020.Instead, he plans to put more investment into areas such as infrastructure. Despite October's improvement, Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it doesn't compensate for the weak start to the year: ""The higher-than-expected starting point for borrowing this year and weaker projections for GDP growth will compel the OBR to revise up sharply its forecast for borrowing in future years. ""The chancellor's warning at the weekend that he is 'highly constrained' suggests that there will be few sweeteners for the 'JAMs'—people 'just about managing'—in tomorrow's Autumn Statement."" British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) head of economics Suren Thiru also said the size of the UK's budget deficit could limit the scope for growth-boosting measures in the Autumn Statement.""The chancellor faces a major fiscal headache over the next few years, with slower than expected growth likely to further restrict the UK's ability to generate sufficient tax revenue and achieve a substantial reduction in the deficit.""It is therefore essential that the chancellor's new fiscal plan is flexible enough to adapt to changing economic conditions. The government must make a distinction between borrowing to cover the deficit and borrowing to invest, particularly in infrastructure, which will boost the economy's tax generating potential in the long-term,"" he added."

The president-elect is said to have spoken out when the two men met in New York last week.Leave EU campaigner Andy Wigmore, who was at the meeting, said Mr Trump was ""offended"" by wind turbines.Mr Trump fought against an offshore wind project near his Aberdeenshire golf resort.But Mr Wigmore said the entrepreneur had urged him and Mr Farage, the interim UKIP leader, to ""campaign against getting rid of wind farms in the way they currently stand"" and to instead ""get them offshore"".Mr Wigmore said: ""He has got a bugbear - he doesn't like wind farms at all. He says 'when I look out of my window and I see these windmills, it offends me. You've got to do something about these windmills. Let's put them offshore, why spoil the beautiful countryside?'""He also said Mr Trump had described Scotland as the ""most beautiful country ever"", but that he did not want it to be ""sullied by these awful windmills"".Last December the Supreme Court rejected Mr Trump's challenge to the offshore wind farm project near his Menie golf resort.His company the Trump Organisation previously lost two legal bids in the Scottish courts after ministers approved proposals for an 11-turbine scheme which Mr Trump said would spoil the view from his course.He took his case to the Supreme Court, where justices unanimously dismissed his appeal.Commenting on the recent discussion about wind farms, WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: ""One would have thought Mr Trump would have far more important issues to be dealing with.""The reality is that offshore wind turbines are already making a significant contribution to the UK's power supply. And, given that Scotland is home to a quarter of Europe's offshore wind resource, we should be aiming to make the most of this clean power source."""

""The expenditure linked to the services of three consultants was considered non-eligible by an external auditor and by the Parliament's administration.""When the European Parliament allegations first emerged last week, a spokesman for the ADDE group accused the parliament of ""harassment"", with UKIP MEP Roger Helmer adding: ""Call it revenge for Brexit if you like.""BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood the Electoral Commission inquiry related to whether UKIP spent some of the European money on the Brexit referendum.UKIP would face a possible fine up to £20,000 if it was judged to have accepted ""impermissible donations""."
2016-11-22,Proof of ID may be needed for NHS care,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38060432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this link Patients may have to show two forms of identification to get some NHS care, the senior civil servant at the Department of Health has said.Chris Wormald told a Commons committee it was a controversial move but already happened in some NHS trusts.The NHS has ""a lot further to go"" in reclaiming money for treating foreign visitors, he said.Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier raised concerns that some British residents might not have passports or other ID.Head of the BMA council Dr Mark Porter said the discussions were a distraction given that so-called health tourism was ""such a small problem"" for the NHS.NHS Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs from overseas patients.But this does not always happen. The government estimates £2bn a year is spent on treating overseas visitors - and only about £280m of this is thought to be deliberate health tourism whereby people come from abroad specifically to get free treatment they are not entitled to. The figure includes the cost of GP care, emergency treatment and routine hospital services, such as scans, maternity care and non-emergency operations.The government has focused on recouping money on routine hospital care. It set a target of recovering £500m a year by 2017-18, but is behind schedule.In 2014-15, when it set the goal, the NHS recovered just £97m.A year later that had increased to £289m, but most of that - £164m - came from the introduction of health surcharge on visa applications of £150 for students and £200 for other people. This entitles them to free NHS care.However, hospitals have struggled to significantly increase the amount they recover from patients they should be charging. UK residents and asylum seekers are entitled to free treatment. But the governments of patients from within the European Economic Area should be charged for the treatment they receive, while visitors from outside that area should be charged personally if they have not paid the surcharge.St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, is currently running a pilot scheme to test new proof-of-ID processes to recoup costs from pregnant overseas patients.Mr Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, which is responsible for the NHS in England, told the Public Accounts Committee: ""We have some trusts that are looking at asking for two forms of ID before treatment.""Now that is obviously quite a controversial thing to do but... those are the kinds of things we want to look at.""We don't have evaluated results of those yet, but what those trusts are reporting is that does lead to an increase in identification.""He added: ""There are individual trusts like Peterborough who are doing that, who are reporting that it makes a big difference and there you are saying, 'Please come with two forms of identity, your passport and your address,' and they use that to check whether people are eligible or not.""Now it is obviously quite a controversial thing to do to say to the entire population, 'You now have to prove identity.'""But Ms Hillier said she had constituents who had no photo ID.She said: ""Because they have never travelled, they have no passport; they have no driver's licence because they have never driven, they still live at home because they can't afford to move out so they've never had a utility bill in their name.""Perfectly entitled to health care, British born, British resident; how are you going to make sure that people have access easily to the National Health Service without having to go through a very humiliating and impossible-to-meet set of demands?""Mr Wormald responded: ""This is why we are going very slowly on some of these questions and individual trusts are trying these out.""Dr  Porter told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Why are we discussing this today?  We've got an Autumn Statement tomorrow, we've got an NHS with a deficit opening up over the course of this Parliament because of the funding decisions taken about how to address resources in the NHS. ""This is little other than a pinprick on the top of the actual problems facing the NHS.""A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The NHS is a national - not an international - health service and we are determined to stamp out abuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country. ""We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS. We will set out further steps in due course.""Do you live in an area where ID has to be provided in order to receive NHS treatment? Let us know about your experiences.

""Of course some of the groups are saying 'are these mistakes being made on purpose?'""The inquiry can expect more attention later this week when correspondence between the Home Affairs Select Committee and some of the inquiry's former lawyers is published. Newsnight understands that the inquiry told the lawyers not to engage with the Committee. Hugh Davies QC - deputy counsel to the inquiry (December 2015)Toby Fisher - joint first junior counsel to the inquiry (August 2015)Elizabeth Prochaska - joint first junior counsel to the inquiry (September 2016)Ben Emmerson QC - lead counsel on the inquiry (September 2016)Aileen McColgan - lead barrister on inquiry investigations into the Anglican and Catholic churches (November 2016)However, it understood the inquiry's former deputy chief counsel, Hugh Davies, is highly critical of the its handling of an alleged incident of sexual assault of a staff member by the former lead counsel, Ben Emmerson.Last month Newsnight reported that the alleged incident had been disclosed to the panel which oversees the inquiry but Mr Emmerson was allowed to resign with no investigation of the allegation, or any other concerns.Mr Emmerson has robustly denied that he sexually assaulted a colleague, or any other improper behaviour.The inquiry has denied that it received any complaint about a sexual assault, although it has not commented on whether it was notified of an alleged incident.Mr Mansfield said the best way of saving the inquiry was to have ""a panel of chairs, maybe half a dozen, with at least two lawyers in there, teams of lawyers doing different modules, dealing with different areas including different geographical areas as well as historical periods"".However he said it was not clear whether the inquiry could be rescued: ""All we get are assurances that it's going to be all right on the night. Well I'm afraid I don't accept that.""It looks extremely bad from outside and I can't see it ploughing on without the main actor [the victims]. This is Hamlet without Hamlet.""The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse said: ""It would not be appropriate for us to comment on Home Affairs Committee business.""Jake Morris was reporting for BBC Newsnight - you can watch his report here"

She ""clarified"" that she wanted to see workers' representation on boards and said there were a number of ways that could be achieved.

2016-11-22,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-22,Sitting comfortably?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38073093,"Philip Hammond looked relaxed in a photo released by the Treasury - reading his statement, settled in a wing-backed chair, tea in a china cup and saucer at hand.But while he is perfectly at home in the Treasury, the government has little to be relaxed about. As a new team, in Number 11 and Number 10, there is a clear political desire to show Theresa May means it when she promises to help families struggling to make ends meet.But one Cabinet source said there is even less money than in 2010, when there famously was ""no money left"".There may be concessions to some, but don't expect any largesse.Despite the change in personnel and a willingness to borrow a fraction more, this is still a Tory administration determined to pare back public spending.With the Treasury belief that the question marks of Brexit make that task even harder, Mr Hammond will pursue caution over flashing taxpayers' cash.This is still a big moment for the government - its first grand set piece financial statement.But the sense of occasion may be muted, given the chancellor's character. As one cabinet minister noted, he is unlike George Osborne as he is without ""imperial ambitions"".He does not have an eye on the job next door. So compared with recent statements it may be less grand in ambition, with less direct detail of how government should behave and spend.But in no way does that mean the task Mr Hammond has ahead is any less enormous. With the uncertainties of leaving the EU, perhaps the challenge for the 2016 Treasury is greater still."
2016-11-22,Meeting the Jams,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38046784,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkYou could argue that Britain as a nation has something in common with the Jams - the new acronym of choice in Downing Street. People who are Just About Managing - the people that the prime minister says she will help. Listen to the chancellor. The UK's debt is ""eye-wateringly"" large, he says. There are ""sharp"" challenges ahead and inflation is expected to rise next year. Some might say that Britain is itself just about managing.Marine engineer Christopher Harroway is already noticing a rise in the cost of living. ""You realise from daily activities like going to do your shopping, fuel prices, everything, that it's a lot higher than it used to be,"" he says. ""A lot of people's wages don't match that as much now.""Life's hard at times, but I suppose you get by.""Christopher works at Dunston's Ship Repairs in Hull, where he has been employed for 12 years. He hopes to buy a house in the next few years, but he knows the mortgage will be higher than his rent is currently. He, like many others, would appreciate some government help to bridge the gap. When the chancellor unveils his Autumn Statement on Wednesday we will get our first, proper detailed look at the policies this government wishes to pursue, its priorities. We know - because the prime minister tells us - that ministers are determined to make the lives of the Jams better. But there is limited money available to help voters left behind by globalisation, those whose living standards could be further eroded next year by falling growth and rising prices. Outside Dunston's, another ship is preparing to leave, as the sun starts to rise over the Humber, and more vessels are coming into port. People have struggled in Hull for decades, but now lives are improving after a huge effort to rebuild the economy around the renewable energy sector. ""We're very much on the right trajectory for the first time in something like 35 years. Our unemployment is at record lows,"" says Mark Jones, the man who led Hull's regeneration at a time of central government cuts to local authority budgets.""The government is short of money, we know that. We are heading towards more fiscal devolution.""You overcome this, he says, by creating money locally - a fiscal base for the council. ""Having more buildings, more productive assets, a better public realm that attracts more investment, more business rates into the area which can help sustain some of our more disadvantaged communities.""If the government is to be successful in improving lives, it will surely need the help of local authorities like Hull.Across Yorkshire in a chilly Victorian factory building in Sheffield, Pippa Elliot is standing on a stool, firing thick black wool into a rug base.She set up her business recently and says there needs to be ""help for start-up businesses. I know the funding's disappeared. I've taken my savings and supported myself. If I wasn't in that position I wouldn't have done it"". Outside and down some slippery stairs the old brick chimney still stands proud above the site at Portland Works. This is where the world's first stainless steel was produced more than 100 years ago.  Pete Ledger at PML Silver Plating walks past with dozens of shiny forks and spoons dangling from lengths of wire. In the office, his daughter Emma Lawson - who is the company secretary but who ends up doing ""everything"", she says with a laugh - would like more help from government to bring an apprentice into the family business.""It would be nice to have some help as to how to employ someone in the industry,"" says Emma. ""I don't actually think there's anything out there. That would be beneficial."" Finally we head into the forge, in the same building, where Andy Cole, the only forger left, says: ""You've got to slow imports down. In 2011 - up to then - I had 12 employees, but the (cheap) imports crippled me and I had to shut the doors. ""We need some sort of trade barriers to cushion our employees."" On the dockside in Liverpool, Gary's Cafe is doing a good trade - like the city itself. Just as in Hull, Liverpool was depressed for many years but it has been attracting investment recently and improving many lives.  Gary, who owns the mobile cafe and has been operating on the same street corner for 29 years has seen the ups, the downs and now the ups again. ""I'm getting a bit of a better living,"" he says, handing over a cup of tea. ""Scouse hospitality."" But the government should ""give us some more money - help the council along - because to be honest the city council are so stretched"". That plea is likely to fall on deaf ears in the Treasury. The wish lists of those who are managing to get by are long and detailed. The chancellor has said that funding is not limitless and that choices have to be made. He will not be able to help everyone.   "
2016-11-22,'Farage for Washington',https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38062580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUS President-elect Donald Trump has suggested UKIP leader Nigel Farage should be the UK's next ambassador in Washington. But how are leading diplomats chosen?Washington - along with postings to the UN, Paris and the EU - is among the most coveted jobs in the Diplomatic Service.To the constant refrain - particularly from politicians in London - that the ""special relationship"" is in rude health, life as UK ambassador in Washington is a round of parties, functions, high-level meetings and trips to the White House. Not to mention getting paid £184,999 a year.It would seem the ideal job for a big figure, one not shy of courting public attention. And Nigel Farage - interim leader of UKIP, friend of President-elect Donald Trump - would certainly fit that description.Mr Trump has tweeted his backing: ""Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!""The UK government is, to use diplomatic language, not entirely in accord. It has ruled out the idea, stating that current ambassador Sir Kim Darroch is ""very good"" and will be in Washington ""for some years"".Perhaps the most surprising element of Mr Trump's suggestion, for those reading about it in the UK, is that Mr Farage -  a politician not a diplomat - could be considered for the job.Sir Christopher Meyer, the UK's ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, says: ""The systems are very different. In the US many of the ambassadors are donors and people who have helped the president's election campaign. This is normal in the American system, but not in the UK.""The American Foreign Service Association says that, of the ambassadorial appointments during Barack Obama's presidency, 69.7% have been career diplomats and the remaining 30.3% have been political figures. Most of what are known as the ""plum"" jobs tend to go to the latter group.The current US ambassador in London, Matthew Barzun, was an internet entrepreneur who acted as national finance chairman for Mr Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.""I'm not absolutely opposed to the idea of political appointees in the UK too,"" says Sir Christopher. ""Often they are clever people with fresh ideas. As long as they have got good staff who understand the system, it can work very well.""There is no UK rule against political appointees as ambassadors. David Ormsby-Gore, a former Conservative minister, did the Washington job from 1961 to 1965. Labour supporter and former New Statesman editor John Freeman did the same from 1969 to 1971.In 1977, concerns of nepotism were raised when TV presenter and Times economics columnist Peter Jay became the UK's ambassador in Washington. He was the son-in-law of the then Prime Minister, James Callaghan.""That was particularly controversial at the time,"" said Richard Whitman, senior visiting fellow at the foreign affairs think tank Chatham House.In the UK, potential ambassadors, the vast majority of them career diplomats, are recommended by the Foreign Office and have to be approved by Buckingham Palace, as they have a dual role of representing the government and the Crown.It's a ""fairly straightforward"" process, says Prof Whitman. ""You can see someone who looks like they're going to be an ambassador as they come through the Diplomatic Service. The type of training they are given, usually across the civil service and in Number 10, getting a really wide experience, marks them out.""What you want, particularly for the Washington job, is people who are not just very good technical diplomats but very attuned politically.""This means sending back snippets of information you ""wouldn't see in the newspapers"", gained from formal meetings and informal chats, Prof Whitman adds. Ambassadors require high-level security vetting too.Although political appointees are more common in the US, the Senate has to confirm those selected. This can result in rejections and delays.Prof Whitman suggests the UK system, obviously less public, is also less confrontational. ""The government wouldn't propose someone who wasn't acceptable or appointable to the Palace,"" he says. ""I would describe ambassadors' development as a career-long vetting.""The Civil Service Commission says all appointments must be ""made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition"" to be ""lawful"".It adds: ""Merit means the appointment of the best available person judged against the essential criteria for the role. No-one should be appointed to a job unless they are competent to do it and the job must be offered to the person who would do it best.""The US has a tradition of appointing celebrities to ambassadorships. In fact, Mr Trump's first wife, Ivana Trump, has suggested her ex-husband should pick her to oversee diplomatic ties with the Czech Republic, where she was born and raised. ""They could not send a better US ambassador to Prague,"" Czech President Milos Zeman reportedly told her in a statement.The former child star Shirley Temple - dubbed ""Little Miss Miracle"" by President Franklin D Roosevelt for raising morale during the Great Depression - served in Ghana from 1974 to 1976.But Sir Christopher, who received languages training during his long civil service apprenticeship and has suggested a good diplomat needs ""a quick mind, a hard head, a strong stomach, a warm smile and a cold eye"", thinks his more focused training did him good.Despite the closeness of UK-US ties, ""you often have to play hardball,"" he says. ""A political appointee can work but what can't happen is allowing a foreign government to dictate who should be your ambassador. That's unacceptable."""
2016-11-22,Brexit clues?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38050098,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAmid the howling winds of a storm that came across the English channel at the weekend, a few hatches were being fastened down at the Treasury.The Chancellor Philip Hammond gave a round of interviews on Sunday morning adopting a cautious tone on the economic outlook.He spoke of slowing business investment, higher inflation, and ""eye-watering"" levels of government debt. It came ahead of his first major economic announcement - Wednesday's Autumn Statement.Mr Hammond reflected on some apparent ill-winds from the continent by saying that Brexit negotiations will bring ""an unprecedented level of uncertainty"".Commentators were predicting a slowing of economic growth, he said. All this provided the economic context - as he saw it - to the next in a series of crucial political events before the government pushes the EU exit button by April next year. The Autumn Statement will give us the first clues as to how ministers intend to steer the economy and the public finances into the start of the EU negotiation period.And it will come alongside an economic outlook from the government's tax and spending watchdog - the Office for Budget Responsibility - which will cover the period beyond Britain's planned exit from the EU. Besides the financial assessments, Mr Hammond has a political path to navigate strewn with trip hazards.First, he must decide how far he needs to mitigate any ""uncertainty"" ahead. During the summer the Treasury made it clear it was abandoning the tough spending rules imposed by George Osborne - which said that the government's books must be balanced by 2020. The Brexit vote had changed the circumstances, said Mr Hammond, so new fiscal rules were required to deal with the ""turbulence"" that might arrive. Some commentators speculated that a government spending splurge may be in the offing.But appearing to show too much ""stimulus"" may anger cabinet colleagues who argued hardest for Brexit - and who believe too much emphasis on risk and uncertainty can be self-fulfilling. Mr Hammond watched the events of the summer - when Brexiteers criticised the Bank of England for reacting too soon by cutting interest rates to record lows, when in their view the economic circumstances did not merit it. The mood music from the chancellor is certainly not at that pitch.He has spoken instead of the need for credibility in managing the public finances - code for keeping spending down. He dropped a hint that he is likely to stick to George Osborne's savings to Universal Credit and other welfare spending - a move that has been much criticised by Labour. But a retreat too far towards the tough fiscal rules adopted by his predecessor would leave him open to criticism from opposition parties.They would say the government had abandoned those it pledged to help who are 'just managing' to get by. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the fall in the value of the pound is likely to push up prices by around 2.5%, with food, fuel and clothing among the items worst affected. The chancellor knows the line he has to tread: Not overplaying the uncertainty yet showing support for voters likely to feel the squeeze; being seen to support investment and job creation but staying credible in managing the public finances. Meanwhile, the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday is likely to be pored over for any hints as to direction of travel on Brexit. The watchdog bases its five year outlook on stated government policy - but there has been very little detail of that around when it comes to the UK's potential negotiating stance. The signs so far are that the Treasury is attempting to shift the focus with press releases on funding tech and infrastructure, being a ""global leader"" for free trade and investment - making Britain ""match fit"" for life after Brexit. Labour is trying to carve out its point of difference by accusing Mr Hammond of being ""weak"" in refusing to abandon austerity completely. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell calls all this ""gimmicks and giveaways"" and says the Treasury should be spending significantly more on infrastructure and job creation. The party says it would put £500bn into such projects over 10 years, funded through borrowing, while balancing the books on ""day to day"" spending and taxation. The government calls this ""fantasy economics"". So expect a relatively low-key Autumn Statement - but one in whose finer details we may be able to glean more about the government's stance on Brexit, whatever the weather. "
2016-11-22,Business beat,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38057462,"There were no hecklers this year, more a respectful silence as the gathered audience listened to the big name.  And despite her talent for saying very little, and indeed, the prime minister's determination to give hardly anything away on her plans for Brexit, this morning at the CBI she did in the end say rather a lot. No surprises, when it comes to the big picture, the prime minister was abundantly clear (again) that she won't be pushed into giving more details of her plans for how we leave the EU and life afterward. That was despite the fact that she took to the stage moments after the CBI President who could not have been any clearer in making the organisation's demand for more information. It is five months since the referendum this week, but despite the growing pressure from business and in Westminster, she is not budging. The CBI, a lobby as powerful as they get, basically said, ""please, please, tell us what is going on"". Theresa May in response minutes later essentially said, ""not a chance"". But she did give some things away. While Downing Street denies it's a U-turn, the prime minister scotched any suggestion (including her own) that the government might make companies have workers sitting on their boards. One of the first proposals she made when she launched her bid to lead the country  was ""If I'm prime minister, we're going to change that system - and we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.""You wouldn't have been a fool for concluding that she meant that big firms would therefore have to have staff members on their boards. Not now, according to Downing Street. She said this morning that she never meant that firms would have to appoint workers directly to boards, although some companies may wish to do that.But there is no coincidence that the policy has undergone what you might politely call an evolution, after business was alarmed. Unions this afternoon have poked fun at what they see as a U-turn, the TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying ""If Mrs May says Brexit means Brexit, surely workers on boards means workers on boards"".The government is consulting on its plans. I understand the likely option is company boards to have one director whose sole responsibility is representing workers' views - we'll know in due course. The prime minister did recommit the government to the target of making British corporation tax - the tax on company profits - the lowest in the G20. It is scheduled to come down to 17 per cent in any case by the end of this Parliament. The trouble with her repeating the previous promise is that since it was made Donald Trump has emerged, with his promise to cut federal corporation tax to 15 per cent.It is not a direct comparison. But having said last night that the prime minister had to be taken at face value as she made that commitment, government sources today slapped it down with accusations of ""pure speculation"". But business leaders will have no doubt filed that promise away. Whether May meant it or not, she is on the record as making that promise, a fact not lost on the previous Chancellor, George Osborne, who made the 15 per cent proposal previously and was enjoying its re-emergence today.But what Theresa May did hint at today, and we are in the business of hunting for hints, was the possibility that there will be an interim agreement with the European Union to run after we leave, but before a final deal can be struck.This would risk the wrath of the Brexiteers. But while the specifics of a transitional agreement have not been discussed in Cabinet, one minister explained ""a reality check has started to happen"" and they suggested that a temporary deal ""may have to happen - it's a practical option"". No 10 sources are playing down the significance of today's comments with their familiar refrain - they're not ruling anything in, or anything out. But like the promise on corporation tax, that hint will be filed away by politicians on both sides - those who are looking to keep our ties to the EU as tight as possible, and those arguing for a fast, clean exit.  The relationship that Theresa May will have with the business community is one of the most important that she will have, particularly at a time of enormous political and economic uncertainty.Although business has welcomed her support and promises of extra government spending on research and development and infrastructure, they know that she is willing to criticise too - calling again for a minority of businesses who behave badly to get in line. One cabinet minister suggested that just as Tony Blair was willing to take on the unions, a Labour leader seeking to appeal to the centre by taking on his party's traditional supporters, Theresa May is keen to do the same, taking on business, a well of traditional Tory support. But these are early days, and probably not the last time Theresa May will stand on the CBI platform. So far there's a sense that they don't quite know what to make of her. And perhaps, she doesn't know quite what to make of them."

2016-11-22,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161122222156/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-23,UK economy 'resilient' despite £122bn hit,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38068358,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe UK economy is ""resilient"" despite forecasts that government finances will be £122bn worse off than previously expected by 2020, the chancellor said.In his Autumn Statement Philip Hammond said growth predictions had been cut as a result of the Brexit vote.As widely expected, he unveiled a fuel duty freeze and more cash for housing, transport and digital infrastructure.Labour said the government was ""unprepared and ill-equipped"" for Brexit and had ""no vision"".Mr Hammond told MPs the UK's deficit would no longer be cleared by 2020 - with the target instead ""as early as possible"" afterwards.Mr Hammond said the statement - his first major Commons event as chancellor - came exactly five months after a Brexit vote which ""will change the course of Britain's history"", making it ""more urgent than ever"" to tackle long-term economic weaknesses.Presenting the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts, he said borrowing would hit £68.2bn this year and £59bn next year, compared with the March forecast of £55.5bn and £38.8bn.The OBR said the referendum result meant potential growth in the current Parliament would be 2.4 percentage points lower than forecast in March. Government finances are forecast to be £122bn worse off than in the spring.Among the chancellor's announcements were:Mr Hammond said the government would prioritise ""additional high-value investment"" on infrastructure, which would be funded by additional borrowing.He paid tribute to his predecessor George Osborne but said he would now follow three new fiscal rules: to balance the books ""as early as possible in the next Parliament"", for public sector net debt to be falling as a share of GDP by the end of Parliament and for welfare spending to be within a cap.The OBR based its forecasts on the assumption that the UK would leave the EU in April 2019 - two years after the government's deadline for triggering negotiations with Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.It also assumed new trading arrangements would slow import and export growth for a decade and that migration would be restricted.It said the increased borrowing would result from weak tax receipts and lower than expected growth predictions as a result of June's vote to leave the European Union.Based on its assumptions around Brexit - the government has not yet revealed the details of its negotiating plan - it predicted the referendum result would account for an extra £58bn of borrowing.This included a predicted £16bn increase as a result of lower migration and £18.1bn because of lower productivity growth.The OBR said its forecasts for Brexit were ""uncertain"", and they were disputed by Conservative MP John Redwood, who said: ""Their forecast probably is too low, their borrowing forecast is far too high, and we'll get good access to the single market once we're out of the EU.""The Economists for Brexit group said the OBR had ""assumed a pessimistic outlook for the UK economy outside the EU, based on bad economic policy-making"".At the end of his speech, Mr Hammond revealed the Autumn Statement would be scrapped in future years, saying there was no need for major tax changes to be made twice a year.Instead, he added to laughter from MPs, there would be a ""Spring Statement"" where the government would respond to OBR forecasts, and the Budget would take place in the Autumn. It is not clear whether that means there will be two Budgets in 2017.Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorOuch!There was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than £100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly £60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going.Remember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession.But what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications.Read more from LauraThe government had already announced an extra £2bn a year for science by 2020, a crackdown on compensation claims for whiplash injuries aimed at reducing motorists' insurance premiums and £1.3bn to improve roads.Changes to Universal Credit - the flagship single payment being rolled out across the UK - will reduce the ""taper rate"" from 65% to 63%. This means benefits will be withdrawn at a rate of 63p for every pound of net earnings.The government said about three million households would benefit.But the Resolution Foundation think-tank said their gains would be ""small fry"" compared with previously announced cuts to the work allowance, which is the amount people can earn before they start to lose their benefits.On housing, the government said it would relax rules on how affordable housing funding could be used.It said banning letting agents' upfront fees would help 4.3 million private rental tenants.Citizens Advice welcomed measures on the agents' fees and on workers' wages but said more should be done to help ""just-managing families"".Labour, which has been calling for agents' fees to be banned, said: ""Any change of heart is welcome"" but added that the government had ""no plan"" to fix the housing crisis.Responding to Mr Hammond in the Commons, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Autumn Statement placed on record the ""abject failure of the last six years"".He condemned the government's approach to austerity and said the people the prime minister promised to protect - those who are ""just about managing"" - had been ""betrayed"".""After all the sacrifices people have made over the past six years, I fear today's statement has laid the foundations for more wasted years,"" he added.The SNP said Mr Hammond had offered little on the ""elephant in the room"" - Brexit - while the Lib Dems said the government would ""hit people in the pocket through their hapless handling of Brexit"".But UKIP said billions were being wasted by the government ""delaying"" the UK's exit from the EU.Plaid Cymru said there was little in the statement to help rebuild the Welsh economy and close the wage gap with England.If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question.

2016-11-23,Man jailed for 'terrorist' murder of Jo Cox,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38079594,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThomas Mair has been jailed for life after being found guilty of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.The 53-year-old shot and stabbed to death the mother-of-two in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June, a week before the EU referendum vote.Mair shouted ""Britain first"" in the attack, but the judge said the true ""patriot"" was Mrs Cox, not Mair.Prosecutors said Mair was motivated by hate and his crimes were ""nothing less than acts of terrorism"".Mrs Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, had been on her way to a constituency surgery when she was set upon outside Birstall library in front of two of her assistants and shocked constituents.Mair shot the 41-year-old with a sawn-off rifle and stabbed her with a dagger, turning on 78-year-old Bernard Kenny, who tried to stop him. In a raid of his home nearby, police found Nazi-related material.Thomas Mair: The man who murdered MP Jo CoxBrendan Cox: 'Jo strengthened, not silenced'Conviction closes 'sad chapter' for BirstallWestminster reacts to verdicts What the judge told Thomas MairRolling coverage and reaction to verdictsThe jury found Mair guilty on three other counts: having a firearm with intent, causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Mr Kenny and having an offensive weapon, namely a dagger.Mair, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, remained impassive as the verdicts were read out, after just over 90 minutes of deliberations.He had not entered a plea and chose not to give evidence in his defence at the trial.But before sentencing, Mair asked to speak to the courtroom. The judge declined, saying he had already had an opportunity.Daniela Relph, BBC News correspondentThe jury took just one hour and 36 minutes to reach its verdicts. Every seat in courtroom eight of the Old Bailey was filled as the jury foreman stood to deliver the guilty verdicts.From Mair there was no reaction. He had maintained his silence throughout the trial and during every police interview.As the verdicts were delivered, Jo Cox's family smiled. Her sister, Kim, held her mother's hand. Then Jo Cox's husband read a victim impact statement.Standing in the witness box, in front of the man who murdered his wife, Brendan Cox told Mair that he pitied him because his life was devoid of love and consumed by hatred. It was a highly charged moment.The Cox family watched as Mair was led away, in silence, to begin his life sentence.In a statement read to a packed courtroom at the Old Bailey, Mrs Cox's husband Brendan said he was not there for ""retribution"" and felt ""nothing but pity"" for Mair.Later, speaking outside court, he said his wife's killing was an incompetent and self-defeating act of terrorism that was driven by hatred but instead created an outpouring of love.His family would not respond to hatred with hatred, he said, and Jo's ideas and values would live on in her children, and family.In sentencing, Judge Mr Justice Wilkie described Mrs Cox as ""a wonderful mother, daughter, sister, partner, and companion"".He said her generosity of spirit was ""evident in the selfless concern she had for others, even when facing a violent death"", referring to Mrs Cox's plea to her assistants to get away and save themselves, as she lay dying in the street. Addressing Mair, he said: ""You affect to be a patriot. The words you uttered repeatedly when you killed her, give lip service to that concept. ""Those sentiments can be legitimate and can have resonance but in your mouth, allied to your actions, they are tainted and made toxic.""Mair's inspiration was not love of country but admiration for Nazism, the judge said.He said Mair had not the courage to acknowledge what he had done and forced Mrs Cox's family to relive the events.By contrast, your second victim of the day - Mr Kenny - acted ""instinctively and courageously"" to try to save Mrs Cox and deserves the highest praise, he said to Mair.Mr Justice Wilkie said the murder was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism, associated with Nazism.He said the aggravating feature was the weeks of planning in which Mair researched Mrs Cox, a past assassination of a serving MP and matricide, knowing she was the mother of young children.The judge sentenced Mair to life imprisonment, with a whole life term.He said he had concluded that the offence was so exceptional that Mair could only be released by a secretary of state.Outside court, Mrs Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater said she and her parents, Jean and Gordon, were relieved that the process was over after a difficult few months.""We can and we will work through our pain and, as a family, we are stronger and more united than ever.""I, for one, will not be beaten by what has happened and I know I am not alone - it is the last thing my sister would want,"" she said.""There may have been one act of extreme cowardice on that day, but there were acts of extreme bravery,"" she added.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mair had ""robbed the world of an ambassador of kindness"" and urged her fellow MPs to confront those who wish to promote the hatred and division that led to her murder.Home Secretary Amber Rudd called it a ""shocking and senseless murder"" that was ""an attack on all of us and the values we share of democracy and tolerance"".""As home secretary, I am determined that we challenge extremism in all its forms including the evil of far right extremism and the terrible damage it can cause to individuals, families and communities,"" she said.The Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: ""Mair has offered no explanation for his actions but the prosecution was able to demonstrate that, motivated by hate, his pre-meditated crimes were nothing less than acts of terrorism designed to advance his twisted ideology.""The CPS said it worked closely with police to build a strong case, and commended a number of ""brave"" eye witnesses who gave evidence.Mair was a ""cold-blooded killer"" who lived a solitary lifestyle, with no social circle and had never come to the notice of the police before, DS Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, said.Nothing could ever excuse the evil and the horror that he brought to the small town of Birstall, he added."

""You must now do the right thing for British workers and businesses - you must insist on full, tariff-free access to the single market....""If you stand up for British business and jobs in fighting for single market access, you will have our support.""Turning to the rest of the statement, Mr McDonnell claimed six million people were earning less than the living wage and accused the Conservatives of treating so-called Jams - those who are ""just about managing"" - as being an ""electoral demographic"", adding ""to us they are our friends and the people we represent"".""If you really want to make a fair tax system as well, you can start by bringing back the 50p rate for the very richest in our country.""'Race to the bottom'He said it was regrettable that the chancellor was still going ahead with some of the cuts to Universal Credits, accusing him of ""betraying"" working single parents who he claims are at least £2,300 worse off.He called for additional support for the social care budget, stressing: ""We now have 3.9 million people on NHS waiting lists ... Many of those are waiting in pain and they have got no relief today.""He described the scrapping of tenant and letting fees as ""a victory for Labour campaigning"", but said home ownership was still ""a dream"" for the under 25s because fewer houses had been built under the Conservatives since the 1920s.He said the chancellor was ""continuing a race to the bottom"" on corporation tax, while continuing to cut public services and cut taxes for big businesses.But in response, Mr Hammond said the top 1% of earners contribute 27% of the tax paid. ""Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to finance all your ambitions."""
2016-11-23,Kuenssberg: Hammond paints bruising backdrop,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38082943,"Ouch!There was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than £100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly £60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going. Remember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession. But what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications. First off, with the goal of balancing the books now an aspiration to be met as ""early as possible"", next Parliament, the Tories will be going into the next election, a decade after they took charge, without having kept the central promise they made 10 years before of clearing the deficit. Yes, you read that right - a full decade. As political promises go, that is a less than glorious record. Voters will see the national debt hitting 90% of GDP, not shy of £2 trillion, 10 years after being told that tough spending cuts were worth it, because within five years we would be on our way back to the mythic sunlit uplands.  There is a separate debate about whether that was ever achievable, and how much Brexit can be blamed for the fact Mr Hammond has pushed those targets back again.  But at the very least, it means the Conservatives will still be borrowing, and borrowing significantly, busting their own timetable by at least five years. And with wages predicted to slow, and inflation expected to rise, the public will feel the pinch too. Simply, if today's forecasts are right, the government's finances are set to be shaky for a lot longer, and more voters will feel skint. Despite Theresa May's repeated desire to help families who are finding it hard to make ends meet, there were few measures that will make a big difference. Privately, Treasury sources acknowledge they haven't done that much, despite Number 10's hopes. The truth is that they didn't have much cash to play with. And Mr Hammond's ambitions to rebuild the fundamentals of the economy were clearly his priority, rather than major concessions to help some groups of voters feel a bit more flush. Indeed, the charts that estimate who is bearing the brunt of the government's policies suggest that when everything is taken into consideration, not just today's measures, the three poorest groups are all slightly worse off. The only group that loses more is the top 10%. Beyond all the charts and tables and documents, though, Mr Hammond dropped one giant hint which is perhaps politically one of the most important things of the day. He was talking about the ""triple lock"", the guaranteed increases in the state pension, seen by many in Westminster privately to be completely unaffordable in the longer term, but few will yet say it in public. He said: ""And we will meet our pledge to our country's pensioners through the triple lock. But as we look ahead to the next Parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability.""And so the government will review public spending priorities and other commitments for the next Parliament in light of the evolving fiscal position at the next Spending Review.""That sounds pretty bland, but the implications are anything but. It holds out the possibility that the Tories could look at ditching those guarantees and ""other commitments"", perhaps the ring fence of the NHS Budget, when they look at what the country can afford after 2020.It was only a hint, but in time it may become a very important one. Mr Hammond rarely says anything by mistake.But, without fighting that political battle, there was plenty that was bruising enough from today's announcements, plenty to make the government's life harder, and indeed, potentially those of plenty of voters too. PS As ever, the documents published alongside the statement bear close examination. In the coming days more important nuggets may emerge. But a few quick ones that caught our eye -  the administration of Brexit is expected to cost the taxpayer £412m. The government has set aside £60m a year for grammar schools to expand."

""Instead we have seen further cuts to earnings for those in work through cuts to Universal Credit and a living wage increase that is lower than expected under the previous chancellor. This is a new Conservative leadership with no answers to the challenges facing our country following Brexit, and no vision to secure our future prosperity.""SNP economic spokesman Stewart Hosie:""The chancellor did give us plenty of information today but with no more than a kind of glib reference to being 'match-fit' at the beginning and a bit of deflection, very little actually on the elephant in the room which is Brexit. It's not as if the Treasury don't know what the consequences will be.""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron:""We've seen the gap between what we could've had and what we will have is a quarter of a trillion pounds over this Parliament. Can you imagine the number of nurses, doctors, social workers, teachers, police officers and soldiers we could be paying for if this government hadn't headed for a hard Brexit that nobody voted for?""Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg:Claiming the OBR forecasts are probably wrong, the Leave campaigner said: ""They assume that we will apply tariffs on the same basis inside the European Union, which the chancellor will know he will be able to remove. And secondly, they're particularly gloomy on the prospects for financial services. I wonder, therefore, if we might be able to take a little bit more of an optimistic tone, and indeed with the freedoms we have outside the customs unions and the single market, the ability to solve the productivity problem.""Conservative former minister John Redwood:""The OBR are probably still quite wrong about 2017 - their forecast probably is too low, their borrowing forecast is far too high, and we'll get good access to the single market once we're out of the EU.""Conservative former Chancellor George Osborne: ""The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has given us a very sobering assessment of the economic and borrowing challenges that Britain faces and the chancellor is right to keep his powder dry.""Conservative former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke:""Would you finally confirm that wherever you hold your cards that you will continue, inside the government if necessary, to spell out the economic reality of the long-term benefits to this country if you want to develop a modern competitive economy, of retaining the access to our most important market in Europe, by retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union, and that no amount of short-term political pressure should allow you to be deflected from that?""Labour former leader Ed Miliband:Referring to the OBR's forecast that £58bn of the worsening in public finances ""is due to the Brexit decision"", he said: ""Isn't this a salutary warning to us about the decisions we take in the coming months and years? And isn't it a very strong argument for us  remaining as close as possible to our largest trading area, the single market, and inside not outside the customs union?""Conservative former minister Anna Soubry:""Yes, there's some bad news there - this is the reality of Brexit - so we need now to make sure we do everything we can to mitigate the damage that it undoubtedly will cause.""London Mayor Sadiq Khan:""I'm delighted that we today took the first steps towards a major new devolution deal for London. London has a bigger population than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined, but we have far less control over how our city is run. Today marks the first step in our journey to give the capital a greater voice so we can protect jobs, wealth and prosperity and provide an extra incentive for economic growth.""Green Party co-leader and MP Caroline Lucas:Criticising the chancellor for failing to mention climate change, she said: ""With Trump's election this could have been a moment for Britain to become a world-leader in the fight against catastrophic climate change but, instead, we see little evidence of a commitment to facing up to the greatest challenge of our times. Indeed, it is shameful that the chancellor failed to even mention climate change in his speech.""Unite general secretary Len McCluskey:""What is clear is that the Conservative party owes the UK people a huge apology.  With debt set to soar, yet more promised targets missed and living standards still dropping, the truth is that Tory policies were a massive fraud.  Six years of pain for the poorest, six years of sustained assault on our public services - and with more to come - have taken our economy and country backwards.""Unison general secretary Dave Prentis:""Hopes were raised the chancellor would conjure up extra cash for social care, and ease the burden on the NHS and local councils struggling to keep a lid on the growing crisis. Instead the government has chosen to ignore social care, preferring to look the other way as a growing number of elderly people are getting no care at all.""Adam Marshall, British Chambers of Commerce director general:""Philip Hammond has delivered a responsible, solid and focused package that will reassure both business and markets.""CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn:""The government is right to accept the independent Low Pay Commission recommendations, as firms want to see affordable rises in the minimum wage that protects the low-paid and avoids damaging job prospects. The chancellor should keep a watching brief on the challenges created by higher inflation and uncertainty weighing on near-term business investment.""Mike Cherry, Federation of Small Businesses' chairman:""Our members are pleased with the confirmation of plans to remove £6.7bn from the business rates system, and the decision to make rural rate relief fairer for small firms, but there will need to be stronger fiscal interventions to boost the economy next year, with the prospect of weaker longer-term growth looming.""Simon Walker, Institute of Directors director general:""The chancellor's attempts to increase productivity by investing in transport infrastructure, broadband and housing are welcome, but businesses would also have liked to have seen measures to encourage them to invest now. The OBR predicts that next year will be the low point for growth, so we are surprised that amidst all of the political and economic uncertainty there weren't many measures to help 'just managing' businesses now.""Mark Serwotka, Public and Commercial Services union general secretary:""It is pure hypocrisy for the chancellor to talk about wanting to help struggling families but continue to hold down the wages of the government's own workforce who have suffered years and years of pay cuts. We will be talking to other unions in the coming weeks about taking action together to bring the pay freeze to an end, so we can put money back in people's pockets and help revive our flagging economy.""Gareth Stace, UK Steel director:""Today's lack of any tangible announcements either on energy or business rates represent a blow for the steel sector. The crisis UK steel producers have faced in the last year highlighted the impact uncompetitive energy prices were having and we were looking to the Autumn Statement for a decisive response.""Michelle Mitchell, MS Society chief executive:""We're deeply disappointed the Autumn Statement has failed to address the crisis facing social care. At a time when social care is in dire need, its absence from the chancellor's statement spells tough years ahead for the thousands of people, including the vast majority of people with MS, who need care and support.""Martin Tett, LGA transport spokesman:Responding to the announcement of £1.1bn to be spent on improving Britain's local roads and public transport, he said: ""The backlog of repairs on existing roads currently stands at £12bn and it would currently take 14 years to fix the backlog of potholes.... This gulf in funding puts the country's businesses at a competitive disadvantage and provides poor value for money.""Lord Porter, Local Government Association chairman:""Councils, the NHS, charities and care providers have been clear about the desperate need for the chancellor to take action to tackle the funding crisis in social care. It is unacceptable that this has not been addressed.""Sarah McMonagle, Federation of Master Builders' director of external affairs: ""The chancellor's commitment to double annual capital spending on housing by 2020 demonstrates that he understands that house building and economic growth are intrinsically linked. For every £1 invested in construction, £2.84 is generated in the wider economy and therefore the best way to protect ourselves from an economic wobble as we leave the EU is to invest in our built environment.""Neil Broadhead, PwC's head of UK infrastructure:""The chancellor's commitment to allocate £1bn to small 'shovel-ready' schemes like local road improvements is a much-needed and welcome move... However, this represents only one stage on the UK's long journey to achieve an infrastructure base fit for the 21st century.""Matthew Reed, The Children's Society's chief executive:""There's been plenty of talk of helping the just-about-managing families -  the Jams - but sadly the chancellor's cake is half-baked. Unlike last year's Budget, he [the chancellor] hasn't introduced major new cuts for low-income families, but that won't offer much comfort to millions for whom today's announcements will have a very soggy bottom.""Bronwen Maddox, Institute for Government director:""The government still has a huge number of commitments to deliver on top of Brexit. Despite emergency funding for prisons, today we saw little indication of how the chancellor will address the ticking time-bomb in other public services, like health and social care.""Charlotte Holloway, techuk policy director:""A Match-fit Britain must be a Tech-fit Britain, and today the Chancellor gives UK tech a series of welcome announcements... However, there was a real gap when it came to additional support for boosting the UK's digital skills. Similarly, there was a missed opportunity to ensure that the benefits of digital are at the heart of the government's devolution ambitions. We will be looking to the government to reconsider these areas in the next Budget.""Quentin Willson, TV motoring journalist and FairFuelUK lead campaigner:""I'm disappointed the chancellor didn't instantly put money into everyone's pockets by cutting duty. There's an immediate benefit to the economy. I'm surprised too given the Centre for Economics and Business Research has said cutting duty by 3p wouldn't change net tax receipts. This is a lost opportunity from a government still afraid of supporting drivers and roads.""Matt Sutherland, chief operating officer of business mobility specialists Alphabet:On the chancellor's decision over cars gained through salary sacrifice, he said: ""The government should consider the impact this will have on a large number of hard-working employees across the country. Salary sacrifice, in relation to company cars, is not just the preserve of upper-middle class workers; it's an important part of the employment package that many 'Jam' workers enjoy, both in the private or public sector.""If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question.

2016-11-23,Big increase in borrowing predicted,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38078881,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThere will be substantial increases in government borrowing in each of the next five years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).Chancellor Philip Hammond confirmed he would abandon the government target to spend less than it earned by 2019-20.The OBR predicts it will now borrow £21.9bn that year, compared with the £10bn surplus previously forecast.Overall, the government will borrow an extra £122bn by 2020-21, half of which the OBR attributes to the Brexit vote.There has also been a big change in its prediction for the total amount of government debt amassed by 2020-21.The new total is £1.95 trillion, an increase of £210bn from the £1.74 trillion the OBR predicted in March.Those figures include the amount of money the Bank of England is borrowing to support the economy via its asset purchase facility (APF).That money counts as part of national debt, but not as part of the net borrowing figure.There have also been cuts to the expected growth rate in 2017 and 2018. The OBR expects the economy to grow by 1.4% in 2017, down from the 2.2% it predicted in March, while the forecast for growth in 2018 has been cut to 1.7% from 2.1%.The growth forecast for this year has been raised slightly to 2.1% from 2.0%.But Mr Hammond stressed in his Autumn Statement speech that the forecast for 2017 was still equal to the International Monetary Fund's prediction for the German economy and ahead of its forecast for ""many of our European neighbours including France and Italy - a fact that will no doubt be a source of very considerable irritation to some"".Instead of trying to balance the budget in 2019-20, the government will instead aim to do so as soon as possible in the next Parliament as part of its new targets.The OBR warned that there was greater uncertainty than usual surrounding these forecasts, especially for the last two years of the period, because it does not know the terms on which the UK will leave the European Union.""Our economy forecast is not based on a precise prediction of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, but rather on broad-brush judgements consistent with a range of possible outcomes,"" the OBR document said.""We have been given no information about the government's goals and expectations for the negotiations that is not already in the public domain. And we would not in any event wish to base our forecast on assumptions we could not be transparent about.""What the Autumn Statement means for youUK economy 'resilient' despite £122bn hitAutumn Statement latest updatesKey points at-a-glanceYour questions answeredThe lower growth next year is blamed on lower investment and weaker consumer demand ""driven respectively by greater uncertainty and by higher inflation resulting from sterling depreciation"".  Slowing economic growth is expected to increase unemployment - rising from the current rate of 4.8% to reach 5.5% by the end of 2018.""This relatively modest increase in the rate equates to around 200,000 more people unemployed,"" the OBR said.Much of the slowdown in the economy predicted by the OBR is due to rising inflation as a result of the weakness of the pound. CPI inflation next year is expected to be 2.3%, up from the previous forecast of 1.6%, while the prediction for 2018 has risen to 2.5% from 2%. The OBR said that its forecasts were ""somewhat less pessimistic"" than the Bank of England's predictions from earlier this month and also the Treasury's analysis from before the EU referendum.The Treasury had predicted that the economy would contract in the first quarter after a vote to leave the EU, although that was based on the assumption that Article 50 would be triggered immediately, starting the process of leaving.The OBR unexpectedly included a chapter in its analysis comparing its forecasts with what would have happened to the economy if the vote had gone the other way.It concludes that the vote to leave the EU will cut growth by reducing migration, slowing the growth of productivity and increasing inflation.  Debt as a proportion of economic output is expected to continue rising until 2017-18, when it peaks at 90.2%.The forecast was based on a judgement that import and export growth would slow for the next 10 years.At a news conference, OBR chief Robert Chote said that the government had provided all the information needed to make the forecast, but that when the Treasury had been asked if any assurances had been given to Nissan that could pose a risk to the forecast, it declined to say.Last month, Nissan announced that it would build two new models in Sunderland following government ""support and assurances"".But the government has now said that it has not taken on any new liabilities to persuade the carmaker to stay in the North East of England."

This will not be the first time the UK has seen a Budget held in the autumn. There has been back-and-forth movement as governments have changed.The practice during the Callaghan and Thatcher governments was for a Budget in the spring. It focused on taxation and was accompanied by an Autumn Statement setting out the government's spending plans for the next year.In 1993, the then chancellor Kenneth Clarke merged tax and spending announcements into an autumn Budget. There was also a short summer economic forecast, when figures would be updated.When Gordon Brown was chancellor, he reverted to a Budget in March and added a Pre-Budget Report (PBR), which was intended to be a short document reporting on progress since the Budget.Without introducing any tax measures, the PBR was meant to assist the discussion of tax proposals, but it became for all intents and purposes a second annual Budget. George Osborne changed the name of the PBR to the Autumn Statement, but the format was the same and it contained many tax measures, sometimes more than were included in the March Budget.However, not everyone was happy with Mr Hammond's announcement to revert to an autumn Budget.""The Autumn Statement has long been a Budget in all but name, and two Budgets a year are too many.  But the chancellor simply seems to be swapping the statements around,"" said Alex Henderson, tax partner at PwC.""There's a good reason Budgets happen in March as that's when the government's fiscal year ends and there's adequate data to work with. March budgets date back to medieval times, for good reason,"" he added."

The more expensive agreements for cars, accommodation and school fees will be protected for longer - until April 2021.What the Autumn Statement means for youMinisters back Autumn Statement forecastsUK economy 'resilient' despite £122bn hitAutumn Statement latest updatesKey points at-a-glanceYour questions answeredThe business lobby group, the CBI, warned that the ""measure sends the wrong signal to companies wanting to invest more in employee health and wellbeing"".And the Reward and Employee Benefits Association (Reba), which represents HR workers for some of the UK's largest firms, said the move would affect lower paid earners the most.""It will be the 'just about managing' employees which will be most affected by no longer having access to so many health and wellbeing benefits and mobile phones,"" said Debi O'Donovan, director at Reba.""While the Reward & Employee Benefits Association agrees that the government did need to clamp down on the increasing misuse of salary sacrifice for more 'luxury' perks, we are disappointed that so many essential employee benefits have been caught up in this change.""However, the Treasury estimates that of the £200m per year that it expects to save, more than half will come from higher rate earners. It reckons that about one million employees benefit from such schemes and that they have increased by 30% since 2009-10.In its consultation document, it gives the example of a 24-month mobile phone contract worth £1,000. That would cost the Exchequer £321 for a basic rate taxpayer, or £426 if the employee is in the highest rate tax bracket."

And he pledged £390m for work on low emission vehicles and the development of connected autonomous vehicles.Fuel duty remains the biggest component of the price of diesel and petrol. Motorists also pay 20% value added tax on those fuels.It was last increased in January 2011 from 58.19p to 58.95p a litre and cut by a penny in the Budget two months later.Mr Hammond said: ""This will save the average car driver £130 a year and the average van driver £350 a year.""It is a tax cut worth £850m next year and means the current freeze is the longest for 40 years.""What the Autumn Statement means for youUK economy 'resilient' despite £122bn hitAutumn Statement latest updatesKey points at-a-glanceYour questions answeredDrivers could also find their journey times cut after the chancellor announced investment of £220m to ""address traffic pinch points on strategic roads"".He also promised £110m for an Oxford to Cambridge Expressway as well as East West Rail to create ""a transformational tech-corridor"" to link ""the world-class research strengths of our two best-known universities"". In addition, the government will invest £450m to trial digital signalling on the railways to ""achieve a step change in reliability and to squeeze more capacity out of our existing rail infrastructure"".Mr Hammond added: ""Reliable transport networks are essential to growth and productivity so this Autumn Statement commits significant additional funding to keep Britain moving now and to invest in the transport networks and vehicles of the future.""

2016-11-23,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It will incorporate EU legislation into UK law, after which the government will decide which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-23,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-23,Steady hand...,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38080460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkAt a time of great uncertainty the new chancellor chose to display caution.Despite long wanting to get his hands on the nation's purse strings, Philip Hammond was not tempted into grand gestures.There were modest giveaways for those ""just about managing"" in order to keep true to Theresa May's promise of a Government for all; a reduction in the rate benefits are withdrawn for those working, a ban on letting fees and a boost to the minimum wage - much briefed in advance to perhaps gain some headlines before gloomy forecasts became the story.There was a shift away from his predecessor's focus on deficit reduction within a set timeframe - instead Mr Hammond said he would deliver a surplus as soon as possible, announcing investment in housing and roads, money for research and development - the focus on boosting productivity.But this was still a Chancellor keen to limit spending in order to secure stability.Brexit has made the future unpredictable.Philip Hammond may have more insight that most into the Government's planned approach to leaving the EU, but he still wanted to ensure he had enough in his back pocket to withstand any shocks that may come.And with vast increases in borrowing and reduced growth predicted, Mr Hammond limited the giveaways and changed the economic rules to give himself the flexibility to respond.This was a careful balancing act, an attempt to follow through on promised support for those in society who need it most while keeping the nation's books in order. At the same time, this was an attempt to recognise the potential economic turbulence Brexit could bring without invoking the ire of backbench Eurosceptics with an overly negative outlook. Mr Hammond was careful to speak of opportunities as well as challenges, describing a ""great nation"", resilient and strong.By his own admission there was no grand ""rabbit in the hat"". Mr Hammond wasn't out to steal the show, but rather prove he can be the steady hand on the tiller in choppy economic waters.But for Labour, this was an opportunity to seize on a chink in the government's economic armour, with the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying the much-hailed long term economic plan had been an ""abject failure""."
2016-11-23,What does it mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38077596,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkYou sent us your questions on the Autumn Statement. Below we answer some of the most common:Is this saying we, as a nation, will be £122bn worse off because of Brexit? Not quite. The figure of £122bn is from the Office of Budget Responsibility, which checks all the government's figures. In essence it has calculated that the economy will grow more slowly in the next few years, to the end of the current Parliament.  Tax revenues will not be as strong as previously forecast, but only just half of that, about £59bn, is attributed directly to the aftermath of the Brexit vote. The rest is due to things like changed government policy decisions. But the OBR reckons the government will have to borrow £122bn more than it expected over that time. Are the savings made from austerity cuts being used to shrink the deficit or help pay for tax cuts?A bit of both. The chancellor has a juggling act to perform with the government finances: how to balance spending with income.Spending less (or at least restraining its growth) gives him scope to cut taxes for some people (such as raising the annual allowance) or to reduce the Budget deficit (the gap between his spending and his tax receipts). As you may have noticed, reducing that annual Budget deficit was something of an obsession for the last Chancellor, George Osborne, and it was his primary justification for his austerity policies. Now, Philip Hammond, has deferred that ambition, pushing the target of having a balanced Budget over the horizon into the next Parliament.Who are we actually borrowing from? And who are we in such massive debt to?The national debt (as we used to call it) stands at £1.6 trillionIt has risen rapidly since the great banking crisis of 2007-08 and the subsequent recession. This huge sum consists mainly of money borrowed in the past by the government to cover the gaps between its annual spending (as detailed in each annual Budget) and the money it receives from taxation.The extra cash is typically raised by the government selling bonds, which are glorified IOUs. These are usually bought by professional investors around the world who like the guaranteed interest they receive plus the promise of getting their money back when the bond matures.At the moment, the Bank of England actually owns about a third of all the UK government bonds in issue, as for several years it has been buying them from investors under its policy quantitative easing.When will the letting fees ban come into force?Chancellor Hammond revealed no details of his plan, but his tone suggested an outright ban on up-front fees paid by tenants to letting agents. The government's formal Autumn Statement document says only that the government will now consult on what the new law should look like. So there will be plenty of scope for lobbying and campaigning by interested parties. But there are no details or timetable yet.Are sub-letting fees included - as the owner of a leasehold property which is let out, I am forced to pay over £100 to register new tenants?We do not know yet. The whole idea of abolishing letting agents' fees will now be the subject of consultation. There has been no detail at all from the government.What are the chancellors' plans for resolving the banking crisis? The chancellor did not address these issues in his speech, apart from blaming the last recession on the last Labour government. The Autumn Statement document merely restates the plan to (eventually) sell the government stakes in RBS and Lloyds. If it is of any consolation, £102m of fines on banks will be given over the next four years to armed forces and emergency services charities and ""other related good causes"".Is there anything for first-time buyers?The chancellor did not directly address first-time buyers (FTBs). But in theory the plan to provide another 40,000 ""affordable"" homes in the next five years should benefit FTBs.The money underpinning this should go, in part, to help fund shared-ownership schemes, in which tenants' bills are divided between rent and mortgage payments. And also to fund the ""rent to buy"" scheme, under which tenants pay a reduced rent while they save for a deposit and can put it down as a deposit after five years.Will the state pension go up?The chancellor says that he will keep, for the time being, the ""triple lock"" policy. That guarantees that the state pension goes up by the greater of: the growth in average earnings; the growth of CPI inflation; or 2.5%. So no change.Does the increased personal allowance apply to pensioners? Yes, it certainly does. Pensioners pay income tax like everyone else, on their pension income, earnings (if any), interest from savings and dividends from investments.  And they get the benefit of the personal tax allowance too.Will this investment in ""40,000 new affordable homes"" be spread fairly and evenly across England?That will depend on which councils, housing associations and builders bid for the government's funds to pay for their plans.Any mention of tax measures on landlords' buy-to-let mortgage interest?No, the plans in the pipeline were not addressed. So you can assume the previously announced changes will come into effect. From April 2017, but phased in over four years, the traditional tax relief available to landlords, on their mortgage interest payments, will be reduced to just the basic income tax rate of 20%.What are the details re changes to flat-rate VAT scheme? The government says it will bring in ""a new 16.5% rate from 1 April 2017 for businesses with limited costs, such as many labour-only businesses. This will help level the playing field, while maintaining the accounting simplification for the small businesses that use the scheme as intended."" For those businesses affected, this will mean paying more. The government forecasts that this will bring in more than £100m a year extra, for the five years from 2017-18. The details are here.What are the benefit rates for 2017-18?The current rates for 2016-17 are all set out here and in this Department for Work and Pensions leaflet.New rates have not yet been published. However you may recall that back in 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne announced a freeze on some benefits to last for four years, from April 2016. Specifically, he said that working-age benefits would be frozen - including tax credits and local housing allowance, but maternity pay and disability benefits would be exempted. So, some of your benefits may not rise next year. With childcare, does that mean everyone will be entitled to 30 hours help from 2017 September?Not quite. If you have young children who need child care, the government is trying to make making good its 2015 election promise.Today the government said: ""Tax-Free Childcare will be introduced gradually from early 2017, with roll out beginning upon completion of the trial. Once the scheme is fully rolled out, the government will review its operation to ensure it is delivering as intended and to assess the benefit it is delivering for working parents."" So it will start next year.Remember, though, the government announced in the 2015 Autumn Spending Review that the new policy would not benefit families earning more than £100,000 a year.In July this year, HM Revenue & Customs published this guidance which said that ""All eligible parents will be able to join the scheme by the end of 2017.""So the end of next year is the official target for a full roll-out of the scheme.What happened to a possible change in Air Passenger Duty?The airport industry lobbied for the duty to be cut in half. It looks as if they were resoundingly ignored.Is there anything in it for savers? It always seems to be about keeping interest rates low these days.Actually, yes. National Savings & Investments (the Premium Bond people) will soon offer a three-year savings bond offering (probably) interest of 2.2%. The bond will have a minimum investment limit of £100 and a maximum  limit of £3,000. It will be available for 12 months from next spring.Does this mean I'll be taxed on my company mobile phone in future?There are complicated rules for the taxation (or not) of mobile phones supplied to staff by employers. You can enjoy them here: https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-mobile-phones/overviewThese are not being changed and cover most cases where someone is supplied with just one phone by their employer.What the government is changing are the rules where benefits-in-kind (such as an extra mobile phone) are supplied under a deal known as ""salary sacrifice"". If the phone is supplied under one of these - perhaps to another member of your family - you will have to pay tax on it in the future.The government says: ""The tax and employer national insurance advantages of salary sacrifice schemes will be removed from April 2017, except for arrangements relating to pensions (including advice), childcare, Cycle to Work and ultra-low emission cars.""

2016-11-23,Extremist loner,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38071894,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThrough his own words, the very few he has uttered, Thomas Mair has made clear his murder of the MP Jo Cox was politically motivated, the very definition of an act of terrorism, write Dominic Casciani and Daniel De Simone. Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey jury that on 16 June the two extremes of humanity - Mair's hatred and the goodness of Mrs Cox and those who rushed, in vain, to help her - had come face to face.Mair was born in Scotland in 1963 to parents who had married after he was conceived. When he was still a small boy, the family moved to a semi-detached house in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where he still lived at the time of the murder. He remained at the property, living first with his maternal grandparents, then, after his grandmother died, in 1996, alone.He attended a local college as a mature student and spent time as a volunteer gardener after attending a centre for adults with mental health problems.In a local newspaper interview on the topic, Mair said: ""Many people who suffer from mental illness are socially isolated and disconnected from society, feelings of worthlessness are also common, mainly caused by long-term unemployment.""Getting out of the house and meeting new people is a good thing, but more important in my view is doing physically demanding and useful labour.""In the days before Mrs Cox's murder, Mair would visit his local library and use the internet to work out how he was going to kill her. His chosen weapons were a knife and a small rifle usually used for pest control on farms. Mair did not have the permission required to possess the rifle. The police say it was stolen in Keighley last year. They are still investigating whether Mair was involved or got it from someone else - and who modified it to make it more likely to kill a human. But the jury was told he had watched a number of American videos showing men firing a similar sawn-off rifle.He also looked at web pages about members of the Ku Klux Klan and people murdered in the US because of their civil rights work. He worked his way through a list of political assassinations, including that of John F Kennedy and the 1990 IRA killing of Conservative MP Ian Gow. He read up on matricide, the crime of killing one's mother, political prisoners, ""lying in state"", coffins and arrangements for a pauper's funeral. And then he asked one of the members of staff about Mrs Cox's constituency surgeries at the library. No need to make an appointment, just turn up, the librarian said, pointing Mair towards a poster displaying the details. On 16 June, Mair left home wearing a white baseball cap and carrying a grey canvas shopping bag. On the street CCTV cameras, he looked like any another middle-aged shopper. He stood around near the library on Market Street, eating a Cadbury's chocolate flake. He was carrying a leaflet from the campaign to remain in the EU. The referendum was seven days away. Mrs Cox had been doing constituency work all day. Shortly before 13:00, she and two members of her constituency team drove up to the library to begin setting up for an hour of meeting the public to help solve their problems. As the MP emerged from the car, Mair fired his gun.He shouted: ""Britain first, this is for Britain. ""Britain will always come first. ""We are British independence. ""Make Britain independent.""Mrs Cox, thrown to the ground by the force of the attack, shouted to her assistants: ""Get away, you two.""Let him hurt me. ""Don't let him hurt you."" Her words drew Mair back in, and he attacked her with the knife. Bystander Bernard Carter Kenny, 78, ran to intervene. Mair stabbed him, and the pensioner collapsed in the entrance of a sandwich shop. Mair shot again at Mrs Cox. Rashid Hussain, a taxi driver, screamed at Mair to leave her alone. Mair threatened him and again shouted: ""Britain first.""David Honeybell, who had been waiting at the library to meet Mrs Cox, saw Mair stab and shoot the MP. ""I went back in the library and said, 'Call the police,'"" he tells BBC News.""He just turned away, walked down the street as if nothing had happened, just as if he had be going round for an afternoon stroll.""Outside the library, paramedics and a doctor desperately tried to save Mrs Cox. They performed an emergency thoracotomy - an extreme procedure to open the chest as part of resuscitation. Meanwhile, Mair strolled on. Another witness followed from a safe distance and directed the police to the killer. Officers rugby-tackled him, and, calmly, he confirmed he had weapons in the bag.When detectives searched Mair's home, they found it as methodically organised as his attack - but also a library of extreme nationalist and racist material. An ornamental Nazi eagle had pride of place on top of a bookshelf packed with far-right literature. In drawers, there were books about the SS and pamphlets about white supremacy. He had a vast collection of literature from the National Alliance, an American neo-Nazi group.All of this came as a shock to his next-door neighbour Katie Green. She remembers a man who had some mental health problems and some unusual habits. ""If you ever saw him in the garden, he always had the gloves on,"" she tells BBC News.""He shut the garden gate with his gloves on or a piece of tissue if he did not have them. If we turned the car round at the garages round the back and his door was open, he was always cleaning his kitchen - a precise kind of fellow.""Stephen Lees has known Mair for years, through his brother. ""He never showed any political interest at all, never mentioned it, not even to his brother,"" he tells BBC News.""It is shocking to think someone has got that much hatred, because he seemed a very normal lad.""The precise state of Mair's mind at the time of the attack remains unclear. He has largely refused to engage with the court process, including attempts to assess whether or not he is capable of standing trial on mental health grounds, or even to enter a plea of not guilty. He said little of use to defence lawyers appointed to ensure he received a fair trial. At his first appearance, he said his name was ""Death to traitors, freedom for Britain"". As far back as 1984, Mair was buying neo-Nazi publications, and he had letters published in a racist South African magazine. The Southern Poverty Law Centre, an American anti-fascist organisation, has published records showing Mair ordered books on improvised munitions and explosives from the neo-Nazi National Alliance's publishing imprint. Those orders were placed days after David Copeland had attempted to spark a ""race war"" in a series of bombings across London. But the mystery of Mair is he appears to have simply got on with forming and reinforcing his views with no contact to any of the known extremist organisations in the UK. There is no evidence of him having been identified at rallies or marches down the years. He was not prominent on social media. He was immersed in his books. Amid all the Nazi literature in Mair's home, was a book called SS Race Theory and Mate Selection Guidelines. ""Your wife should be at least as racially worthy as yourself,"" it says.""In your children, you live on.""Mair will go to prison childless. But the memory of Mrs Cox lives on, not least, through her children, whom she and her husband, Brendan, were raising to be model citizens: caring for each other and caring about a society built on goodness, not hate.

2016-11-23,Meeting the Jams,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38046784,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkYou could argue that Britain as a nation has something in common with the Jams - the new acronym of choice in Downing Street. People who are Just About Managing - the people that the prime minister says she will help. Listen to the chancellor. The UK's debt is ""eye-wateringly"" large, he says. There are ""sharp"" challenges ahead and inflation is expected to rise next year. Some might say that Britain is itself just about managing.Marine engineer Christopher Harroway is already noticing a rise in the cost of living. ""You realise from daily activities like going to do your shopping, fuel prices, everything, that it's a lot higher than it used to be,"" he says. ""A lot of people's wages don't match that as much now.""Life's hard at times, but I suppose you get by.""Christopher works at Dunston's Ship Repairs in Hull, where he has been employed for 12 years. He hopes to buy a house in the next few years, but he knows the mortgage will be higher than his rent is currently. He, like many others, would appreciate some government help to bridge the gap. When the chancellor unveils his Autumn Statement on Wednesday we will get our first, proper detailed look at the policies this government wishes to pursue, its priorities. We know - because the prime minister tells us - that ministers are determined to make the lives of the Jams better. But there is limited money available to help voters left behind by globalisation, those whose living standards could be further eroded next year by falling growth and rising prices. Outside Dunston's, another ship is preparing to leave, as the sun starts to rise over the Humber, and more vessels are coming into port. People have struggled in Hull for decades, but now lives are improving after a huge effort to rebuild the economy around the renewable energy sector. ""We're very much on the right trajectory for the first time in something like 35 years. Our unemployment is at record lows,"" says Mark Jones, the man who led Hull's regeneration at a time of central government cuts to local authority budgets.""The government is short of money, we know that. We are heading towards more fiscal devolution.""You overcome this, he says, by creating money locally - a fiscal base for the council. ""Having more buildings, more productive assets, a better public realm that attracts more investment, more business rates into the area which can help sustain some of our more disadvantaged communities.""If the government is to be successful in improving lives, it will surely need the help of local authorities like Hull.Across Yorkshire in a chilly Victorian factory building in Sheffield, Pippa Elliot is standing on a stool, firing thick black wool into a rug base.She set up her business recently and says there needs to be ""help for start-up businesses. I know the funding's disappeared. I've taken my savings and supported myself. If I wasn't in that position I wouldn't have done it"". Outside and down some slippery stairs the old brick chimney still stands proud above the site at Portland Works. This is where the world's first stainless steel was produced more than 100 years ago.  Pete Ledger at PML Silver Plating walks past with dozens of shiny forks and spoons dangling from lengths of wire. In the office, his daughter Emma Lawson - who is the company secretary but who ends up doing ""everything"", she says with a laugh - would like more help from government to bring an apprentice into the family business.""It would be nice to have some help as to how to employ someone in the industry,"" says Emma. ""I don't actually think there's anything out there. That would be beneficial."" Finally we head into the forge, in the same building, where Andy Cole, the only forger left, says: ""You've got to slow imports down. In 2011 - up to then - I had 12 employees, but the (cheap) imports crippled me and I had to shut the doors. ""We need some sort of trade barriers to cushion our employees."" On the dockside in Liverpool, Gary's Cafe is doing a good trade - like the city itself. Just as in Hull, Liverpool was depressed for many years but it has been attracting investment recently and improving many lives.  Gary, who owns the mobile cafe and has been operating on the same street corner for 29 years has seen the ups, the downs and now the ups again. ""I'm getting a bit of a better living,"" he says, handing over a cup of tea. ""Scouse hospitality."" But the government should ""give us some more money - help the council along - because to be honest the city council are so stretched"". That plea is likely to fall on deaf ears in the Treasury. The wish lists of those who are managing to get by are long and detailed. The chancellor has said that funding is not limitless and that choices have to be made. He will not be able to help everyone.   "
2016-11-23,'Farage for Washington',https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38062580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkUS President-elect Donald Trump has suggested UKIP leader Nigel Farage should be the UK's next ambassador in Washington. But how are leading diplomats chosen?Washington - along with postings to the UN, Paris and the EU - is among the most coveted jobs in the Diplomatic Service.To the constant refrain - particularly from politicians in London - that the ""special relationship"" is in rude health, life as UK ambassador in Washington is a round of parties, functions, high-level meetings and trips to the White House. Not to mention getting paid £184,999 a year.It would seem the ideal job for a big figure, one not shy of courting public attention. And Nigel Farage - interim leader of UKIP, friend of President-elect Donald Trump - would certainly fit that description.Mr Trump has tweeted his backing: ""Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!""The UK government is, to use diplomatic language, not entirely in accord. It has ruled out the idea, stating that current ambassador Sir Kim Darroch is ""very good"" and will be in Washington ""for some years"".Perhaps the most surprising element of Mr Trump's suggestion, for those reading about it in the UK, is that Mr Farage -  a politician not a diplomat - could be considered for the job.Sir Christopher Meyer, the UK's ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, says: ""The systems are very different. In the US many of the ambassadors are donors and people who have helped the president's election campaign. This is normal in the American system, but not in the UK.""The American Foreign Service Association says that, of the ambassadorial appointments during Barack Obama's presidency, 69.7% have been career diplomats and the remaining 30.3% have been political figures. Most of what are known as the ""plum"" jobs tend to go to the latter group.The current US ambassador in London, Matthew Barzun, was an internet entrepreneur who acted as national finance chairman for Mr Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.""I'm not absolutely opposed to the idea of political appointees in the UK too,"" says Sir Christopher. ""Often they are clever people with fresh ideas. As long as they have got good staff who understand the system, it can work very well.""There is no UK rule against political appointees as ambassadors. David Ormsby-Gore, a former Conservative minister, did the Washington job from 1961 to 1965. Labour supporter and former New Statesman editor John Freeman did the same from 1969 to 1971.In 1977, concerns of nepotism were raised when TV presenter and Times economics columnist Peter Jay became the UK's ambassador in Washington. He was the son-in-law of the then Prime Minister, James Callaghan.""That was particularly controversial at the time,"" said Richard Whitman, senior visiting fellow at the foreign affairs think tank Chatham House.In the UK, potential ambassadors, the vast majority of them career diplomats, are recommended by the Foreign Office and have to be approved by Buckingham Palace, as they have a dual role of representing the government and the Crown.It's a ""fairly straightforward"" process, says Prof Whitman. ""You can see someone who looks like they're going to be an ambassador as they come through the Diplomatic Service. The type of training they are given, usually across the civil service and in Number 10, getting a really wide experience, marks them out.""What you want, particularly for the Washington job, is people who are not just very good technical diplomats but very attuned politically.""This means sending back snippets of information you ""wouldn't see in the newspapers"", gained from formal meetings and informal chats, Prof Whitman adds. Ambassadors require high-level security vetting too.Although political appointees are more common in the US, the Senate has to confirm those selected. This can result in rejections and delays.Prof Whitman suggests the UK system, obviously less public, is also less confrontational. ""The government wouldn't propose someone who wasn't acceptable or appointable to the Palace,"" he says. ""I would describe ambassadors' development as a career-long vetting.""The Civil Service Commission says all appointments must be ""made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition"" to be ""lawful"".It adds: ""Merit means the appointment of the best available person judged against the essential criteria for the role. No-one should be appointed to a job unless they are competent to do it and the job must be offered to the person who would do it best.""The US has a tradition of appointing celebrities to ambassadorships. In fact, Mr Trump's first wife, Ivana Trump, has suggested her ex-husband should pick her to oversee diplomatic ties with the Czech Republic, where she was born and raised. ""They could not send a better US ambassador to Prague,"" Czech President Milos Zeman reportedly told her in a statement.The former child star Shirley Temple - dubbed ""Little Miss Miracle"" by President Franklin D Roosevelt for raising morale during the Great Depression - served in Ghana from 1974 to 1976.But Sir Christopher, who received languages training during his long civil service apprenticeship and has suggested a good diplomat needs ""a quick mind, a hard head, a strong stomach, a warm smile and a cold eye"", thinks his more focused training did him good.Despite the closeness of UK-US ties, ""you often have to play hardball,"" he says. ""A political appointee can work but what can't happen is allowing a foreign government to dictate who should be your ambassador. That's unacceptable."""
2016-11-23,Business beat,https://web.archive.org//web/20161123215934/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38057462,"There were no hecklers this year, more a respectful silence as the gathered audience listened to the big name.  And despite her talent for saying very little, and indeed, the prime minister's determination to give hardly anything away on her plans for Brexit, this morning at the CBI she did in the end say rather a lot. No surprises, when it comes to the big picture, the prime minister was abundantly clear (again) that she won't be pushed into giving more details of her plans for how we leave the EU and life afterward. That was despite the fact that she took to the stage moments after the CBI President who could not have been any clearer in making the organisation's demand for more information. It is five months since the referendum this week, but despite the growing pressure from business and in Westminster, she is not budging. The CBI, a lobby as powerful as they get, basically said, ""please, please, tell us what is going on"". Theresa May in response minutes later essentially said, ""not a chance"". But she did give some things away. While Downing Street denies it's a U-turn, the prime minister scotched any suggestion (including her own) that the government might make companies have workers sitting on their boards. One of the first proposals she made when she launched her bid to lead the country  was ""If I'm prime minister, we're going to change that system - and we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.""You wouldn't have been a fool for concluding that she meant that big firms would therefore have to have staff members on their boards. Not now, according to Downing Street. She said this morning that she never meant that firms would have to appoint workers directly to boards, although some companies may wish to do that.But there is no coincidence that the policy has undergone what you might politely call an evolution, after business was alarmed. Unions this afternoon have poked fun at what they see as a U-turn, the TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying ""If Mrs May says Brexit means Brexit, surely workers on boards means workers on boards"".The government is consulting on its plans. I understand the likely option is company boards to have one director whose sole responsibility is representing workers' views - we'll know in due course. The prime minister did recommit the government to the target of making British corporation tax - the tax on company profits - the lowest in the G20. It is scheduled to come down to 17 per cent in any case by the end of this Parliament. The trouble with her repeating the previous promise is that since it was made Donald Trump has emerged, with his promise to cut federal corporation tax to 15 per cent.It is not a direct comparison. But having said last night that the prime minister had to be taken at face value as she made that commitment, government sources today slapped it down with accusations of ""pure speculation"". But business leaders will have no doubt filed that promise away. Whether May meant it or not, she is on the record as making that promise, a fact not lost on the previous Chancellor, George Osborne, who made the 15 per cent proposal previously and was enjoying its re-emergence today.But what Theresa May did hint at today, and we are in the business of hunting for hints, was the possibility that there will be an interim agreement with the European Union to run after we leave, but before a final deal can be struck.This would risk the wrath of the Brexiteers. But while the specifics of a transitional agreement have not been discussed in Cabinet, one minister explained ""a reality check has started to happen"" and they suggested that a temporary deal ""may have to happen - it's a practical option"". No 10 sources are playing down the significance of today's comments with their familiar refrain - they're not ruling anything in, or anything out. But like the promise on corporation tax, that hint will be filed away by politicians on both sides - those who are looking to keep our ties to the EU as tight as possible, and those arguing for a fast, clean exit.  The relationship that Theresa May will have with the business community is one of the most important that she will have, particularly at a time of enormous political and economic uncertainty.Although business has welcomed her support and promises of extra government spending on research and development and infrastructure, they know that she is willing to criticise too - calling again for a minority of businesses who behave badly to get in line. One cabinet minister suggested that just as Tony Blair was willing to take on the unions, a Labour leader seeking to appeal to the centre by taking on his party's traditional supporters, Theresa May is keen to do the same, taking on business, a well of traditional Tory support. But these are early days, and probably not the last time Theresa May will stand on the CBI platform. So far there's a sense that they don't quite know what to make of her. And perhaps, she doesn't know quite what to make of them."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-24,Business leaders challenge May's pay plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38100757,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May's attempt to reform corporate pay and governance faces more challenges from business leaders.A report by the Big Innovation Centre rejects holding annual binding votes on pay and the publishing of pay ratios between chief executives and workers.The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay.This week, Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans to put worker representatives on boards.The prime minister set out her intention to strengthen corporate governance when she came to power in the summer. But some proposals have drawn criticism.Friday's BIC report - whose authors include Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane and Kingfisher non-executive director Clare Chapman - argues that action on pay is certainly needed to change executive behaviour and ""to rebuild trust"".But the report says that binding votes and pay ratios are the wrong way to do it, and would damage efforts to motivate and retain chief executives.""Pay ratios do not lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies, even within the same industry,"" the report says. ""Pay ratios may lead to pay being decoupled from performance.""And on the issue of binding votes, the report says: ""Theresa May, in a speech prior to becoming Prime Minister, indicated that there should be binding votes on executive pay. This has been interpreted by some as annual binding votes on pay outcomes, and policy proposals have been prepared by at least one Member of Parliament on this basis.""The report argues that annual binding votes would be a ""disproportionate response... and would be likely to have many negative unintended consequences"".However, it says that if a company's pay policy receives less than 75% support from shareholders in two consecutive years, that vote should be binding. Currently, votes on executive pay are held every three years.The BIC is backed by leading companies, academics and consultancy firms. Contributors to its research include Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, Prof Alex Edmans, a corporate governance expert at London Business School, and Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy.Given the leading names behind the report, its recommendations will be seen as a powerful contribution to the growing debate on corporate governance reforms.The recommendations include measures for ""simpler pay structures"". Instead of traditional performance-related pay and cash bonuses, the report calls for more use of share awards stretching over 5-7 years.There should also be more transparency in how pay is set and more consultation with employees to explain how and why the remuneration is set, the report says."
2016-11-24,Abuse inquiry 'handled assault claim badly',https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38095053,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHeads of the inquiry into child sexual abuse have been criticised by MPs for a ""wholly inadequate"" response to an internal allegation of sexual assault.The home affairs select committee said, given the inquiry's task, it should have treated the issue with ""rigour"".A woman on the inquiry team alleged she was groped in a lift at its offices.Inquiry chair Prof Alexis Jay, the fourth person to lead the inquiry, apologised for any unnecessary anxiety caused to victims or survivors.The troubled inquiry, launched by Theresa May when she was home secretary, has seen the departure of three chairs as well as its most senior and second-ranking counsel.In the latest setback, one of the largest victims' groups involved withdrew from the inquiry, calling it an ""unpalatable circus"". The move prompted calls for Prof Jay, who has the government's backing, to be replaced.Ben Emmerson QC, the most senior lawyer at the inquiry, resigned in September.The BBC's Newsnight programme has previously reported that the inquiry was told in September of a claim that Mr Emmerson had assaulted a woman working at its offices in a lift - a claim he has strenuously denied. The alleged victim did not want the incident investigated.In its report, the committee said it made no judgement on the claim, and suggested an external person could be appointed to examine the matter.""We are not in a position, and it is certainly not our responsibility, to assess either the facts of the case or the details of the processes that the inquiry pursued,"" the report said.""However, we do not believe that IICSA [the inquiry] has taken seriously enough its responsibility to pursue allegations of bullying or disclosures of sexual assault within the inquiry,"" it added.""Nor do we believe it has done enough to demonstrate publicly that it has a robust approach to such matters.""In a letter published by the committee alongside its report, Hugh Davies QC, a barrister who worked for the inquiry until December last year, said as a body judging how institutions dealt with this sort of allegation, it should ""expect to be judged by the same standards it will doubtless set for others"".Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the select committee, said the inquiry needed to sort out its problems fast and be less defensive about what had gone wrong.She said it was ""shameful"" that the previous chair, Dame Lowell Goddard, was refusing to give oral evidence about her sudden resignation this summer.The New Zealand high court judge previously told the committee that for her to be summoned would compromise the inquiry's ""independence and integrity"".MPs also urged the inquiry team to appoint new lawyers as soon as possible and suggested it split its workload into two strands - legal matters and child protection. Ms Cooper said: ""We found there was an unresolved tension over how far the inquiry should focus on uncovering the truth about past abuse and cover-ups and how far it should focus on current child protection policies. ""Both are important but they need different skills, experience and styles of work.""This inquiry is far too important to be sunk by problems. That's why urgent action is needed to sort them out. Survivors of abuse deserve nothing less."" In response, Prof Jay said an external senior legal figure would be invited to review some of the issues raised in the committee's report.""While I am confident that our safeguarding and dignity at work procedures are robust, I recognise the impact of recent speculation and commentary about them,"" she said.""Nobody is more determined to deliver a successful inquiry on behalf of victims, survivors and the wider public than the panel and myself.""We recognise that the past few months have been difficult for the inquiry and for the victims and survivors who have placed their trust in it.""I am personally sorry for any unnecessary anxiety the inquiry may have caused to victims and survivors during this transitional period.""She is expected to publish a review of how the inquiry operates in the coming weeks."
2016-11-24,Government warned on Heathrow emissions,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38098451,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPlans to expand Heathrow Airport are set to breach the government’s climate change laws, advisers have warned.The Committee on Climate Change says the business plan for Heathrow projects a 15% increase in aviation emissions by 2050.If that increase is allowed, members say, ministers will have to squeeze even deeper emissions cuts from other sectors of the economy.The government said it was determined to keep to its climate change targets. The Committee on Climate Change is a statutory body set up to advise the UK government on emissions targets.It warns that creating the space for aviation emissions to grow will impose unbearable extra emissions reductions on sectors like steel-making, motoring and home heating.The committee also says that in making the decision to allow a third runway at Heathrow, ministers appear to have jettisoned their policy that aviation emissions in 2050 would be frozen at 2005 levels.Its chair, Lord Deben, wrote to the Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark, saying: “If emissions from aviation are now anticipated to be higher than 2005, then all other sectors would have to prepare for correspondingly higher emissions reductions.“Aviation emissions at 2005 levels already imply an 85% reduction in other sectors. My committee has limited confidence about the options (for achieving the compensatory cuts needed).”Already since 1990, aviation emissions have doubled while economy-wide emissions have reduced by more than a third. Ministers see aviation as a special case because low-carbon technology for planes is not well advanced.The committee says the Department for Transport appears to be planning to solve the aviation overshoot by buying permits to pollute from poor countries which have low levels of CO2 emissions.This is permitted internationally under a new code recently agreed by the aviation industry. But it is a departure from the government’s own existing policy - and rules stipulate that the change should have been checked with the committee before being agreed.A committee spokesman told BBC News: “The committee has consistently said the government should not plan to use credits to meet the 2050 target because these credits may not be available in the future and they may not be cheap.”Doug Parr from Greenpeace said the affair showed climate change was still an afterthought from a government pursuing business as usual.He said: “What ministers know full well but don't want to admit is that a third runway means other sectors of the economy will have to bear the costs of further carbon cuts - whether it’s regional airports or the manufacturing and steel industries. “If that's the plan, it's time ministers came clean about it with those concerned and the British public.""A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told BBC News: ""The government agrees with the Airports Commission's assessment that a new runway at Heathrow can be delivered within the UK's carbon obligations.""We are considering how we will continue to reduce our emissions across the economy through the 2020s and will set this out in our emissions reduction plan, which will send an important signal to the markets, businesses and investors. ""Our commitment to meeting our Climate Change Act target of an at least 80% emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 is as strong as ever.""But it’s not just on aviation that climate policies are struggling. The government’s long-awaited master plan for reducing long-term emissions has been delayed again - until early 2017. The government did signal help for electric vehicles in the Autumn Statement, although critics say it has much more to do. But the biggest challenge is the UK’s leaky housing stock: since the government scrapped its ill-fated Green Deal programme of home insulation it has had no nationwide plan to improve comfort and reduce emissions from existing homes.Follow Roger @rharrabin"
2016-11-24,EU leaders 'not bluffing' over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38100561,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEU leaders are not ""bluffing"" when they say the UK will be left without access to the single market when it leaves the bloc if there is no free movement of people, Malta's prime minister says.Joseph Muscat, whose country assumes the EU's presidency in January, told the BBC ""this is really and truly our position and I don't see it changing"".Theresa May says the UK will begin the legal process to leave the EU by March.Mr Muscat said talks on the details of a ""new relationship"" could be delayed.Much political debate has focused on the possibility of a ""soft"" Brexit - the UK retaining some form of membership of the single market in exchange for conceding some control over immigration - and ""hard Brexit"" - leaving the single market but having fuller control over migration.But Mr Muscat said the UK and EU needed to first reach agreement on a range of other details once Mrs May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.He said these included the bill the UK must pay before leaving, establishing what will happen to the UK-Republic of Ireland border and working out interim arrangements on issues like security.Steering Britain out of the EUAll you need to know about the UK leaving the EUWhat are the options?Asked about a suggestion from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that the UK could in theory stay in single market and place limits on the freedom of movement of EU citizens, Mr Muscat told the BBC ""it's just not happening"".He added: ""All of us have been pretty clear in our approach that we want a fair deal for the UK but that kind of fair deal can't translate itself into a superior deal.""I know that there is absolutely no bluffing from the European side, at least in the council meetings I have attended, saying 'we will start in this position and then we will soften up'. ""No, this is really and truly our position.""He acknowledged the talks could get ""complicated"" and amount to a ""bit of a Catch 22 - it won't be a situation when one side gains and the other side loses. ""We are going to lose something but there will not be a situation when the UK has a better deal than it has today"".Mr Muscat also reiterated the view that even when a final or interim deal is struck between EU leaders and Britain, the European Parliament may decide to veto it in 2019.His comments come days after the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis described his meeting with the European Parliament's chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt as a ""good start"".Mr Davis said their pre-negotiations discussion had been able to cover structures and how both sides propose to approach the Brexit talks, adding a deal was possible that was in the interests of the EU and the UK. The UK government has said it does not want to reveal its negotiating hand on Brexit before the talks take place."
2016-11-24,Thatcher 'resisted' Howe kitchen plea,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38101020,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkMargaret Thatcher was reluctant to allow her first Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe to spend £4,150 on a new kitchen, newly-released papers show.The papers from 1979 show Edna Healey, wife of Sir Geoffrey's predecessor, warned of the ""antediluvian"" room at Number 11 Downing Street.Three calls were made to ""nag"" Mrs Thatcher to approve the refurbishment.Replies from a private secretary suggest the PM may have been reluctant to become involved amid spending cuts.The exchanges are revealed in the late chancellor's secret papers in the National Archives from 1979-1983.They show his predecessor Denis Healey was the first person to contact Sir Geoffrey after he was appointed after the Conservative landslide general election win. But the new chancellor was said to be even more surprised to hear Mr Healey was passing on a message from his wife, Edna, to Sir Geoffrey's wife, Elspeth, warning her not to move into the flat at Number 11 unless the kitchen was updated.An estimate for the work was submitted but it took three calls by Treasury officials over a three month period to elicit a reply from Mrs Thatcher's staff.In his reply, one of Mrs Thatcher's private secretaries, Colin Paterson, wrote: ""I am very sorry that this has been so long outstanding. I was under the impression that the prime minister had had a word with the chancellor.""If not, I am sure that she would wish to leave this to the chancellor's discretion, keeping in mind how sensitive expenditure of this kind can be.""Another document in the National Archives outlines radical plans to end universal free healthcare.The document stamped ""secret"" was called, in keeping with films and books of that era, ""The Omega Project"". Civil servants noted that ""for the majority it would represent the abolition of the NHS"".  But in spite of what was described as the nearest thing to a Cabinet riot in the history of the Thatcher administration,  the prime minister secretly pressed ahead with the plans - before later backing down.

In America the revolution is total. Not only have the people spoken and won, but the old administration, Obama and all those ghastly people, are out and the Trump people are in.""In this country, the people have spoken, but the same players have just been shuffled around the chess board and we are still being run by the career professional political class.""I am not sure what is going to happen over the course of the next couple of years but I suspect there's another big seismic shock in British politics perhaps going to come at the next election.""I suspect that the Conservative Party is not fit for the legacy of Brexit. I suspect there is going to be a genuine realignment of British politics over the course of the next three or four years.""It is unfinished business - the people have spoken but the establishment don't want to listen. There are great battles to be fought and I'm going to go on fighting those battles.""The reception at the Ritz was hosted by millionaire Arron Banks, who was thanked by Mr Farage for bankrolling the Leave.EU campaign. On speed dial?Also present were Conservative MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and Peter Bone, Labour Leave campaigner and donor John Mills and UKIP leadership candidate Paul Nuttall.Asked if he would back Mr Farage to be the UK ambassador to the US, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""Mr Farage's relationship with Mr Trump could be beneficial for the country but I am not sure he should be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.""Mr Farage is certainly extraordinary in his own way but I think that being plenipotentiary as well may be a bit too much.""Mr Hammond also dampened any ambassadorial ambitions Mr Farage might have in an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain. ""It isn't for other countries to decide who we appoint as ambassadors - and if I ever need any advice from Nigel Farage, I've got his number and I'll give him a call,"" he said. ""Tell him not to hold his breath.""Mr Farage, who has denied reports that he plans to emigrate to the US, recalled that he had joined Mr Banks and other leading Brexiteers at the Ritz on the morning after the 23 June referendum for a victory breakfast of Champagne and kippers - a reference to the nickname for UKIP supporters.He said: ""When people look back in 100 or 200 years, 2016 will be seen as one of the great historic years - a year of big political revolution.""Brexit was the first brick knocked out of the establishment wall and then look what we got on 8 November. The election of 'The Donald' was something of a completely different order.""To cheers he said: ""For those of you who aren't particularly happy with what happened in 2016, I've got some really bad news for you - it's going to get a bloody sight worse next year."""

We won't get into second guessing them.""In his statement, Mr Hammond promised to invest £23bn on ""innovation and infrastructure"" over the next five years, with more money for roads, broadband and regional development.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's a downward path in borrowing. We need to keep the downward path on borrowing... But we also need to invest in our economy, to generate the revenue that will drive down the debt.""Describing economic forecasting as ""not a precise science"", Mr Hammond said of the OBR's forecast: ""We should think of it as one of the possible range of outcomes we need to plan for.""He added: ""We have a very strong foundation on which to build.""Mr Hammond also said: ""We should have a plan which both invests in our economy and puts a little aside for the possibility of a slightly more rainy day next year or the year after.""Uncertainty was ""not just about"" Brexit but the change of US government when Donald Trump takes office and the growth rate of the Chinese economy, he added.Labour said the Autumn Statement offered no hope for the future after six ""wasted"" years.Among Mr Hammond's announcements were:The speech also triggered questions about the future of the so-called ""triple lock"" protection for state pensions, while campaigners criticised the lack of extra funding for social care.The triple-lock guarantees that state pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.Mr Hammond said the government would meet this pledge, adding: ""But as we look ahead to the next Parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability.""Former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb backed a review of the mechanism after 2020.He told the BBC: ""The fiscal impact of the triple lock is not something anyone can dismiss lightly and if we are serious about ensuring that our welfare system remains affordable in the very long term then my own view is that the triple lock has served its purpose and probably needs to get amended, to ensure that we don't have to keep going back to working age families and squeezing the same people's incomes time and again.""Meanwhile health and social care leaders have condemned the statement for a ""missed opportunity"" to announce new investment. For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell told BBC One's Breakfast that although he welcomed the government ""moving on investment policy"" there had been ""mismanagement of the economy over the last six years"". ""I find it extremely worrying that they've used the last six years with austerity measures and instead of investing they've been cutting, and as a result of that they're unprepared and ill-equipped for Brexit.""The SNP said Mr Hammond had offered little on Brexit, which it called the ""elephant in the room"".Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""The government's mishandling of Brexit is hitting those on lower and middle incomes the hardest.""He added that ""rhetoric"" about helping those ""just about managing"" had not resulted in action, creating ""surprising and massive disappointment"".But UKIP said billions were being wasted by the government ""delaying"" the UK's exit from the EU.Plaid Cymru said there was little in the statement to help rebuild the Welsh economy and close the wage gap with England.If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question.

2016-11-24,Workers' pay growth prospects 'dreadful',https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38090977,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe outlook for wages is ""dreadful"" with the squeeze on pay lasting for more than 10 years, independent economists have said.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said workers would earn less in real wages in 2021 than they did in 2008.Other analysis shows the biggest losers between now and 2020 will be lower income families, with the poorest third likely to see incomes drop.Chancellor Philip Hammond said millions of new jobs had been created.Defending his Autumn Statement plans, the chancellor told Radio 4's Today programme that the government had brought job growth. It was investing for the future, preparing for a ""rainy day"", and government borrowing was on a ""downward path"", he added.In its analysis of the Autumn Statement, the independent think tank, the IFS, said workers would earn less in real wages in 2021 than they did in 2008.""This has, for sure, been the worst decade for living standards certainly since the last war and probably since the 1920s,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS. ""We have seen no increase in average incomes so far and it does not look like we are going to get much of an increase over the next four or five years either.""The ""outlook for living standards and for the public finances has deteriorated pretty sharply over the last nine months"", he added.Real average earnings - which factor in the rising cost of living - were forecast to rise by less than 5% between now and 2021. That forecast is 3.7% lower than was projected in March.""Half of the wage growth projected for the next five years back in March is not now projected to happen. On these projections real wages will, remarkably, still be below their 2008 levels in 2021,"" Mr Johnson said.""One cannot stress enough how dreadful that is - more than a decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years.""The biggest impact on income in recent years, according to the IFS, has been felt by younger workers. Those aged 60 and over, in contrast, have seen living standards rise.  The squeeze on living standards could be worse during this Parliament than between 2010 and 2015, suggests the Resolution Foundation think tank. which campaigns for people on low and middle incomes.Lower growth in pay, an accelerating rise in the cost of living, and welfare changes such as a freeze on working age benefits all combined to show that incomes on average would only grow by 0.2% a year, it said.This compares to a rise of 0.5% during the coalition government years - a period of austerity in the aftermath of the financial crisis.""Taking all this together we can look at the outlook for family incomes in the coming years, and it paints a grim picture,"" the think tank said.Significantly, given the government's focus on ""just about managing"" families, the data shows that lower income families will be worse off.The Foundation said the poorest 10% would see an income hit of more than 3% by 2020 as a result of tax and welfare policies.""While top earners were hit the hardest following the financial crisis, the big difference looking forward is that the biggest losers are lower income families, with the entire bottom third of the income distribution set to see incomes fall in the years ahead,"" the Foundation said.The Treasury's own analysis, published alongside the Autumn Statement, shows that the poorest 30% of households will see a negative impact on incomes from tax, welfare and public spending measures by 2019-20. Primarily, this is a result of the main working age benefits and tax credits being frozen in cash terms for four years from April 2016. That includes entitlements such as jobseeker's allowance and income support. That income freeze is forecast to coincide with an acceleration in inflation, pushing up the cost of living.The chancellor offered some help to the lowest paid with changes to Universal Credit - the new umbrella benefit gradually being introduced across the UK.Mr Hammond announced a reduction in the rate at which the benefit is withdrawn from people when they start work. The Resolution Foundation report said this would have relatively little impact on family finances.""When set against all other policy changes announced since the 2015 election, the Autumn Statement only undoes 7% of the hit from benefit cuts to the bottom half of the income distribution,"" it said.Middle-income families will see some rises in income, but by no more than 1%, the Treasury documents show. The richest 10% will see the biggest hit to incomes.More broadly, the IFS said that the OBR had forecast that national income in 2020-21 would be £30bn lower than projected in March - the equivalent to £1,000 per household.Among Mr Hammond's announcements were:The IFS said that Mr Hammond had clearly put whatever money he had into long-term plans.""The clear prioritisation by Mr Hammond to direct most of what largesse he felt able to afford to paying for additional investment spending - roads, housing, research and development - to support the economy in the long run, rather than to pay to support the incomes of the ""just-about-managing"", or indeed public services, in the short run,"" Mr Johnson said.If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question.

Meanwhile, Sir John Major, another former PM, urged the ""solid centre"" to speak out against ""extremes"".There has been speculation that Mr Blair, who won three general elections for Labour, will make a return to mainstream politics, having mostly avoided the limelight since leaving Downing Street after 10 years as prime minister in 2007.This speculation increased when he announced he was closing most of his commercial operations to focus on philanthropic work.He has also said the public faces a choice between a government pursuing a ""hard Brexit"" and an ""ultra-left"" Labour Party with out-of-date policies.But Mr Blair told the New Statesman ""what I'm doing is to spend more time not in the frontline of politics, because I have no intention of going back to the frontline of politics"", rather he was ""trying to create the space for a political debate about where modern Western democracies go and where the progressive forces particularly find their place"".He said: ""I'm dismayed by the state of Western politics, but also incredibly motivated by it. I think, in Britain today, you've got millions of effectively politically homeless people.""Mr Blair added: ""I can't come into frontline politics. There's just too much hostility, and also there are elements of the media who would literally move to destroy mode if I tried to do that.""He denied reports that he had called Theresa May a ""lightweight"", describing the prime minister instead as ""a very solid, sensible person"" who had a very difficult hand to play.And, on Mr Corbyn, Labour's leader since last year, he said: ""I did not call Jeremy Corbyn 'a nutter'. I don't think he's a nutter. I just think he is someone on the far left of politics and he's been consistent for the last 35 years that I've known him, which is fine.""Meanwhile, speaking at a dinner in Westminster on Wednesday, Sir John Major, Conservative Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, called for the 48% of people who voted against Brexit in June's referendum to have their views considered.""The tyranny of the majority has never applied in a democracy and it should not apply in this particular democracy,"" he said, according to former BBC parliamentary correspondent Robert Orchard, who attended the event.Sir John argued that Parliament would have to ratify whatever deal was finally reached by the Brexit negotiators and there could then be a case for a second referendum, depending on the deal on offer. He said: ""We need to lift our eyes away from the philosophical dislike that some people feel for Europe and towards the practical implications of what our government must negotiate in the next few years.""Sir John added: ""In an age when the extremes of politics are rising, the solid centre of opinion should speak out for our values, for our future, and all that is good about our society. Now is not the time for silence... we should speak out."""
2016-11-24,Lansley warns of 'difficult' NHS years,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38095435,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA former health secretary says an ""incredibly difficult"" two years await the NHS and social care in England.Lord Lansley, health secretary from 2010-12, said he was ""disappointed"" that more funding was not announced in the Autumn Statement.Tory council leader Izzi Seccombe said funding was needed now and councils had been ""cut to the bone"".But Prime Minister Theresa May said ministers were already working to ease the situation.Funding cuts to council-run social care in England have been blamed for a big increase in patients stuck in hospital beds because care cannot be arranged elsewhere.But the chancellor did not specifically offer new resources either for the NHS or social care when outlining the Treasury's plans on Wednesday, only confirming that ministers would be sticking with departmental spending announced last year.Speaking in the debate following his statement, Mr Hammond referred to an extra £10bn in money for the NHS by 2020-21 - which itself has been questioned by the health select committee and others.You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.

            Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.Lord Lansley, who was health secretary during the early years of the coalition government, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he had thought ""a substantial change in departmental expenditure was pretty unlikely"" in Wednesday's statement.But he added: ""Not being surprised doesn't mean I wasn't disappointed. The next two years are going to be incredibly difficult and I think the time is now for trying to put some measures in place to try and help health and social care through those next two years.""He said improving social care provision could help tackle many of the ""underlying problems"" of the NHS: ""I don't think that necessarily demands a lot of extra public funds, what it does mean however is the implementation of the plan that we put together in the last Parliament from the Dilnot Commission.""The independent commission recommended that social care costs be capped at £35,000 so people did not face losing much of their assets - Lord Lansley said it was not implemented at the time ""because the Treasury didn't like it"".The government allowed councils to increase council tax by 2% this year to spend on care - but councils have claimed this is not enough to plug the shortfall in their care budgets because of the wider squeeze on their funding.Speaking on Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I recognise the concerns and challenges around social care. By the end of this parliament, the local authorities will have £3.5bn more to spend on social care and of course we're putting more money into the health service as well. ""But we need to see the health service and social care working together that's why the health secretary and the local communities secretary are appraised of the need for the challenges faced and are looking at this issue.""NHS: Budget controlled by NHS England and pays for hospitals, GPs, district nursing and mental health care. Services are provided free at the point of need.Care: Budget controlled by councils and pays for care home and nursing home places as well as support in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing. Services are means-tested so only the poorest get help towards their costs. But Conservative Warwickshire County Council leader Izzi Seccombe told the BBC councils had been ""cut to the bone"" and the funds available did not meet the demands of paying a national living wage as well as the needs of an increasing elderly population.""By the end of 2020 we will see that amount coming in but the need is now, it is a tapered amount which will increase to the end of 2020 - right now we have a £1.3bn gap which is not being funded.""And Siva Anandaciva, head of analysis at NHS Providers which represents NHS trusts, said funding was failing to keep pace with soaring demand for NHS services - illustrated by longer A&E and operation waiting times and fewer people getting council-funded social care. The lack of announcement from the chancellor had been ""very disappointing"".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had been ""utterly astonished"" there had been no a mention of the of the NHS or of social care. ""There's an NHS funding crisis and there's a social care crisis in Britain. The solution has to be more money going in to it to pay for the services that are necessary and to reduce the level of bed blocking."""

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-24,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

But is this unparliamentary - or even bad manners - these days?It was John McDonnell's big day. The shadow chancellor stood at the House of Commons despatch box at 13.20 GMT to coruscate Philip Hammond over his Autumn Statement.Labour MPs were rapt as he did so. Some by his oratory; others, it seems, by the electronic devices in their hands. As the picture above shows, quite a few MPs, even some of his front bench colleagues, used their smartphones while he spoke.As the next picture shows, the activity was not confined to one side, Business Secretary Greg Clark looking at his while Mr Hammond answered questions.And even Mr McDonnell himself was distracted at one point by a mobile phone held by his shadow Treasury team colleague Jonathan Reynolds. Speaker John Bercow has previously warned MPs not to ""fiddle"" with their phones ""ostentatiously"" and suggested they go outside if they really can't resist the temptation.But is it right that this has to be spelt out in one of the world's premier debating chambers, where argument is supposed to be of paramount importance? Where Gladstone and Disraeli were supreme, where Churchill guided a nation through its most challenging times?Well, since 2007, Commons rules have stated that MPs can use mobiles ""to keep up to date with emails... provided that it causes no disturbance"".It sounds like a quaint provision today. Times have changed, as the Commons Procedure Committee notes: ""There are many new devices, including portable 'tablet' computers such as iPads or smartphones, which were not known to the Modernisation Committee which drew up the report which led to the House's resolution.""There are also new uses of technology, for example Twitter, which were similarly unknown but on which the Speaker and the Chair of any committee may be expected to rule, using the existing resolution as a guideline.""Conservative MP Nigel Mills issued an apology in 2014 for playing the mobile puzzle game Candy Crush Saga during a Commons committee hearing.Generally, though, tweeting from inside the chamber is seen as acceptable.Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told BBC 5 live: ""The world moves on. But it's not about being obvious, is it? It's about ensuring that you be discreet.""If he thought an MP was tapping away and staring downwards a little too noticeably, he would give them ""a nudge"", rather than shout across the chamber, he said.Mr Hoyle added: ""People want to stay in touch with the outside world now. They want to tell them what's going on. It's about keeping the balance right....""Everything moves on, as we know, in this world. When people talk to each other through a device without even speaking, you've got to wonder where does society end up. I hope we don't lose the ability to talk to each other.""Mr Hoyle also acknowledged that the guilty verdict following the trial of Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox had come through about an hour before Mr McDonnell began speaking, meaning there was more focus on news sites and social media than usual.But the rules are stronger in some other countries, irrespective of circumstance. In Greece, electronic devices are banned from the plenary hall, while the Finnish chamber prohibits the use of laptops.In the US, Congress has a rule stating: ""A person on the floor of the House may not smoke or use a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.""Mr McDonnell, when asked about the Autumn Statement scenes, told Sky News: ""What they do now in the Commons, and I'm not sure how this goes down with the general public, is that a lot of them will be tweeting their comments out about what's being said and they'll be responding to tweets etc.""It's changed the nature of the chamber itself... It's happening consistently now and you see it on all political parties too,""If answering emails is distracting, social media is more so.The Commons authorities recognise this: ""As an example of a practice which could not have been predicted by the Modernisation Committee in 2007, tweeting could hardly be bettered.""The procedure committee says it would be ""inconsistent"" to allow tweeting from the gallery overlooking the Commons but ban it from inside the chamber.But it urges MPs to ""use their good sense and behave with courtesy, particularly in not tweeting messages which would be disorderly if said in the House"".At least they are showing themselves to be in touch with normal life.Be thankful that none of them were gurning, thumbs up with arms around one another - selfies are a huge no-no, photography within the Palace of Westminster requiring prior permission."

2016-11-24,Brexit in the (EU) press,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38091976,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNewspaper commentators are debating whether other European countries can exploit any business flight from London as the process of the UK leaving the European Union begins.In a week when the forthcoming presidential election dominates the media, France's centre-left Le Monde still manages extensive coverage of Brexit developments.Its British correspondent Eric Albert is gloomy about the chances of an investment-led recovery after a visit to the northeast, where he saw high-tech jobs at one firm migrating to its subsidiary in Stuttgart. He says ""any recovery plan will be limited"" by Britain's straitened economic circumstances.In Austria, Karl Gaulhoer of Die Presse thinks the British government is cooking up a ""perfect recipe for a lose-lose Brexit"".He dismisses the ""few hundred jobs"" Facebook is creating in London and the incentives to the Nissan carmaker, saying a quick visit to the City of London shows people ""slowly packing their bags"".""Brexit certainly weakens the EU politically, but this self-declared divorce battle is cutting into Britain's economic flesh"".Le Monde's economics reporter Isabelle Chaperon thinks this could be good news for France, as the country's Strategic Investment Council this week saw more interest from financial and IT companies than usual.A representative of the Indian computer firm Infosys that employs far more people in Britain than France told her that, since the Brexit vote, they are now looking at Marseilles as an African business hub.Other business analysts told Le Monde that there is a chance for Paris to become a ""strong alternative to London"" - as long as France liberalises its tax regime.Nonetheless, the director of French Square, a French business incubator, told conservative Le Figaro that London remains the key city for start-ups.""London is an essential step for a start-up, often the first before tackling the US market, but also a test in what is a particularly competitive international market,"" said Charles Van Overmeire. The French Catholic paper La Croix puts Theresa May on its front page to flag up an article on whether the British prime minister is turning her back on the free-market consensus in favour of state intervention and immigration controls.It concludes that the conflicts in the government over hard or soft Brexit options explain Mrs May's ""sometimes erratic decisions"", and that in the end ""she may be so absorbed by Brexit that she will not have time for other matters"". German papers pursue Mrs May's pledge to have the lowest corporate taxes among the G20 countries, especially after she came in for stern criticism from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.Centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung saw this as part of an industrial and investment strategy aimed at making post-Brexit Britain attractive to investors in the ""robotics, artificial intelligence and industrial biotechnology fields"". But Bastian Brinkmann of the centre-left Sueddeutsche Zeitung is less phlegmatic, accusing Mrs May of ""declaring a tax war that will drag the rest of the EU into the abyss, just as most countries have come to their senses and are making an effort to fight tax evasion"".While many commentators point to confusion in London over Brexit, the paper's Brussels correspondent Daniel Broessler sees little sign of anything but ""scrambling"" in the approach to Brexit of the remaining EU states.It is clear that ""all leads converge on Michel Barnier"", the Commission's chief Brexit negotiator, but Mr Broessler says EU member states are unhappy with being ""merely informed through the sherpa system"" of what is going on, and that the role of the European Parliament in the process has not yet been clarified.In Italy, Antonio Armellini of Corriere della Sera also sees continuing problems with British and EU demands on the freedom of the movement of financial services and labour, seeing them as reflections of ""competing visions - Britain's trading bloc, and the European Union's political project"".""Germany's Angela Merkel doesn't want confrontation but, in a difficult election year, cannot afford to abandon EU orthodoxy,"" he says, while the Central European Visegrad Group ""has no hesitation when it comes to the fundamental freedom of movement"".Jedrzej Bielecki in Poland's Rzeczpospolita also thinks Mrs May ""cannot reconcile"" migration limits and full access to the single market.He is convinced that the EU will not relent on these points, ""because if it weakens the single market, nothing will remain of integration"".BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2016-11-24,Belt tightening,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38089190,"The size of the challenge facing a chancellor who has pledged an economy ""that works for everyone"" is becoming increasingly clear.And it is not just down to Brexit.After an Autumn Statement which abandoned pledges to hit a government budget surplus by 2020, new analysis claims the squeeze on living standards could be worse during this Parliament than between 2010 and 2015.The report by the Resolution Foundation says lower earnings and higher inflation could mean incomes growing less than half as fast between 2015 and 2020 compared to the years following the financial crisis and the recession that followed.It also says that the ""jobs miracle"" which saw unemployment fall below 5% ""would not be repeated"".The figures reveal the difficult position the government could find itself in by the next election after its pledge to support those who feel themselves to be ""just about managing"".The Resolution Foundation study said the freeze on benefits and rising inflation could mean the bottom third of earners seeing their incomes fall.The findings of the study are echoed in the Treasury's own ""distributional analysis"" which looks at the impact of tax, welfare and public spending pledges contained in the Autumn Statement.Those charts say that the bottom 30% of earners are likely to be worse off.Only the top 10% of earners will see as significant a hit, with middle income families slightly better off by 2020.The Resolution Foundation report, to be released later this morning and seen by the BBC, says: ""The weak outlook for real average earnings, which the OBR [the Office for Budget Responsibility] forecasts to be £830 lower in 2020 than previously expected, means that the decade from 2010 to 2020 is set to be the weakest one for wage growth since the 1900s.""Real weekly earnings are forecast to grow by just 1.6% over the decade, compared to 12.7% in the 2000s and over 20% in every other decade since the 1920s.""Sources close to Mr Hammond have told me the chancellor is well aware of the difficult economic situation he faces and say that is why he has made increases in UK productivity his priority.If through investment in skills and infrastructure he can create the conditions to allow the economy to perform better, then the OBR's forecasts may prove too gloomy.Interestingly, the chancellor relaxed the government's spending rules not to reverse the benefits freeze or cut taxes, but to invest in infrastructure (such as new roads) and ""innovation"", in short research and development skills.Economic models suggest there is a direct relationship between infrastructure spending, skills investment and better economic growth and therefore wage increases.Weak productivity growth was a major problem for the UK economy well before the vote to leave the European Union.But, although the government announced increased spending yesterday, if private sector investment falls due to the uncertainty following the Brexit decision, then that could more than wipe out all of the fresh money being offered by the government."
2016-11-24,Final ordeal,https://web.archive.org//web/20161125065642/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38077303,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLady (Diana) Brittan's husband, ex-Home Secretary Lord (Leon) Brittan, died in January 2015 with an allegation that he'd raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967 hanging over him. Months after his death, the Metropolitan Police said that, had he been alive, he would not have been prosecuted, and apologised for its handling of the case. Here, for the first time, Lady Brittan describes the ordeal she endured.I went to visit him when he was recovering from a really quite a serious operation related to the cancer he had. He was lying in hospital. He said: ""I've just been rung by the police.""  I said: ""What's it about?"" He said: ""I'm not terribly sure, but I've just said to them 'I'll ring my lawyers'.""  And then the lawyers rang me and they said to me 'This is an old rape allegation, 47 years old' against Leon.I first met Leon in 1973, although we didn't get married until 1980. I just could not believe that this was him - it was not the man that I knew.He went to the lawyer's office when he came out of hospital. They discussed what they should do. I was not in the room at the time. And then about a couple of weeks later he was interviewed under caution in the office of the lawyer.  He was asked no supplementary questions at all - in fact, he was asked practically no questions. It was a very short interview and at the end of it he felt absolutely assured in his own mind that that would be the end of the matter.A week or two later, I remember being rung up by the BBC on a Saturday night saying this is all going public tomorrow, what would I say?  He was not at all well. After all, he'd had one huge operation, a number of weeks in intensive care and then this second operation. We were trying to enjoy a weekend up in Yorkshire but of course the gate was absolutely besieged by press. I was chased by a car - a very, very frightening thing - in the Yorkshire lanes. I had to try and find somewhere to go to where I couldn't be followed.It was the weekend the Tour de France was in Yorkshire. It was not easy for Leon to go into the local town and deal with pointing fingers and all the rest of it, although people were extremely supportive of him on that particular occasion.  I was absolutely certain that when he said that this allegation was without foundation, that was true.He got iller and iller and iller, and of course he died in the beginning of 2015 when some of the other things had started appearing in the press. He would never say anything to me, but I cannot believe from what he said to my daughters that he was not affected by it all. He was a strong man and he was a very moral man, and I think the last thing he wanted - because I think we both knew what was coming - was to upset me even further.I learned - I think it must have been in July of the year after he'd died, from the Independent on Sunday - that no further action would be taken.  I then got my lawyers to write to the police saying: ""Was this story true?"" Because they hadn't bothered to inform me. And I suppose about a month later I got a reply: ""Um, we wouldn't have continued it, not enough evidence, um, sorry we've caused you distress.""I only found that out, really, because of the press stories.  I'm never entirely sure when the case was dropped and certainly Leon was never told.I felt let down. I think he should have known that he was innocent of the charges before he died, but that didn't happen.It's become clear that Det Ch Insp Settle's original decision [that there was no case to answer] was correct. It's made me very saddened because I realise that the last year that Leon was alive would have been very different [if the case had been dropped].This is an edited version of Lady Brittan's interview with BBC Radio 4's The Briefing Room, to be broadcast on 24 November at 20:00 GMT. You can listen again on iPlayer following the broadcastIt would have been an easier time for me and him, looking after him, having him home away from hospital and in the final few months. [I was] very much aware of the bravery of Det Ch Insp Settle over appearing in front of the Select Committee for Home Affairs. Somebody gave me his address and I wrote him a very short note, two paragraphs only, saying: ""Thank you for what you've done and what you said gave me comfort.""It seemed to me during the course of this particular inquiry that Leon was worse treated than had he been an ordinary citizen and that, I felt, was wrong. The presumption of innocence had been set aside.I think the jury is out as to whether lessons will be learned from the whole of this affair and Operation Midland. I suppose the question that has to be asked of the [Met Police's] Commissioner is, what will change as a result of both these reports?I met the Commissioner in February. At that time he gave me an apology for the delay in telling me about the outcome of the earlier case and I presented some questions that I wanted answering both on that and then on Operation Midland.  I just wish that none of it had happened.I was a magistrate in the City of London for many years. I understand the role of the police, the rule of law.I suppose it has dented my confidence only in the officers who were involved in these operations. I don't think I could possibly extend that to the entire police force everywhere. But I do hope that lessons are learned and that the reputation of the police which I think has been damaged is restored in some way.What I'd really like is that what happened to me and Leon, to Lord Bramall, to Harvey Proctor and to others never happens to anyone else. My fervent hope is that the Met will learn lessons - and other police forces, too - from what has happened and not allow it to happen again in this way.I've been absolutely steadfast all the way through saying that I knew [the allegations] weren't true.When you're in the eye of a storm quite as turbulent as this storm, it's very hard to keep your poise - and your belief. And what I was much assisted by during all of this was my two daughters. They would always say to me, at the end of every conversation: ""Mum, it's not true, just remember that, it's not true.""And it wasn't true.Det Ch Insp Paul Settle lead an earlier investigation into the claim of rape against Lord Brittan.The first thing I did was examine the allegation that had been given to us.On [the complainants'] account alone I didn't believe the offence of rape had been made out, in that what she said had happened didn't amount to a rape.I sought the opinion of the senior Crown prosecutor for London that deals with sexual offenders, and I sent a complete anonymised information pack to her with all the relevant details in. And she came back with the same opinion - that she wasn't satisfied that the offence of rape had been committed.[As far as] I was concerned the matter was concluded with no further action.[The following year] I was informed that it was being looked at by the Commander.They didn't they didn't tell me why at the time, but it then transpired that a letter had been sent in by the Labour MP Tom Watson. The simple fact of the matter was that the offence wasn't made out and that's a very crucial part within law - that if the offence is not made out, it's stopped there and then.There was clearly going to be an awful lot of interest and an awful lot of publicity.I was told to have nothing to do with the enquiry whatsoever and I was basically going into work and staring at the wall for 18 hours. I repeatedly asked to be given something to do and was told there was nothing for me to do. I carried on going into work for a couple of weeks until, quite frankly, I couldn't take any more of it and I took two weeks' holiday. Unfortunately, the two weeks' holiday didn't do anything to help and then after that I went sick.I was asked to give evidence before the [Home Affairs Select Committee] and initially the Metropolitan Police said it was inappropriate for me to give evidence because of my junior status. When that didn't fly, they then phoned me up and asked me if they could use my medical condition as an excuse for me not to give evidence, saying I was unfit to give evidence, which I declined and said no, I'm perfectly fit, thank you.There's a certain amount of personal comfort that comes from being vindicated, but at the same time [I feel] more sorrow because it didn't have to be like this.""The Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has personally and unreservedly apologised to Lady Brittan, and offered a further personal meeting should she wish.""Since the publication of sections of the review by Sir Richard Henriques, Assistant Commissioner Helen King has written to Det Ch Insp Paul Settle offering the opportunity to meet in person.""The MPS continues to provide its fullest possible support to Det Ch Insp Settle, and we continue to want the best for his career within the organisation.""Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter."

At the same time, this was an attempt to recognise the potential economic turbulence Brexit could bring without invoking the ire of backbench Eurosceptics with an overly negative outlook. Mr Hammond was careful to speak of opportunities as well as challenges, describing a ""great nation"", resilient and strong.By his own admission there was no grand ""rabbit in the hat"". Mr Hammond wasn't out to steal the show, but rather prove he can be the steady hand on the tiller in choppy economic waters.But for Labour, this was an opportunity to seize on a chink in the government's economic armour, with the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying the much-hailed long term economic plan had been an ""abject failure""."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The tyranny of the majority? What's the tyranny?""Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP and leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, also dismissed Sir John's talk of a second referendum.""The idea this particular genie can be put back in the bottle after the British people have voted in a year-long debate - that we are now going to vote to stay in the EU - is absolute rubbish,"" he said.Mr Jenkin argued that the UK could have avoided Brexit if Sir John had held a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which was responsible for the creation of the European Union almost 25 years ago.""If he had stopped the Maastricht Treaty, there would have been no monetary union, there would have been no eurozone crisis, no bailouts, no centralisation of power in the EU - we might even still be a member of the EU,"" he told the BBC.""And it's because he gave in on the Maastricht Treaty that we've had to finish up leaving the EU.""Liberal Democrat MP Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, weighed in to add that while the government had a mandate to leave the EU, it did not have a mandate on ""how"" to leave.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, he criticised what he called the ""almost hysterical fervour of the hard Brexiteers"" to turn Britain into ""a low regulation, low tax, enlarged offshore Singapore for which they have no mandate"".He insisted it was ""quite right that people, particularly from the centre ground point of British politics, say: 'Hang on a minute, that's actually not what people necessarily voted for on 23 June'.""He added: ""Brexit yes, but not this very hard ideological Brexit that they seem determined to pursue.""

And so-called Islamic State, also known as Isil and Daesh, gained a foothold.In its report in September, the foreign affairs committee criticised David Cameron, prime minister at the time, saying he had been ultimately responsible for failing to develop a coherent Libya strategy.It said UK strategy was based on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the evidence and ministers should have foreseen that militant extremist groups would attempt to benefit from the rebellion.'Inadequate plans for stabilisation'But Conservative MP Mr Blunt said the MPs on his committee ""do not accept that it understood the implications"" of intervening in Libya - including the rise of Islamist extremism.He said its response had failed to ""work through the logic"" of the evidence heard by the committee and was ""yet to appreciate the lessons from our experience in Libya including our lack of country knowledge amongst those drafting and deciding policy"".""This is troubling, because Libya should inform the development of future UK foreign policy,"" he said, adding there should have been a ""robust process of self-examination in government to improve future performance"".""I believe we are about to repeat the failure to have adequate plans and resources for stabilisation in Mosul. Libya should have taught us these lessons.""He also urged the PM to ""reconsider"" the committee's calls for members of the National Security Council (NSC) who are not politicians - for example the chief of the defence staff - to be able to ask for written instructions from the PM when asked to do something ""contrary to their professional judgement"", rather than leaving them ""to emerge in conversations with historians"".  The government rejected that idea.In its response, the government said it did not agree with the foreign affairs committee report conclusion that no proper analysis of the rebellion or threat posed by the Gaddafi regime was carried out.Gaddafi 'unpredictable'""Real-time and evolving military, intelligence and diplomatic assessments gave ministers an understanding of the detailed context in which to take strategic decisions, as well as identifying areas where further information was needed..."" it said.""Muammar Gaddafi was unpredictable and had the means and motivation to carry out his threats. His actions could not be ignored, and required decisive and collective international action. The actions of the UK and the Coalition undoubtedly saved the lives of innocent Libyan civilians.""Former PM David Cameron told MPs in January that he had to take action in Libya because Gaddafi ""was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats"".But the foreign affairs committee's original report found that the government ""failed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated"", adding that it ""selectively took elements of Gaddafi's rhetoric at face value"".The government also failed to identify the ""militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion"", the MPs said and allowed a planned intervention to protect civilians to drift into an opportunist policy of regime change.""That policy was not underpinned by a strategy to support and shape post-Gaddafi Libya.""The result was political and economic collapse, inter-militia and inter-tribal warfare, humanitarian and migrant crises, widespread human rights violations, the spread of Gaddafi regime weapons across the region and the growth of Isil in North Africa.""February 2011 - Violent protests break out in Benghazi and spread to other cities. This leads to civil war, foreign intervention and eventually the ousting and killing of Gaddafi in August.March 2011 - UK parliament approves British participation for military intervention alongside a coalition of nations, including France and the US.2014 - Militants from so-called Islamic State claim responsibility for several attacks in Libya towards to the end of the year, as the US finds evidence that the group is setting up training camps.2016 - Following years of conflict, a new UN-backed ""unity"" government is installed in a naval base in Tripoli. It faces opposition from two rival governments and a host of militias."

The BIC was a creation of the Northern Ireland peace process, and was established as part of the Good Friday Agreement.Much of the discussion at the press conference on Friday was dominated by Irish issues, such as whether there would be a 'hard border' in Ireland after the UK leaves the European Union.Asked why the prime minister was not there, Brexit Minister Robin Walker said: ""I think this is a forum in which traditionally territorial departments have often taken the lead.""He said Mrs May had met personally the leaders of the devolved administrations and the Irish prime minister.On the balance between single market access and border controls, Mr Brokenshire, the UK government's Northern Ireland Secretary, said: ""We don't see it as a binary choice. ""We do see different options - we're considering those options carefully as we look to the triggering of Article 50 [the formal process of leaving the EU] and establishing that UK-wide stance.""Mr Brokenshire said the aim was to get ""the best possible deal, the best possible arrangements for all parts of the United Kingdom"".Analysis by BBC Wales political editor Nick ServiniArguably, these talks are more important for Carwyn Jones than anyone else. All parties want to put pressure on the UK government.But Nicola Sturgeon has constitutional leverage with the threat of independence in Scotland and Arlene Foster has the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to concentrate minds.Wales doesn't have these focal points, hence we have seen Carwyn Jones use trade as his Brexit theme that he returns to time and again.More from NickEarlier, Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales that the devolved administrations were not ""puppets"" who would accept whatever terms the UK government negotiated for leaving the European Union.He also warned that the prospect of US trade barriers under Donald Trump made full access to the EU single market after Brexit even more important.Mr Jones said the president-elect had ""made no secret of his overriding priority to get the best deal for America"".""I am totally unconvinced we will see a free trade deal that will do anything other than benefit the US,"" the first minister said. ""Indeed, access to the US market may become more, not less, difficult.""It is therefore even more important to secure the quality of our access to the European market of 500 million people.""Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called on Mr Jones to offer ""a more positive vision for life outside the EU"", saying: ""His handwringing is now creeping into overkill."""

As the party's first conference opened in Manchester she told the BBC the president-elect's win was ""sad"" but meant they could ""stop discussing whether sexism actually exists"".The party has six key objectives including equal pay, parenting, education and representation. Its conference takes place all weekend.About 1,500 of its 65,000 members and registered supporters are expected to attend speeches and debates.Asked for her reaction to Mr Trump beating Hillary Clinton to the White House, Ms Walker said: ""It was a vote to say misogyny doesn't matter, racism doesn't matter, sexism doesn't matter.""She said Mr Trump claimed to be anti-establishment but ""is about as establishment as it gets"".""The idea that this person who lives in a gold-plated penthouse is representing the masses is ludicrous,"" she added. The Women's Equality Party was founded in 2015 by author and journalist Catherine Mayer and broadcaster and author Sandi Toksvig. It wants:In the London Mayoral election in May, the party polled a quarter of a million first or second preference votes and pushed for policies such as a gender pay audit at City Hall.Asked why her party was needed when the UK has a female prime minister and Scotland has a woman first minister, Ms Walker said her party was pushing for the needs women identified through campaigns like the What Women Want initiative.""We have been hearing loud and clear from thousands of women who are still asking for equal pay, still asking for affordable childcare, still asking for fair pensions, why none of these things appear to be important enough for mainstream Westminster politics,"" she said. ""Thousands of women say 'I did this survey 20 years ago'. They are still asking for those things and are really angry that they are still asking for those things.""She said an Autumn Statement that invested in infrastructure spending, largely ""men's jobs"", meant it was ""more important than ever"" to get women into the construction industry. And she wanted to ""bust this myth that a quota system (for leading jobs in industry and business) means bringing in random people"".""You've got to be able to find all the brilliant women who are capable of doing these very demanding and important jobs, who never get the option,"" she said.

We in the Labour peers group are very sad and will miss him dearly.""Lord Taylor was admitted to hospital following the incident with a van last Wednesday.

It was the first time in 350 years that a peer had been banned in this way.He and three other peers were caught speaking to undercover journalists posing as lobbyists and appeared willing to amend a bill in return for cash."
2016-11-25,Economic watchdog defends forecasts,https://web.archive.org//web/20161126081835/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38107135,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe head of Britain's economic watchdog has defended its forecasts warning of the cost to Britain of leaving the EU.The Office for Budget Responsibility infuriated pro-Brexit Tories with its prediction that withdrawal would wipe 2.4% off growth over the next five years while adding £60bn to borrowing.Robert Chote said OBR forecasts were ""more optimistic"" than others.The OBR had to produce forecasts based on stated government policy, he said.He made the comments after Conservative former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith and backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said leaving the EU would lead to a more liberal trade regime delivering a boost to the UK economy.Mr Chote said the OBR's job was not to predict what it thought was the most likely outcome for the future, ""but what the most likely outcome is conditional upon the current stated policy of the government"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""Obviously, the outlook for policy as regards Brexit is not as clearly set out,"" he said.""We don't know what exactly the government is going to be aiming for and what could be delivered in the negotiations on things like the trade regime, migration.""We asked them whether they wanted to tell us any more about their policy in all of these areas than is already in the public domain - and they said 'no'.""Clearly it would have put us in a very difficult position if they had told us something and said we can't share that with the rest of the world.""Mr Chote said that as the likely shape of any post-Brexit settlement became clearer, it could feed into future forecasts - but he warned that was unlikely to happen quickly.""Will we end up in a world in which there are much lower tariffs both for us and for other countries? Are we going to end up with a very different-looking migration regime? That remains to be seen,"" he said.""We need the policy to clarify itself, but we also shouldn't delude ourselves that it is going to clarity itself very quickly."""

The move prompted calls for Prof Jay, who has the government's backing, to be replaced.Ben Emmerson QC, the most senior lawyer at the inquiry, resigned in September.The BBC's Newsnight programme has previously reported that the inquiry was told in September of a claim that Mr Emmerson had assaulted a woman working at its offices in a lift - a claim he has strenuously denied. The alleged victim did not want the incident investigated.In its report, the committee said it made no judgement on the claim, and suggested an external person could be appointed to examine the matter.""We are not in a position, and it is certainly not our responsibility, to assess either the facts of the case or the details of the processes that the inquiry pursued,"" the report said.""However, we do not believe that IICSA [the inquiry] has taken seriously enough its responsibility to pursue allegations of bullying or disclosures of sexual assault within the inquiry,"" it added.""Nor do we believe it has done enough to demonstrate publicly that it has a robust approach to such matters.""In a letter published by the committee alongside its report, Hugh Davies QC, a barrister who worked for the inquiry until December last year, said as a body judging how institutions dealt with this sort of allegation, it should ""expect to be judged by the same standards it will doubtless set for others"".Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the select committee, said the inquiry needed to sort out its problems fast and be less defensive about what had gone wrong.She said it was ""shameful"" that the previous chair, Dame Lowell Goddard, was refusing to give oral evidence about her sudden resignation this summer.The New Zealand high court judge previously told the committee that for her to be summoned would compromise the inquiry's ""independence and integrity"".MPs also urged the inquiry team to appoint new lawyers as soon as possible and suggested it split its workload into two strands - legal matters and child protection. Ms Cooper said: ""We found there was an unresolved tension over how far the inquiry should focus on uncovering the truth about past abuse and cover-ups and how far it should focus on current child protection policies. ""Both are important but they need different skills, experience and styles of work.""This inquiry is far too important to be sunk by problems. That's why urgent action is needed to sort them out. Survivors of abuse deserve nothing less."" In response, Prof Jay said an external senior legal figure would be invited to review some of the issues raised in the committee's report.""While I am confident that our safeguarding and dignity at work procedures are robust, I recognise the impact of recent speculation and commentary about them,"" she said.""Nobody is more determined to deliver a successful inquiry on behalf of victims, survivors and the wider public than the panel and myself.""We recognise that the past few months have been difficult for the inquiry and for the victims and survivors who have placed their trust in it.""I am personally sorry for any unnecessary anxiety the inquiry may have caused to victims and survivors during this transitional period.""She is expected to publish a review of how the inquiry operates in the coming weeks."
2016-11-25,Business leaders challenge May's pay plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20161126081835/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38100757,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May's attempt to reform corporate pay and governance faces more challenges from business leaders.A report by the Big Innovation Centre rejects holding annual binding votes on pay and the publishing of pay ratios between chief executives and workers.The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay.This week, Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans to put worker representatives on boards.The prime minister set out her intention to strengthen corporate governance when she came to power in the summer. But some proposals have drawn criticism.Friday's BIC report - whose contributors include Kingfisher non-executive director Clare Chapman - argues that action on pay is certainly needed to change executive behaviour and ""to rebuild trust"".But the report says that binding votes and pay ratios are the wrong way to do it, and would damage efforts to motivate and retain chief executives.""Pay ratios do not lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies, even within the same industry,"" the report says. ""Pay ratios may lead to pay being decoupled from performance.""And on the issue of binding votes, the report says: ""Theresa May, in a speech prior to becoming Prime Minister, indicated that there should be binding votes on executive pay. This has been interpreted by some as annual binding votes on pay outcomes, and policy proposals have been prepared by at least one Member of Parliament on this basis.""The report argues that annual binding votes would be a ""disproportionate response... and would be likely to have many negative unintended consequences"".However, it says that if a company's pay policy receives less than 75% support from shareholders in two consecutive years, that vote should be binding. Currently, votes on executive pay are held every three years.""It is less than 5% of companies that lose advisory votes,"" Ms Chapman told the BBC. ""In the past year it was about 3% and so it is not a widespread market failure that we're trying to address here, it is ensuring that shareholders have got power to take actions where there are companies that are doing things that are not in the long term interests of shareholders.""And so that's where I do think that the use of binding votes should be where advisory votes are lost,"" she added.   The BIC is backed by leading companies, academics and consultancy firms. Contributors to its research include Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, Prof Alex Edmans, a corporate governance expert at London Business School, and Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy.Given the leading names behind the report, its recommendations will be seen as a powerful contribution to the growing debate on corporate governance reforms.The recommendations include measures for ""simpler pay structures"". Instead of traditional performance-related pay and cash bonuses, the report calls for more use of share awards stretching over 5-7 years.There should also be more transparency in how pay is set and more consultation with employees to explain how and why the remuneration is set, the report says."

""No, this is really and truly our position.""He acknowledged the talks could get ""complicated"" and amount to a ""bit of a Catch 22 - it won't be a situation when one side gains and the other side loses. ""We are all going to lose something but there will not be a situation when the UK has a better deal than it has today.""Mr Muscat also reiterated the view that even when a final or interim deal is struck between EU leaders and Britain, the European Parliament may decide to veto it in 2019.But the Number 10 spokesman reiterated: ""The timetable remains to trigger Article 50 by the end of March next year.""Mr Muscat's comments come days after the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis described his meeting with the European Parliament's chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt as a ""good start"".Mr Davis said their pre-negotiations discussion had been able to cover structures and how both sides propose to approach the Brexit talks, adding a deal was possible that was in the interests of the EU and the UK. The UK government has said it does not want to reveal its negotiating hand on Brexit before the talks take place. "

It could create a new criminal offence with a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment or a £5,000 fine.Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon says he ""fully supports"" the proposal.The bill will undergo further scrutiny by MPs at committee stage at a later date. ""Medals recognise our forces who risk their lives for freedom. It is important their service is properly protected,"" he said.But James Glancy, a former captain in the Royal Marines who received the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for his service in Afghanistan, told the BBC's Daily Politics the bill goes ""too far"". ""I think it's just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison…"" he said. ""I think it's very important to look at what's going on with someone that is actually pretending that they served in the armed forces. ""There may well be a serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low self-esteem, they're not a threat to the public, and they actually need professional help."" Legislation making the unauthorised wearing of medals a criminal offence was originally introduced in the aftermath of the First World War by the then secretary for war, Winston Churchill.It remained on the statute book until 2006 when the new Armed Forces Act came into force and the provisions relating to military decorations were not carried over.Mr Johnson's bill has the backing of the Commons Defence Committee, which said in a report earlier this week that the unauthorised wearing of medals constituted ""a harm that is worthy of specific criminal prohibition"".""There is a tangible and identifiable harm created by military imposters against members of society who should rightly be held in its highest esteem,"" it said.Speaking at the bill's second reading in the Commons, Mr Johnson said: ""To undermine our veterans is wrong. To claim you're a military hero when you are not is wrong, and to steal valour is wrong.""The point of this bill is to protect genuine heroes. People should not be able to claim that they are heroes when they are not.Showing MPs his great-grandfather's military medal, he said the new legislation would not stop family members from wearing medals their relatives had earned.And he said the bill would be sensitive to those with mental health issues.  ""What I want to do is to make sure we catch only those who intend deliberately to deceive others,"" he told MPs.Retired Major Judith Webb was the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the British Army. She said changing the law would help to take action out of the hands of vigilantism, and into the hands of police. ""Such imposters - and there do seem to be quite a few of them - should be prosecuted,"" she said. But Col Lincoln Jopp, who commanded the 1st Battalion Scots guards in Afghanistan and was awarded the Military Cross for service in Sierra Leone, said it was a ""mistaken priority"" in tackling challenges faced by veterans.

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

What drives these ""Walter Mittys"" to invent fake tales of heroism?Maybe it starts down the pub. There's talk of the SAS, and you've read all the books. An exaggeration becomes an embellishment, and then a lie.People are impressed. You get carried away. Buy medals on eBay. Wear them to a Remembrance Day parade. Then you slip up. You get a detail wrong and someone notices. You're exposed as a fraud. A Walter Mitty.In military circles, the name of James Thurber's fictional fantasist is applied to the persistent band of hoaxers who, for whatever reason, boast of military records they haven't earned. Sometimes Walter Mitty is abbreviated to Walter, or just Walt.One well-publicised case involved Roger Day, who admitted he hadn't earned the 17 medals - including awards for serving in World War II, the Military Medal and SAS badges - that he wore at a 2009 parade in Warwickshire.In 2008, bus driver Jamie Barrett was spotted marching in Edinburgh with members of the Parachute Regiment who had served in the Falklands. He had bought his medals online. After he was exposed, Barrett said:  ""I'm basically a Walter Mitty type of person.""And last year, Oxford's town crier Anthony Church confessed to inventing a career in the armed forces. He had previously claimed he was a ""regimental sergeant major"" and had worn a Falklands medal.Most people would regard the concoction of fake tales of heroism as reprehensible.""It completely undermines genuine heroes,"" says Gareth Johnson, the MP for Dartford who introduced the proposed law - the Awards for Valour (Protection) Bill - that would make wearing unauthorised medals a criminal offence, punishable by prison or a £5,000 fine.""People who have served their country in genuinely dangerous environments, then someone comes along and pretends that they are their equal - that causes a lot of offence,"" he says. ""When people see veterans it's important that people have confidence their medals are legitimate.""Internet vigilante groups with names like the Walter Mitty Hunters Club are dedicated to uncovering and shaming them, and these exposes are regularly picked up and given extra publicity by an indignant tabloid press.But what actually motivates the Walter Mittys to concoct their often elaborate tales is not always obvious.In Day's case, a court was told he had started to make up stories to impress his new wife, who was 24 years his junior.Confronted after his exposure, Barrett's explanation for his behaviour was more prosaic: ""I had been collecting the medals and silliness got hold of me. I got a bit carried away, put the medals on and went. I didn't realise that it would upset other people.""One of the more spectacular cases of recent times involved Capt Sir Alan McIlwraith, CBE, DSO, MC, MiD - or, rather, plain Alan McIlwraith, a call-centre worker living on a Glasgow council estate who built up an elaborate fake persona as a highly decorated officer who had finished top of his class at Sandhurst and served in the Balkans.""The lie had just gone too deep, it's like a weed that invades your life. Once it's taken root, there's nothing you can do about it,"" McIlwraith, who was exposed as a fraud in 2006, told the Guardian. Some will have had no involvement with the armed forces whatsoever, Greenberg says. But others might embellish their own military service into something more impressive-sounding. Richard Lee claimed he had served with the Royal Marines' mountain troops when he set up the worldwide endurance competition, Spartan Race. In fact, it turned out he had enrolled in the Officer Training Corps but dropped out before qualifying.Just how many Walter Mittys there are isn't entirely clear.In evidence to the Commons Defence Committee, the Royal British Legion (RBL) said it in its experience ""instances of so-called 'Walter Mittys' appear to be rare"" while the The Royal Air Force Families Federation said the issue was ""not widespread"".However, 64% of 1,111 Naval Families Federation members surveyed over four days said they had personally encountered individuals wearing medals or insignia that had been awarded to someone else. Gareth Johnson says his own RBL branch has had to expel two members who concocted bogus military records.Neil Greenberg, professor of defence mental health at King's College London, also argues that the phenomenon is more widespread than you might expect.""I've seen more people who say they were at the Iranian embassy siege than were actually at the Iranian embassy siege,"" he says. Gareth Johnson says the UK is highly unusual in not already having legislation of the kind he proposes. The wearing of medals without authorisation was made illegal by Winston Churchill after World War One - but in 2006, when the new Armed Forces Act came into effect, this was effectively repealed. So although Roger Day pleaded guilty to falsely wearing medals in 2010, a community order imposed on him was scrapped after his lawyer noticed that this had stopped being an offence 11 days before the parade.Under the Fraud Act, anyone who uses medals for financial gain can be prosecuted - but if no such benefit can be proved, no offence has been committed. One man who did gain financially is Christopher Griffin, a bodyguard who falsely claimed to have been a British Army Captain for 11 years, who admitted two counts of fraud by false representation at Plymouth Magistrates Court last year.Neil Greenberg, who has assessed several military impostors, isn't convinced that stricter legislation will deter them.""It's often not fully conscious,"" he says.  They are typically fairly pathetic individuals, as he puts it, who are ""doing it to bolster their own self-esteem"". ""Their problems are greater than that they say they were in the SAS,"" he says. Many will have an ""abnormal or end-of-normal personality"", while a few will have serious mental health problems.Critics have warned that the bill before Parliament would end up targeting people who were mentally ill. Johnson says it would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether it was in the public interest to prosecute any individual accused of wearing medals they hadn't earned. He also says that people who wear medals won by relatives, to honour their memory, would not face prosecution.Johnson's proposed law has won the backing of ministers. ""I fully support this bill,"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says. ""Medals recognise our forces who risk their lives for our freedom. It's important their service is properly protected.""The Commons Defence Committee also backs the legislation. In its report on the proposed law, it concluded there is ""a tangible and identifiable harm created by military impostors"". Its chairman, Julian Lewis, said such ""contemptible fantasists"" need to be deterred.Even without the threat of prosecution, being unmasked as a Walter Mitty in the media or online can be devastating in its own right. The BBC contacted a number of men who had been unmasked as impostors. None was prepared to speak on the record, but several spoke of their deep shame and said they had contemplated suicide.Many will have no sympathy. But Greenberg says everyone should examine their own capacity for Walt-like behaviour.""Most people exaggerate,"" he says. ""There's an element of this in all of us.""

2016-11-25,Steering UK out of the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20161126081835/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38089711,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNegotiations over leaving the EU are set to begin next year. Might one leading European official's love of many things British help things go a little more smoothly?One key to a Brexit deal could be a vintage Aston Martin. That, I have discovered, is what petrolhead Belgian MEP and EU Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt drives. An amateur rally enthusiast, Mr Verhofstadt shared some of his passion for cars with the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, during a meeting in Strasbourg this week. Mr Davis emerged beaming from the talks saying Mr Verhofstadt was great fun, saying: ""He's a very nice man. He races British cars and we got on very well."" A quote that suggests these early stages of non-negotiation could not be going better. He likes British cars! Mr Verhofstadt leads the liberal group in the European Parliament and will represent MEPs in the forthcoming negotiations with the UK. If you think of Nigel Farage at one end of the EU spectrum, Guy Verhofstadt is at the other. A passionate believer in the EU project, the former Belgian prime minister enjoys tormenting Eurosceptics as much as he enjoys tearing round a race track. His voice will matter as the UK tries to cut a divorce deal with the EU. So the fact that he, of all people, enjoys spending time with an oily rag and Aston Martin suggests an emotional tie to Britain that could colour his view of Brexit. And what about all the other EU negotiators and leaders? Holidays in Devon, a love of Adele, a taste for Marmite. All this might matter as the UK and the EU knuckle down to business. A process that government ministers like to say will be fairly straightforward. Theresa May talks about it being a ""smooth process"". Mr Davis has said he is confident a deal can be struck in the mutual interests of the UK and the rest of the EU. But if the UK thinks there can be a form of Gwyneth Paltrow-style ""conscious uncoupling"" with the EU that avoids the acrimonious misery of most divorces, I think they're wrong. No amount of affection for all things British is going to soften the EU's determination to make Brexit hard on the departing member state. A hint of this was in the curt and flinty comments by various MEPs after Mr Davis had gone.Mr Verhofstadt said the negotiations would be ""intense"" and there could be no compromise on the four freedoms underpinning the EU. The leader of the centre-right group of MEPs, Manfred Weber, was brusque, saying there could be no cherry-picking and no special deal between the UK and the EU.Speaking to officials and politicians off-the-record in Brussels last week, I did not hear much talk about a straightforward deal cut for mutual benefit. Instead, the aim is to find an exit for Britain that makes it clear to remaining EU states they are better off in the club than out of it. Of course, the EU does a lot of trade with the UK and member states do not want to jeopardise that. But I was also told by officials within the EU institutions that Brexit is an existential threat to the EU that has to be dealt with firmly. That might mean a divorce deal with the UK that puts politics ahead of economics. Which is exactly what many in Brussels think Theresa May's government has done by heavily hinting the UK wants to leave the single market but have access to it.As the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has already said, he thinks the choice for Britain will either be a hard Brexit or no Brexit. For the EU it is Mr Tusk who will lead the remaining 27 member states through the talks with UK. The nitty-gritty of negotiations will be done by the European Commission and a unit headed by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. But it is EU states who will have the final say on that side of the table.The mantra in Brussels is ""no negotiation without notification"". That means no talks with the UK until Theresa May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - a move she wants to make by the end of March 2017. There is impatience in the EU for the prime minister to get on with it. As Whitehall tries to work out what it wants from Brexit, a parallel process is under way in Brussels and there is a sense of mobilisation. Bilateral meetings are happening now between the EU Council and the remaining 27 member states on how the negotiations should work. This work is being led by Didier Seeuws, who runs the European Council's Brexit taskforce. These talks are not about the substance of the negotiation or red lines but about how the EU heads of government will feed into the Commission's work during Article 50 negotiations.Brexit is also expected be discussed among the 27 (without the UK) on the margins of the December European Council. Soon after Article 50 has been triggered, the EU Council of 27 will meet to agree the negotiation guidelines and discuss their starting position for talks. In Westminster it is often assumed the UK is in the driving seat for negotiations. That is not so. In the European Council's view, Article 50 is there to protect the interests of the remaining 27 EU members. I do not think there is a punitive mood towards Britain but there is a widespread expectation negotiations will be tougher and more complex than the UK realises.As one Commission official told me, unlike David Cameron's renegotiation, the UK will not have any ""friends"" in these talks. Each country will try to use Brexit to their press own advantage. France, in particular, sees a great opportunity for growing its own financial services sector after years of feeling thwarted by the UK. And with the various legal services of the EU institutions to use, the expertise of EU trade negotiators and the European Commission to draw upon, I was not discouraged from thinking the UK might be rather outgunned. One official told me the EU had a howitzer compared to the UK's peashooter.There has been a lot of speculation about whether Mrs May will seek a transitional deal with the EU; an arrangement that bridges the time between the UK leaving the EU and beginning a new trade relationship. It may not be her choice.Crucially, the European Council sees the Article 50 negotiations as limited to the divorce deal. In its view, talks about the future trade and security relationship between the UK and EU can only start after the UK has left, so parallel talks on a transitional arrangement are expected. It could all get very messy.If negotiations prove tough and more time is needed beyond the two-year Article 50 window, only the remaining 27 member states can agree to extend talks by unanimous agreement. Some senior officials in Brussels believe it is quite possible no agreement can be found and that either the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal reached or the government decides to pull the brake on the whole process. The European Council does not have a legal opinion on whether that is even possible and clearly in Britain that scenario is as politically far-fetched as it gets.But in contrast to the post-referendum phoney war that still prevails, Brexit will soon pit Westminster against a belligerent Brussels. A European fondness for classic British cars will count for very little."
2016-11-25,Phones out of order?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161126081835/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38093758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEyebrows have been raised by pictures showing several MPs using their smartphones during Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell's Autumn Statement speech. But is this unparliamentary - or even bad manners - these days?It was John McDonnell's big day. The shadow chancellor stood at the House of Commons despatch box at 13.20 GMT to coruscate Philip Hammond over his Autumn Statement.Labour MPs were rapt as he did so. Some by his oratory; others, it seems, by the electronic devices in their hands. As the picture above shows, quite a few MPs, even some of his front bench colleagues, used their smartphones while he spoke.As the next picture shows, the activity was not confined to one side, Business Secretary Greg Clark looking at his while Mr Hammond answered questions.And even Mr McDonnell himself was distracted at one point by a mobile phone held by his shadow Treasury team colleague Jonathan Reynolds. Speaker John Bercow has previously warned MPs not to ""fiddle"" with their phones ""ostentatiously"" and suggested they go outside if they really can't resist the temptation.But is it right that this has to be spelt out in one of the world's premier debating chambers, where argument is supposed to be of paramount importance? Where Gladstone and Disraeli were supreme, where Churchill guided a nation through its most challenging times?Well, since 2007, Commons rules have stated that MPs can use mobiles ""to keep up to date with emails... provided that it causes no disturbance"".It sounds like a quaint provision today. Times have changed, as the Commons Procedure Committee notes: ""There are many new devices, including portable 'tablet' computers such as iPads or smartphones, which were not known to the Modernisation Committee which drew up the report which led to the House's resolution.""There are also new uses of technology, for example Twitter, which were similarly unknown but on which the Speaker and the Chair of any committee may be expected to rule, using the existing resolution as a guideline.""Conservative MP Nigel Mills issued an apology in 2014 for playing the mobile puzzle game Candy Crush Saga during a Commons committee hearing.Generally, though, tweeting from inside the chamber is seen as acceptable.Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told BBC 5 live: ""The world moves on. But it's not about being obvious, is it? It's about ensuring that you be discreet.""If he thought an MP was tapping away and staring downwards a little too noticeably, he would give them ""a nudge"", rather than shout across the chamber, he said.Mr Hoyle added: ""People want to stay in touch with the outside world now. They want to tell them what's going on. It's about keeping the balance right....""Everything moves on, as we know, in this world. When people talk to each other through a device without even speaking, you've got to wonder where does society end up. I hope we don't lose the ability to talk to each other.""Mr Hoyle also acknowledged that the guilty verdict following the trial of Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox had come through about an hour before Mr McDonnell began speaking, meaning there was more focus on news sites and social media than usual.But the rules are stronger in some other countries, irrespective of circumstance. In Greece, electronic devices are banned from the plenary hall, while the Finnish chamber prohibits the use of laptops.In the US, Congress has a rule stating: ""A person on the floor of the House may not smoke or use a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.""Mr McDonnell, when asked about the Autumn Statement scenes, told Sky News: ""What they do now in the Commons, and I'm not sure how this goes down with the general public, is that a lot of them will be tweeting their comments out about what's being said and they'll be responding to tweets etc.""It's changed the nature of the chamber itself... It's happening consistently now and you see it on all political parties too,""If answering emails is distracting, social media is more so.The Commons authorities recognise this: ""As an example of a practice which could not have been predicted by the Modernisation Committee in 2007, tweeting could hardly be bettered.""The procedure committee says it would be ""inconsistent"" to allow tweeting from the gallery overlooking the Commons but ban it from inside the chamber.But it urges MPs to ""use their good sense and behave with courtesy, particularly in not tweeting messages which would be disorderly if said in the House"".At least they are showing themselves to be in touch with normal life.Be thankful that none of them were gurning, thumbs up with arms around one another - selfies are a huge no-no, photography within the Palace of Westminster requiring prior permission."

2016-11-25,Belt tightening,https://web.archive.org//web/20161126081835/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38089190,"The size of the challenge facing a chancellor who has pledged an economy ""that works for everyone"" is becoming increasingly clear.And it is not just down to Brexit.After an Autumn Statement which abandoned pledges to hit a government budget surplus by 2020, new analysis claims the squeeze on living standards could be worse during this Parliament than between 2010 and 2015.The report by the Resolution Foundation says lower earnings and higher inflation could mean incomes growing less than half as fast between 2015 and 2020 compared to the years following the financial crisis and the recession that followed.It also says that the ""jobs miracle"" which saw unemployment fall below 5% ""would not be repeated"".The figures reveal the difficult position the government could find itself in by the next election after its pledge to support those who feel themselves to be ""just about managing"".The Resolution Foundation study said the freeze on benefits and rising inflation could mean the bottom third of earners seeing their incomes fall.The findings of the study are echoed in the Treasury's own ""distributional analysis"" which looks at the impact of tax, welfare and public spending pledges contained in the Autumn Statement.Those charts say that the bottom 30% of earners are likely to be worse off.Only the top 10% of earners will see as significant a hit, with middle income families slightly better off by 2020.The Resolution Foundation report, to be released later this morning and seen by the BBC, says: ""The weak outlook for real average earnings, which the OBR [the Office for Budget Responsibility] forecasts to be £830 lower in 2020 than previously expected, means that the decade from 2010 to 2020 is set to be the weakest one for wage growth since the 1900s.""Real weekly earnings are forecast to grow by just 1.6% over the decade, compared to 12.7% in the 2000s and over 20% in every other decade since the 1920s.""Sources close to Mr Hammond have told me the chancellor is well aware of the difficult economic situation he faces and say that is why he has made increases in UK productivity his priority.If through investment in skills and infrastructure he can create the conditions to allow the economy to perform better, then the OBR's forecasts may prove too gloomy.Interestingly, the chancellor relaxed the government's spending rules not to reverse the benefits freeze or cut taxes, but to invest in infrastructure (such as new roads) and ""innovation"", in short research and development skills.Economic models suggest there is a direct relationship between infrastructure spending, skills investment and better economic growth and therefore wage increases.Weak productivity growth was a major problem for the UK economy well before the vote to leave the European Union.But, although the government announced increased spending yesterday, if private sector investment falls due to the uncertainty following the Brexit decision, then that could more than wipe out all of the fresh money being offered by the government."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

2016-11-26,Politicians urged not to 'legitimise hate',https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38120596,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkWestminster party leaders should tone down campaigning that has ""polarised"" the country and ""legitimised hate"", the equalities watchdog has said.In a letter to all party leaders, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) expresses concern about hate attacks that have taken place since the UK voted to leave the EU in June. It calls for ""accurate information and respectful debate"" from politicians.The Home Office said extra money had been allocated to tackle hate crime.The commission's letter, which is co-signed by its chairman David Isaac and chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath, said politicians had spoken about ""the need to heal the country and bring people together"" following the UK's EU referendum.But instead, it said ""there is growing concern that the divisions on a range of big questions are widening and exacerbating tensions in our society"".It pointed to the killing of Arkadiusz Jozwick, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks on the streets, and reports of hijabs being pulled off, all of which it described as ""stains on our society"".The letter comes after Thomas Mair was jailed for life on Wednesday for the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox during the referendum campaign. Prosecutors said the attack was ""nothing less than acts of terrorism"" and the judge said it was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism. EHRC chair Mr Isaac emphasised it was about protecting all people and that human rights were ""not just for the minority.""""We do need to ensure we come up with the right solutions for Britain when we leave the European Union... we know there are people who feel disenfranchised,"" he told BBC Breakfast.Mr Isaac said the media had a role to play but sometimes coverage was ""unsympathetic and actually misleading"".The commission, an independent statutory body which advises on equality and human rights law, said: ""We are concerned that attacks on supporters of both sides of the Brexit debate have polarised many parts of the country. ""There are those who used, and continue to use, public concern about immigration policy and the economy to legitimise hate. ""The vast majority of people who voted to leave the European Union did so because they believe it is best for Britain and not because they are intolerant of others.""It describes the Brexit vote as a ""defining moment"" for the country, saying that while the focus has been on the economic and trading implications there should also be a ""discussion on what values we hold as a country"".The letter also criticises the government's aborted plan to demand companies set out the proportion of foreigners they employ, which was announced by Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Conservative Party conference in October. It said ""politicians of all sides should be aware of the effect on national mood of their words and policies, even when they are not enacted"". The letter also mentioned the discussion around child migrants, ""where dialogue escalated to irrational levels"". And it said there had been an ""ambivalent reception"" to claims of anti-Semitism in politics, an issue that BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said had dogged the Labour Party in particular. The commission said it welcomed the government's hate crime plans, but said more concerted action was needed.It suggested there should be a review of the sentences for hate crimes in England and Wales. Home Office figures released in October showed racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41% in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU.The Home Office said there was ""absolutely no excuse"" for such offences and extra money had been allocated to tackle the issue."
2016-11-26,Firms could be made to reveal CEO pay gap,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38120604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkBritain's largest companies will have to reveal the pay gap between their CEOs and average workers, under new government proposals.It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages.It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards.The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment.Its proposals will include:As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role.Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives.In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to £3.4m.As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia.A government source said: ""Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services.""The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance.""Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business.""The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios.The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay.A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent.It also said that pay ratios do not ""lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies"" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating ""perverse incentives"".Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a ""Fair Pay Charter"" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay."
2016-11-26,Corbyn praises 'huge figure' of Castro,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38117068,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkFidel Castro, who has died aged 90, was a ""huge figure in our lives"", Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Mr Corbyn praised the former Cuban president's revolutionary ""heroism"", his presence on the world stage and Cuba's health and education systems. Mr Castro's death was announced by his younger brother Raul Castro, his successor as president of Cuba.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Fidel Castro had been a ""historic, if controversial figure"". Mr Johnson expressed the UK's condolences to the government and people of Cuba, and said Mr Castro's death marked ""the end of an era for Cuba and the start of a new one for Cuba's people"".He added: ""The UK will continue to work with the government of Cuba on a wide range of foreign policy priorities, including on human rights.""Live updatesObituary: Fidel CastroFidel Castro: A life in picturesFidel: The world iconFormer Labour London mayor Ken Livingstone called Mr Castro an ""absolute giant"" of the 20th Century.Former Labour MP George Galloway tweeted a picture of himself with Mr Castro, writing: ""You were the greatest man I ever met Comandante Fidel. You were the man of the century.""But other senior Labour figures have been more critical. Mr Corbyn, a long-time supporter of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign - which campaigns against the blockade on, and foreign intervention in, Cuba - described Mr Castro as a ""huge figure of modern history, national independence and 20th Century socialism"".He said: ""From building a world-class health and education system, to Cuba's record of international solidarity abroad, Castro's achievements were many.""For all his flaws, Castro's support for Angola played a crucial role in bringing an end to apartheid in South Africa and he will be remembered both as an internationalist and a champion of social justice.""He acknowledged ""there were problems and there are problems of excesses by all regimes"" but ""we have to look at the thing in its totality"" and Mr Castro had ""seen off a lot of US presidents"".But former Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith said the reason Mr Castro ""'saw off' so many US presidents is because they're democratically elected"".And Labour MP Mike Gapes, a former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, highlighted a Human Rights Watch report that reported ""much worse than just some 'problems and excesses' in Cuba"".In London, Latin American ambassadors, academics and activists had gathered at a conference, where they remembered Fidel Castro. The Cuban ambassador to the United Kingdom, Teresita Vicente Sotolongo, described the former president as a ""very warm person"". ""I don't think we were ever prepared to think that he's not here in person, not with us. But I am confident his legacy we will go on,"" she said.Rob Miller, from the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, met Fidel Castro as a teenager and described him as ""charming"" and ""very interested in our lives"".""Fidel embodies that David and Goliath spirit that has seen Cuba develop its own ways and its own politics, its own destiny,"" said Mr Miller.A book of condolence will be opened at the Cuban embassy in London. By chance, London is today playing host to the Latin America Conference, described as the largest event of the year for Latin American solidarity in Britain. The start of proceedings were marked with a minute's silence, followed by applause as a tribute to Fidel Castro's life. The Cuba Solidarity Campaign described him as a great man, who demonstrated that another world is possible, economically and politically. There is a real sense of sadness among delegates here, not least from the Cuban ambassador to the UK, Teresita Vicente, who looked visibly upset when talking about the two occasions on which she met Fidel Castro.    Everyone here knew he was old and has recently only rarely been seen in public, but many feel they have lost someone to look up to, an iconic figure, a David who took on the might of an American Goliath.  Ask about the criticisms of Castro, though, related to human rights and free speech, and they reply that this is a myth perpetrated by the US. Today, they want to talk about his achievements.Mr Livingstone told Radio 4's Today programme: ""Of course Fidel did things that were wrong. Initially he wasn't very good on lesbian and gay rights.""He stressed the health and education successes and even distribution of wealth under Castro, but said he believed over time Cuba would move towards ""something like a traditional west European democracy"". Former Labour cabinet minister and anti-apartheid leader Peter Hain praised Cuban troops' defeat of South Africa's troops in Angola in 1988, as a ""vital turning point in the struggle against apartheid"".But he added that Mr Castro was ""criticised, rightly, for his attacks on human rights and curbs on free speech and his attitude towards gay Cubans which were indefensible"".This criticism was echoed by Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader.Mr Farron said whilst he was undoubtedly a significant leader, ""we must not overlook the appalling human rights abuses including brutal summary executions for which he was responsible"".Paul Webster was the UK's ambassador to Cuba from 2001-2004 and is now an international relations lecturer at Boston University. He described the leader as ""a good reader of human nature"" which ""helped him consolidate power"". But he warned of uncertainty in the future. ""For many Cubans its almost impossible to conceive of a world, a Cuba, without Fidel. So change will have to be carefully managed,"" he said. "
2016-11-26,Major accused over new Brexit vote bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38109125,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEx-Prime Minister Sir John Major has been accused of ""an absolute dismissal"" of democracy after he suggested there should be a second Brexit vote.Iain Duncan Smith, Leave campaigner and another ex-Conservative leader, said: ""You can't claim democracy when you want it and reject it when you don't.""He spoke out after Sir John also warned against Brexit being dictated by the ""tyranny of the majority"".Mr Duncan Smith said: ""We had a vote, that vote now has to be acted on.""The dispute came after Sir John, Conservative prime minister between 1990 and 1997, called for the 48% of people who voted against Brexit in June's referendum to have their views considered.""The tyranny of the majority has never applied in a democracy - and it should not apply in this particular democracy,"" he said.He argued that Parliament would have to ratify whatever deal is finally reached by the Brexit negotiators and there could be a case for a second referendum, depending on the deal on offer.Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett: ""The idea we delay everything just simply because they disagree with the original result does seem to me an absolute dismissal of democracy.""And that's what I thought John Major's comments were today. The tyranny of the majority? What's the tyranny?""Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP and leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, also dismissed Sir John's talk of a second referendum.""The idea this particular genie can be put back in the bottle after the British people have voted in a year-long debate - that we are now going to vote to stay in the EU - is absolute rubbish,"" he said.Mr Jenkin argued that the UK could have avoided Brexit if Sir John had held a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which was responsible for the creation of the European Union almost 25 years ago.""If he had stopped the Maastricht Treaty, there would have been no monetary union, there would have been no eurozone crisis, no bailouts, no centralisation of power in the EU - we might even still be a member of the EU,"" he told the BBC.""And it's because he gave in on the Maastricht Treaty that we've had to finish up leaving the EU.""Liberal Democrat MP Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, weighed in to add that while the government had a mandate to leave the EU, it did not have a mandate on ""how"" to leave.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, he criticised what he called the ""almost hysterical fervour of the hard Brexiteers"" to turn Britain into ""a low regulation, low tax, enlarged offshore Singapore for which they have no mandate"".He insisted it was ""quite right that people, particularly from the centre ground point of British politics, say: 'Hang on a minute, that's actually not what people necessarily voted for on 23 June'.""He added: ""Brexit yes, but not this very hard ideological Brexit that they seem determined to pursue.""

2016-11-26,Ministers 'have not learned from Libya',https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096961,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe UK government appears not to have learned the lessons from its 2011 Libya intervention, say MPs.Chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Crispin Blunt, said ministers' response was ""troubling"", as he believed similar mistakes could be made in future.In September, the committee said the UK had lacked a coherent strategy and intelligence had not been ""accurate"".But the government disagreed, saying the coalition's actions saved lives.An international coalition led by Britain and France launched a campaign of air and missile strikes against Muammar Gaddafi's forces in March 2011 after the regime threatened to attack the rebel-held city of Benghazi.But after Gaddafi was toppled, Libya descended into violence, with rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias. And so-called Islamic State, also known as Isil and Daesh, gained a foothold.In its report in September, the foreign affairs committee criticised David Cameron, prime minister at the time, saying he had been ultimately responsible for failing to develop a coherent Libya strategy.It said UK strategy was based on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the evidence and ministers should have foreseen that militant extremist groups would attempt to benefit from the rebellion.'Inadequate plans for stabilisation'But Conservative MP Mr Blunt said the MPs on his committee ""do not accept that it understood the implications"" of intervening in Libya - including the rise of Islamist extremism.He said its response had failed to ""work through the logic"" of the evidence heard by the committee and was ""yet to appreciate the lessons from our experience in Libya including our lack of country knowledge amongst those drafting and deciding policy"".""This is troubling, because Libya should inform the development of future UK foreign policy,"" he said, adding there should have been a ""robust process of self-examination in government to improve future performance"".""I believe we are about to repeat the failure to have adequate plans and resources for stabilisation in Mosul. Libya should have taught us these lessons.""He also urged the PM to ""reconsider"" the committee's calls for members of the National Security Council (NSC) who are not politicians - for example the chief of the defence staff - to be able to ask for written instructions from the PM when asked to do something ""contrary to their professional judgement"", rather than leaving them ""to emerge in conversations with historians"".  The government rejected that idea.In its response, the government said it did not agree with the foreign affairs committee report conclusion that no proper analysis of the rebellion or threat posed by the Gaddafi regime was carried out.Gaddafi 'unpredictable'""Real-time and evolving military, intelligence and diplomatic assessments gave ministers an understanding of the detailed context in which to take strategic decisions, as well as identifying areas where further information was needed..."" it said.""Muammar Gaddafi was unpredictable and had the means and motivation to carry out his threats. His actions could not be ignored, and required decisive and collective international action. The actions of the UK and the Coalition undoubtedly saved the lives of innocent Libyan civilians.""Former PM David Cameron told MPs in January that he had to take action in Libya because Gaddafi ""was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats"".But the foreign affairs committee's original report found that the government ""failed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated"", adding that it ""selectively took elements of Gaddafi's rhetoric at face value"".The government also failed to identify the ""militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion"", the MPs said and allowed a planned intervention to protect civilians to drift into an opportunist policy of regime change.""That policy was not underpinned by a strategy to support and shape post-Gaddafi Libya.""The result was political and economic collapse, inter-militia and inter-tribal warfare, humanitarian and migrant crises, widespread human rights violations, the spread of Gaddafi regime weapons across the region and the growth of Isil in North Africa.""February 2011 - Violent protests break out in Benghazi and spread to other cities. This leads to civil war, foreign intervention and eventually the ousting and killing of Gaddafi in August.March 2011 - UK parliament approves British participation for military intervention alongside a coalition of nations, including France and the US.2014 - Militants from so-called Islamic State claim responsibility for several attacks in Libya towards to the end of the year, as the US finds evidence that the group is setting up training camps.2016 - Following years of conflict, a new UN-backed ""unity"" government is installed in a naval base in Tripoli. It faces opposition from two rival governments and a host of militias."

The BIC was a creation of the Northern Ireland peace process, and was established as part of the Good Friday Agreement.Much of the discussion at the press conference on Friday was dominated by Irish issues, such as whether there would be a 'hard border' in Ireland after the UK leaves the European Union.Asked why the prime minister was not there, Brexit Minister Robin Walker said: ""I think this is a forum in which traditionally territorial departments have often taken the lead.""He said Mrs May had met personally the leaders of the devolved administrations and the Irish prime minister.On the balance between single market access and border controls, Mr Brokenshire, the UK government's Northern Ireland Secretary, said: ""We don't see it as a binary choice. ""We do see different options - we're considering those options carefully as we look to the triggering of Article 50 [the formal process of leaving the EU] and establishing that UK-wide stance.""Mr Brokenshire said the aim was to get ""the best possible deal, the best possible arrangements for all parts of the United Kingdom"".Analysis by BBC Wales political editor Nick ServiniArguably, these talks are more important for Carwyn Jones than anyone else. All parties want to put pressure on the UK government.But Nicola Sturgeon has constitutional leverage with the threat of independence in Scotland and Arlene Foster has the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to concentrate minds.Wales doesn't have these focal points, hence we have seen Carwyn Jones use trade as his Brexit theme that he returns to time and again.More from NickEarlier, Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales that the devolved administrations were not ""puppets"" who would accept whatever terms the UK government negotiated for leaving the European Union.He also warned that the prospect of US trade barriers under Donald Trump made full access to the EU single market after Brexit even more important.Mr Jones said the president-elect had ""made no secret of his overriding priority to get the best deal for America"".""I am totally unconvinced we will see a free trade deal that will do anything other than benefit the US,"" the first minister said. ""Indeed, access to the US market may become more, not less, difficult.""It is therefore even more important to secure the quality of our access to the European market of 500 million people.""Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called on Mr Jones to offer ""a more positive vision for life outside the EU"", saying: ""His handwringing is now creeping into overkill."""

As the party's first conference opened in Manchester she told the BBC the president-elect's win was ""sad"" but meant they could ""stop discussing whether sexism actually exists"".The party has six key objectives including equal pay, parenting, education and representation. Its conference takes place all weekend.About 1,500 of its 65,000 members and registered supporters are expected to attend speeches and debates.Asked for her reaction to Mr Trump beating Hillary Clinton to the White House, Ms Walker said: ""It was a vote to say misogyny doesn't matter, racism doesn't matter, sexism doesn't matter.""She said Mr Trump claimed to be anti-establishment but ""is about as establishment as it gets"".""The idea that this person who lives in a gold-plated penthouse is representing the masses is ludicrous,"" she added. The Women's Equality Party was founded in 2015 by author and journalist Catherine Mayer and broadcaster and author Sandi Toksvig. It wants:In the London Mayoral election in May, the party polled a quarter of a million first or second preference votes and pushed for policies such as a gender pay audit at City Hall.Asked why her party was needed when the UK has a female prime minister and Scotland has a woman first minister, Ms Walker said her party was pushing for the needs women identified through campaigns like the What Women Want initiative.""We have been hearing loud and clear from thousands of women who are still asking for equal pay, still asking for affordable childcare, still asking for fair pensions, why none of these things appear to be important enough for mainstream Westminster politics,"" she said.

We in the Labour peers group are very sad and will miss him dearly.""Lord Taylor was admitted to hospital following the incident with a van last Wednesday. His injuries were initially not thought to be life-threatening.The driver stopped at the scene but was not arrested, police said at the time.For more on this story and others in LondonThomas Taylor became a member of Blackburn Town Council in 1954 and was its leader from 1972-76.In 2009 Lord Taylor was suspended from the Lords for six months after allegedly offering to help a business secure favourable changes in legislation for a fee in a newspaper sting operation.  It was the first time in 350 years that a peer had been banned in this way.He and three other peers were caught speaking to undercover journalists posing as lobbyists and appeared willing to amend a bill in return for cash."
2016-11-26,Economic watchdog defends forecasts,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38107135,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe head of Britain's economic watchdog has defended its forecasts warning of the cost to Britain of leaving the EU.The Office for Budget Responsibility infuriated pro-Brexit Tories with its prediction that withdrawal would wipe 2.4% off growth over the next five years while adding £60bn to borrowing.Robert Chote said OBR forecasts were ""more optimistic"" than others.The OBR had to produce forecasts based on stated government policy, he said.He made the comments after Conservative former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith and backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said leaving the EU would lead to a more liberal trade regime delivering a boost to the UK economy.Mr Chote said the OBR's job was not to predict what it thought was the most likely outcome for the future, ""but what the most likely outcome is conditional upon the current stated policy of the government"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""Obviously, the outlook for policy as regards Brexit is not as clearly set out,"" he said.""We don't know what exactly the government is going to be aiming for and what could be delivered in the negotiations on things like the trade regime, migration.""We asked them whether they wanted to tell us any more about their policy in all of these areas than is already in the public domain - and they said 'no'.""Clearly it would have put us in a very difficult position if they had told us something and said we can't share that with the rest of the world.""Mr Chote said that as the likely shape of any post-Brexit settlement became clearer, it could feed into future forecasts - but he warned that was unlikely to happen quickly.""Will we end up in a world in which there are much lower tariffs both for us and for other countries? Are we going to end up with a very different-looking migration regime? That remains to be seen,"" he said.""We need the policy to clarify itself, but we also shouldn't delude ourselves that it is going to clarity itself very quickly."""
2016-11-26,Abuse inquiry 'handled assault claim badly',https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38095053,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHeads of the inquiry into child sexual abuse have been criticised by MPs for a ""wholly inadequate"" response to an internal allegation of sexual assault.The home affairs select committee said, given the inquiry's task, it should have treated the issue with ""rigour"".A woman on the inquiry team alleged she was groped in a lift at its offices.Inquiry chair Prof Alexis Jay, the fourth person to lead the inquiry, apologised for any unnecessary anxiety caused to victims or survivors.The troubled inquiry, launched by Theresa May when she was home secretary, has seen the departure of three chairs as well as its most senior and second-ranking counsel.In the latest setback, one of the largest victims' groups involved withdrew from the inquiry, calling it an ""unpalatable circus"". The move prompted calls for Prof Jay, who has the government's backing, to be replaced.Ben Emmerson QC, the most senior lawyer at the inquiry, resigned in September.The BBC's Newsnight programme has previously reported that the inquiry was told in September of a claim that Mr Emmerson had assaulted a woman working at its offices in a lift - a claim he has strenuously denied. The alleged victim did not want the incident investigated.In its report, the committee said it made no judgement on the claim, and suggested an external person could be appointed to examine the matter.""We are not in a position, and it is certainly not our responsibility, to assess either the facts of the case or the details of the processes that the inquiry pursued,"" the report said.""However, we do not believe that IICSA [the inquiry] has taken seriously enough its responsibility to pursue allegations of bullying or disclosures of sexual assault within the inquiry,"" it added.""Nor do we believe it has done enough to demonstrate publicly that it has a robust approach to such matters.""In a letter published by the committee alongside its report, Hugh Davies QC, a barrister who worked for the inquiry until December last year, said as a body judging how institutions dealt with this sort of allegation, it should ""expect to be judged by the same standards it will doubtless set for others"".Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the select committee, said the inquiry needed to sort out its problems fast and be less defensive about what had gone wrong.She said it was ""shameful"" that the previous chair, Dame Lowell Goddard, was refusing to give oral evidence about her sudden resignation this summer.The New Zealand high court judge previously told the committee that for her to be summoned would compromise the inquiry's ""independence and integrity"".MPs also urged the inquiry team to appoint new lawyers as soon as possible and suggested it split its workload into two strands - legal matters and child protection. Ms Cooper said: ""We found there was an unresolved tension over how far the inquiry should focus on uncovering the truth about past abuse and cover-ups and how far it should focus on current child protection policies. ""Both are important but they need different skills, experience and styles of work.""This inquiry is far too important to be sunk by problems. That's why urgent action is needed to sort them out. Survivors of abuse deserve nothing less."" In response, Prof Jay said an external senior legal figure would be invited to review some of the issues raised in the committee's report.""While I am confident that our safeguarding and dignity at work procedures are robust, I recognise the impact of recent speculation and commentary about them,"" she said.""Nobody is more determined to deliver a successful inquiry on behalf of victims, survivors and the wider public than the panel and myself.""We recognise that the past few months have been difficult for the inquiry and for the victims and survivors who have placed their trust in it.""I am personally sorry for any unnecessary anxiety the inquiry may have caused to victims and survivors during this transitional period.""She is expected to publish a review of how the inquiry operates in the coming weeks."

2016-11-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

What drives these ""Walter Mittys"" to invent fake tales of heroism?Maybe it starts down the pub. There's talk of the SAS, and you've read all the books. An exaggeration becomes an embellishment, and then a lie.People are impressed. You get carried away. Buy medals on eBay. Wear them to a Remembrance Day parade. Then you slip up. You get a detail wrong and someone notices. You're exposed as a fraud. A Walter Mitty.In military circles, the name of James Thurber's fictional fantasist is applied to the persistent band of hoaxers who, for whatever reason, boast of military records they haven't earned. Sometimes Walter Mitty is abbreviated to Walter, or just Walt.One well-publicised case involved Roger Day, who admitted he hadn't earned the 17 medals - including awards for serving in World War II, the Military Medal and SAS badges - that he wore at a 2009 parade in Warwickshire.In 2008, bus driver Jamie Barrett was spotted marching in Edinburgh with members of the Parachute Regiment who had served in the Falklands. He had bought his medals online. After he was exposed, Barrett said:  ""I'm basically a Walter Mitty type of person.""And last year, Oxford's town crier Anthony Church confessed to inventing a career in the armed forces. He had previously claimed he was a ""regimental sergeant major"" and had worn a Falklands medal.Most people would regard the concoction of fake tales of heroism as reprehensible.""It completely undermines genuine heroes,"" says Gareth Johnson, the MP for Dartford who introduced the proposed law - the Awards for Valour (Protection) Bill - that would make wearing unauthorised medals a criminal offence, punishable by prison or a £5,000 fine.""People who have served their country in genuinely dangerous environments, then someone comes along and pretends that they are their equal - that causes a lot of offence,"" he says. ""When people see veterans it's important that people have confidence their medals are legitimate.""Internet vigilante groups with names like the Walter Mitty Hunters Club are dedicated to uncovering and shaming them, and these exposes are regularly picked up and given extra publicity by an indignant tabloid press.But what actually motivates the Walter Mittys to concoct their often elaborate tales is not always obvious.In Day's case, a court was told he had started to make up stories to impress his new wife, who was 24 years his junior.Confronted after his exposure, Barrett's explanation for his behaviour was more prosaic: ""I had been collecting the medals and silliness got hold of me. I got a bit carried away, put the medals on and went. I didn't realise that it would upset other people.""One of the more spectacular cases of recent times involved Capt Sir Alan McIlwraith, CBE, DSO, MC, MiD - or, rather, plain Alan McIlwraith, a call-centre worker living on a Glasgow council estate who built up an elaborate fake persona as a highly decorated officer who had finished top of his class at Sandhurst and served in the Balkans.""The lie had just gone too deep, it's like a weed that invades your life. Once it's taken root, there's nothing you can do about it,"" McIlwraith, who was exposed as a fraud in 2006, told the Guardian. Some will have had no involvement with the armed forces whatsoever, Greenberg says. But others might embellish their own military service into something more impressive-sounding. Richard Lee claimed he had served with the Royal Marines' mountain troops when he set up the worldwide endurance competition, Spartan Race. In fact, it turned out he had enrolled in the Officer Training Corps but dropped out before qualifying.Just how many Walter Mittys there are isn't entirely clear.In evidence to the Commons Defence Committee, the Royal British Legion (RBL) said it in its experience ""instances of so-called 'Walter Mittys' appear to be rare"" while the The Royal Air Force Families Federation said the issue was ""not widespread"".However, 64% of 1,111 Naval Families Federation members surveyed over four days said they had personally encountered individuals wearing medals or insignia that had been awarded to someone else. Gareth Johnson says his own RBL branch has had to expel two members who concocted bogus military records.Neil Greenberg, professor of defence mental health at King's College London, also argues that the phenomenon is more widespread than you might expect.""I've seen more people who say they were at the Iranian embassy siege than were actually at the Iranian embassy siege,"" he says. Gareth Johnson says the UK is highly unusual in not already having legislation of the kind he proposes. The wearing of medals without authorisation was made illegal by Winston Churchill after World War One - but in 2006, when the new Armed Forces Act came into effect, this was effectively repealed. So although Roger Day pleaded guilty to falsely wearing medals in 2010, a community order imposed on him was scrapped after his lawyer noticed that this had stopped being an offence 11 days before the parade.Under the Fraud Act, anyone who uses medals for financial gain can be prosecuted - but if no such benefit can be proved, no offence has been committed. One man who did gain financially is Christopher Griffin, a bodyguard who falsely claimed to have been a British Army Captain for 11 years, who admitted two counts of fraud by false representation at Plymouth Magistrates Court last year.Neil Greenberg, who has assessed several military impostors, isn't convinced that stricter legislation will deter them.""It's often not fully conscious,"" he says.  They are typically fairly pathetic individuals, as he puts it, who are ""doing it to bolster their own self-esteem"". ""Their problems are greater than that they say they were in the SAS,"" he says. Many will have an ""abnormal or end-of-normal personality"", while a few will have serious mental health problems.Critics have warned that the bill before Parliament would end up targeting people who were mentally ill. Johnson says it would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether it was in the public interest to prosecute any individual accused of wearing medals they hadn't earned. He also says that people who wear medals won by relatives, to honour their memory, would not face prosecution.Johnson's proposed law has won the backing of ministers. ""I fully support this bill,"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says. ""Medals recognise our forces who risk their lives for our freedom. It's important their service is properly protected.""The Commons Defence Committee also backs the legislation. In its report on the proposed law, it concluded there is ""a tangible and identifiable harm created by military impostors"". Its chairman, Julian Lewis, said such ""contemptible fantasists"" need to be deterred.Even without the threat of prosecution, being unmasked as a Walter Mitty in the media or online can be devastating in its own right. The BBC contacted a number of men who had been unmasked as impostors. None was prepared to speak on the record, but several spoke of their deep shame and said they had contemplated suicide.Many will have no sympathy. But Greenberg says everyone should examine their own capacity for Walt-like behaviour.""Most people exaggerate,"" he says. ""There's an element of this in all of us.""

2016-11-26,Steering UK out of the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38089711,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNegotiations over leaving the EU are set to begin next year. Might one leading European official's love of many things British help things go a little more smoothly?One key to a Brexit deal could be a vintage Aston Martin. That, I have discovered, is what petrolhead Belgian MEP and EU Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt drives. An amateur rally enthusiast, Mr Verhofstadt shared some of his passion for cars with the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, during a meeting in Strasbourg this week. Mr Davis emerged beaming from the talks saying Mr Verhofstadt was great fun, saying: ""He's a very nice man. He races British cars and we got on very well."" A quote that suggests these early stages of non-negotiation could not be going better. He likes British cars! Mr Verhofstadt leads the liberal group in the European Parliament and will represent MEPs in the forthcoming negotiations with the UK. If you think of Nigel Farage at one end of the EU spectrum, Guy Verhofstadt is at the other. A passionate believer in the EU project, the former Belgian prime minister enjoys tormenting Eurosceptics as much as he enjoys tearing round a race track. His voice will matter as the UK tries to cut a divorce deal with the EU. So the fact that he, of all people, enjoys spending time with an oily rag and Aston Martin suggests an emotional tie to Britain that could colour his view of Brexit. And what about all the other EU negotiators and leaders? Holidays in Devon, a love of Adele, a taste for Marmite. All this might matter as the UK and the EU knuckle down to business. A process that government ministers like to say will be fairly straightforward. Theresa May talks about it being a ""smooth process"". Mr Davis has said he is confident a deal can be struck in the mutual interests of the UK and the rest of the EU. But if the UK thinks there can be a form of Gwyneth Paltrow-style ""conscious uncoupling"" with the EU that avoids the acrimonious misery of most divorces, I think they're wrong. No amount of affection for all things British is going to soften the EU's determination to make Brexit hard on the departing member state. A hint of this was in the curt and flinty comments by various MEPs after Mr Davis had gone.Mr Verhofstadt said the negotiations would be ""intense"" and there could be no compromise on the four freedoms underpinning the EU. The leader of the centre-right group of MEPs, Manfred Weber, was brusque, saying there could be no cherry-picking and no special deal between the UK and the EU.Speaking to officials and politicians off-the-record in Brussels last week, I did not hear much talk about a straightforward deal cut for mutual benefit. Instead, the aim is to find an exit for Britain that makes it clear to remaining EU states they are better off in the club than out of it. Of course, the EU does a lot of trade with the UK and member states do not want to jeopardise that. But I was also told by officials within the EU institutions that Brexit is an existential threat to the EU that has to be dealt with firmly. That might mean a divorce deal with the UK that puts politics ahead of economics. Which is exactly what many in Brussels think Theresa May's government has done by heavily hinting the UK wants to leave the single market but have access to it.As the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has already said, he thinks the choice for Britain will either be a hard Brexit or no Brexit. For the EU it is Mr Tusk who will lead the remaining 27 member states through the talks with UK. The nitty-gritty of negotiations will be done by the European Commission and a unit headed by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. But it is EU states who will have the final say on that side of the table.The mantra in Brussels is ""no negotiation without notification"". That means no talks with the UK until Theresa May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - a move she wants to make by the end of March 2017. There is impatience in the EU for the prime minister to get on with it. As Whitehall tries to work out what it wants from Brexit, a parallel process is under way in Brussels and there is a sense of mobilisation. Bilateral meetings are happening now between the EU Council and the remaining 27 member states on how the negotiations should work. This work is being led by Didier Seeuws, who runs the European Council's Brexit taskforce. These talks are not about the substance of the negotiation or red lines but about how the EU heads of government will feed into the Commission's work during Article 50 negotiations.Brexit is also expected be discussed among the 27 (without the UK) on the margins of the December European Council. Soon after Article 50 has been triggered, the EU Council of 27 will meet to agree the negotiation guidelines and discuss their starting position for talks. In Westminster it is often assumed the UK is in the driving seat for negotiations. That is not so. In the European Council's view, Article 50 is there to protect the interests of the remaining 27 EU members. I do not think there is a punitive mood towards Britain but there is a widespread expectation negotiations will be tougher and more complex than the UK realises.As one Commission official told me, unlike David Cameron's renegotiation, the UK will not have any ""friends"" in these talks. Each country will try to use Brexit to their press own advantage. France, in particular, sees a great opportunity for growing its own financial services sector after years of feeling thwarted by the UK. And with the various legal services of the EU institutions to use, the expertise of EU trade negotiators and the European Commission to draw upon, I was not discouraged from thinking the UK might be rather outgunned. One official told me the EU had a howitzer compared to the UK's peashooter.There has been a lot of speculation about whether Mrs May will seek a transitional deal with the EU; an arrangement that bridges the time between the UK leaving the EU and beginning a new trade relationship. It may not be her choice.Crucially, the European Council sees the Article 50 negotiations as limited to the divorce deal. In its view, talks about the future trade and security relationship between the UK and EU can only start after the UK has left, so parallel talks on a transitional arrangement are expected. It could all get very messy.If negotiations prove tough and more time is needed beyond the two-year Article 50 window, only the remaining 27 member states can agree to extend talks by unanimous agreement. Some senior officials in Brussels believe it is quite possible no agreement can be found and that either the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal reached or the government decides to pull the brake on the whole process. The European Council does not have a legal opinion on whether that is even possible and clearly in Britain that scenario is as politically far-fetched as it gets.But in contrast to the post-referendum phoney war that still prevails, Brexit will soon pit Westminster against a belligerent Brussels. A European fondness for classic British cars will count for very little."

But is this unparliamentary - or even bad manners - these days?It was John McDonnell's big day. The shadow chancellor stood at the House of Commons despatch box at 13.20 GMT to coruscate Philip Hammond over his Autumn Statement.Labour MPs were rapt as he did so. Some by his oratory; others, it seems, by the electronic devices in their hands. As the picture above shows, quite a few MPs, even some of his front bench colleagues, used their smartphones while he spoke.As the next picture shows, the activity was not confined to one side, Business Secretary Greg Clark looking at his while Mr Hammond answered questions.And even Mr McDonnell himself was distracted at one point by a mobile phone held by his shadow Treasury team colleague Jonathan Reynolds. Speaker John Bercow has previously warned MPs not to ""fiddle"" with their phones ""ostentatiously"" and suggested they go outside if they really can't resist the temptation.But is it right that this has to be spelt out in one of the world's premier debating chambers, where argument is supposed to be of paramount importance? Where Gladstone and Disraeli were supreme, where Churchill guided a nation through its most challenging times?Well, since 2007, Commons rules have stated that MPs can use mobiles ""to keep up to date with emails... provided that it causes no disturbance"".It sounds like a quaint provision today. Times have changed, as the Commons Procedure Committee notes: ""There are many new devices, including portable 'tablet' computers such as iPads or smartphones, which were not known to the Modernisation Committee which drew up the report which led to the House's resolution.""There are also new uses of technology, for example Twitter, which were similarly unknown but on which the Speaker and the Chair of any committee may be expected to rule, using the existing resolution as a guideline.""Conservative MP Nigel Mills issued an apology in 2014 for playing the mobile puzzle game Candy Crush Saga during a Commons committee hearing.Generally, though, tweeting from inside the chamber is seen as acceptable.Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told BBC 5 live: ""The world moves on. But it's not about being obvious, is it? It's about ensuring that you be discreet.""If he thought an MP was tapping away and staring downwards a little too noticeably, he would give them ""a nudge"", rather than shout across the chamber, he said.Mr Hoyle added: ""People want to stay in touch with the outside world now. They want to tell them what's going on. It's about keeping the balance right....""Everything moves on, as we know, in this world. When people talk to each other through a device without even speaking, you've got to wonder where does society end up. I hope we don't lose the ability to talk to each other.""Mr Hoyle also acknowledged that the guilty verdict following the trial of Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox had come through about an hour before Mr McDonnell began speaking, meaning there was more focus on news sites and social media than usual.But the rules are stronger in some other countries, irrespective of circumstance. In Greece, electronic devices are banned from the plenary hall, while the Finnish chamber prohibits the use of laptops.In the US, Congress has a rule stating: ""A person on the floor of the House may not smoke or use a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.""Mr McDonnell, when asked about the Autumn Statement scenes, told Sky News: ""What they do now in the Commons, and I'm not sure how this goes down with the general public, is that a lot of them will be tweeting their comments out about what's being said and they'll be responding to tweets etc.""It's changed the nature of the chamber itself... It's happening consistently now and you see it on all political parties too,""If answering emails is distracting, social media is more so.The Commons authorities recognise this: ""As an example of a practice which could not have been predicted by the Modernisation Committee in 2007, tweeting could hardly be bettered.""The procedure committee says it would be ""inconsistent"" to allow tweeting from the gallery overlooking the Commons but ban it from inside the chamber.But it urges MPs to ""use their good sense and behave with courtesy, particularly in not tweeting messages which would be disorderly if said in the House"".At least they are showing themselves to be in touch with normal life.Be thankful that none of them were gurning, thumbs up with arms around one another - selfies are a huge no-no, photography within the Palace of Westminster requiring prior permission."

2016-11-26,Brexit in the (EU) press,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38091976,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNewspaper commentators are debating whether other European countries can exploit any business flight from London as the process of the UK leaving the European Union begins.In a week when the forthcoming presidential election dominates the media, France's centre-left Le Monde still manages extensive coverage of Brexit developments.Its British correspondent Eric Albert is gloomy about the chances of an investment-led recovery after a visit to the northeast, where he saw high-tech jobs at one firm migrating to its subsidiary in Stuttgart. He says ""any recovery plan will be limited"" by Britain's straitened economic circumstances.In Austria, Karl Gaulhoer of Die Presse thinks the British government is cooking up a ""perfect recipe for a lose-lose Brexit"".He dismisses the ""few hundred jobs"" Facebook is creating in London and the incentives to the Nissan carmaker, saying a quick visit to the City of London shows people ""slowly packing their bags"".""Brexit certainly weakens the EU politically, but this self-declared divorce battle is cutting into Britain's economic flesh"".Le Monde's economics reporter Isabelle Chaperon thinks this could be good news for France, as the country's Strategic Investment Council this week saw more interest from financial and IT companies than usual.A representative of the Indian computer firm Infosys that employs far more people in Britain than France told her that, since the Brexit vote, they are now looking at Marseilles as an African business hub.Other business analysts told Le Monde that there is a chance for Paris to become a ""strong alternative to London"" - as long as France liberalises its tax regime.Nonetheless, the director of French Square, a French business incubator, told conservative Le Figaro that London remains the key city for start-ups.""London is an essential step for a start-up, often the first before tackling the US market, but also a test in what is a particularly competitive international market,"" said Charles Van Overmeire. The French Catholic paper La Croix puts Theresa May on its front page to flag up an article on whether the British prime minister is turning her back on the free-market consensus in favour of state intervention and immigration controls.It concludes that the conflicts in the government over hard or soft Brexit options explain Mrs May's ""sometimes erratic decisions"", and that in the end ""she may be so absorbed by Brexit that she will not have time for other matters"". German papers pursue Mrs May's pledge to have the lowest corporate taxes among the G20 countries, especially after she came in for stern criticism from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.Centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung saw this as part of an industrial and investment strategy aimed at making post-Brexit Britain attractive to investors in the ""robotics, artificial intelligence and industrial biotechnology fields"". But Bastian Brinkmann of the centre-left Sueddeutsche Zeitung is less phlegmatic, accusing Mrs May of ""declaring a tax war that will drag the rest of the EU into the abyss, just as most countries have come to their senses and are making an effort to fight tax evasion"".While many commentators point to confusion in London over Brexit, the paper's Brussels correspondent Daniel Broessler sees little sign of anything but ""scrambling"" in the approach to Brexit of the remaining EU states.It is clear that ""all leads converge on Michel Barnier"", the Commission's chief Brexit negotiator, but Mr Broessler says EU member states are unhappy with being ""merely informed through the sherpa system"" of what is going on, and that the role of the European Parliament in the process has not yet been clarified.In Italy, Antonio Armellini of Corriere della Sera also sees continuing problems with British and EU demands on the freedom of the movement of financial services and labour, seeing them as reflections of ""competing visions - Britain's trading bloc, and the European Union's political project"".""Germany's Angela Merkel doesn't want confrontation but, in a difficult election year, cannot afford to abandon EU orthodoxy,"" he says, while the Central European Visegrad Group ""has no hesitation when it comes to the fundamental freedom of movement"".Jedrzej Bielecki in Poland's Rzeczpospolita also thinks Mrs May ""cannot reconcile"" migration limits and full access to the single market.He is convinced that the EU will not relent on these points, ""because if it weakens the single market, nothing will remain of integration"".BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2016-11-26,Belt tightening,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38089190,"The size of the challenge facing a chancellor who has pledged an economy ""that works for everyone"" is becoming increasingly clear.And it is not just down to Brexit.After an Autumn Statement which abandoned pledges to hit a government budget surplus by 2020, new analysis claims the squeeze on living standards could be worse during this Parliament than between 2010 and 2015.The report by the Resolution Foundation says lower earnings and higher inflation could mean incomes growing less than half as fast between 2015 and 2020 compared to the years following the financial crisis and the recession that followed.It also says that the ""jobs miracle"" which saw unemployment fall below 5% ""would not be repeated"".The figures reveal the difficult position the government could find itself in by the next election after its pledge to support those who feel themselves to be ""just about managing"".The Resolution Foundation study said the freeze on benefits and rising inflation could mean the bottom third of earners seeing their incomes fall.The findings of the study are echoed in the Treasury's own ""distributional analysis"" which looks at the impact of tax, welfare and public spending pledges contained in the Autumn Statement.Those charts say that the bottom 30% of earners are likely to be worse off.Only the top 10% of earners will see as significant a hit, with middle income families slightly better off by 2020.The Resolution Foundation report, to be released later this morning and seen by the BBC, says: ""The weak outlook for real average earnings, which the OBR [the Office for Budget Responsibility] forecasts to be £830 lower in 2020 than previously expected, means that the decade from 2010 to 2020 is set to be the weakest one for wage growth since the 1900s.""Real weekly earnings are forecast to grow by just 1.6% over the decade, compared to 12.7% in the 2000s and over 20% in every other decade since the 1920s.""Sources close to Mr Hammond have told me the chancellor is well aware of the difficult economic situation he faces and say that is why he has made increases in UK productivity his priority.If through investment in skills and infrastructure he can create the conditions to allow the economy to perform better, then the OBR's forecasts may prove too gloomy.Interestingly, the chancellor relaxed the government's spending rules not to reverse the benefits freeze or cut taxes, but to invest in infrastructure (such as new roads) and ""innovation"", in short research and development skills.Economic models suggest there is a direct relationship between infrastructure spending, skills investment and better economic growth and therefore wage increases.Weak productivity growth was a major problem for the UK economy well before the vote to leave the European Union.But, although the government announced increased spending yesterday, if private sector investment falls due to the uncertainty following the Brexit decision, then that could more than wipe out all of the fresh money being offered by the government."

2016-11-26,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161127051107/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The legal question is focused on whether the UK is a member of the EEA in its own right or because it is a member of the EU.Professor George Yarrow, chairman of the Regulatory Policy Institute and emeritus professor at Hertford College, Oxford, said: ""There is no provision in the EEA Agreement for UK membership to lapse if the UK withdraws from the EU.  ""The only exit mechanism specified is Article 127, which would need to be triggered.""Jolyon Maugham QC of Devereux chambers said: ""My own view is that you do not automatically leave the EEA. Given Article 127 provides an express mechanism for withdrawal, it implicitly excludes other implied mechanisms for withdrawal such as ceasing to be a member of the EU.""The pro-single market think tank British Influence is writing to Brexit Secretary David Davis to inform him that it will seek a formal judicial review of the government's position.The group warned that if the government did not get a clear legal opinion it could potentially end up acting outside the law.In other Brexit developments:Pro-EU campaigners could now have another avenue for legal and parliamentary challenges to try to keep Britain inside the single market.At the the very least it would mean a lengthy legal process - potentially via the European Court of Justice - that could delay the government's Article 50 negotiations with the EU.If the courts say Article 127 does need to be triggered, there is the question of whether an act of Parliament would be needed for it to be authorised. The government is already fighting in the courts to stop MPs getting the final say over triggering the Article 50 Brexit negotiations.If MPs do get to decide on Article 127, they could potentially overcome the government's small majority and keep Britain inside the single market after Brexit. This would infuriate Brexiteers. But pro-EU campaigners say MPs would feel able to do this because people voted in the referendum to leave the EU and not the single market.A government spokesman insisted the UK was only in the EEA because of its membership of the EU and would leave after Brexit. The spokesman said the future relationship between the UK and the EU would be ""subject to negotiations"". ""The referendum result will be respected and we intend to invoke Article 50 no later than the end of March next year,"" he added. Conservative MP and Brexiteer Dominic Raab said: ""Rather than coming up with new legal wheezes to try and frustrate the will of the people, these lawyers should be working with us to make a success of Brexit. ""The public have spoken; we should respect the result and get on with it, not try to find new hurdles that undermine the democratic process."""

2016-11-27,MPs urged to back free school meals plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20161128061547/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38104241,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHead teachers are urging MPs to back a plan to ensure all children from poorer homes are automatically registered for free school meals.Parents often fail to apply for the meals for older pupils, says the National Association of Head Teachers. The NAHT wants MPs to add a clause on auto-registration to a bill being debated on Monday. It would ensure ""more children get the support they are entitled to"", said NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby. Until 2014 families had to apply for their children to have free school meals, which were open only to the most disadvantaged groups. That year, the coalition government introduced universal free school meals for all children in reception, Year 1 and Year 2. As all children were eligible, some low-income families stopped informing schools about their circumstances. The knock-on effect was that once their children reached Year 3, they began to miss out, not only on free meals to which they were entitled, but on extra educational funding linked to being registered for the meals. If adopted, an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill by four opposition MPs would automatically require local authorities to tell schools which of their pupils live in households claiming assistance such as housing benefit or council tax benefit and who would therefore be eligible for free meals.  Tony Draper, head of Water Hall Primary School in Bletchley near Milton Keynes, says registration rates for the meals there have dropped from 60% in 2014 to 28% this year. ""It's way too low for this area. This is one of the most deprived estates in the country.""Mr Draper argues that auto-registration would be a massive boost for families who are just about managing, a group the prime minister has said she wants to help. He says some parents are too proud to admit they are on benefits. ""Auto-registration would take this issue away. It would be easy for the government to do.""The Pupil Premium, a sum of money paid to schools to enhance the education of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, also depends on pupils being registered for free school meals. So if fewer parents apply for the meals, the school would get less Pupil Premium money and be less able to plan specialist help for children from low-income families, explained Mr Draper. If adopted, the new clause ""could deliver much-needed support and money for children and schools"", said Mr Hobby. The union says it would be an easy change and would show the government's ""true commitment to social mobility"". "
2016-11-27,'Cherry picking' warning on Brexit trade,https://web.archive.org//web/20161128061547/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38124131,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigners are urging the government not to ""cherry pick"" different parts of the economy for special trade agreements with the EU after Brexit.Three pro-EU MPs argue this approach risks creating ""losers"" because almost all sectors are linked to the EU.Tory Anna Soubry, Labour's Chuka Umunna and Lib Dem Nick Clegg all want the UK to remain in the EU single market.Pro-Brexit Tory Michael Gove says the single market is a ""bureaucratic web"" which the UK should leave.The three pro-EU MPs are part of Open Britain, which replaced the official Remain campaign after the EU referendum.At an event in London, they will present a report looking at different sectors of the UK economy and their links with the EU.Written by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, it says every sector appeared to benefit from trade within the single market with 3.25 million UK jobs directly or indirectly linked to EU trade.Manufacturing would ""certainly suffer significantly"" from restricted access to the single market, it says, while banking and insurance and professional services also have a ""very strong link"" to the EU and other sectors have ""indirect"" links.""Although it might seem theoretically possible to cherry pick a number of sectors and negotiate trade agreements for the sectors, there is considerable linkage between the sectors,"" the report says.""It has taken a quarter of a century to negotiate the single market as it exists today and could take nearly as long to renegotiate a new arrangement on a sectoral basis.""Any attempt to choose ""winners"" for free trade deals with the EU ""cannot be achieved without the risk of creating 'losers' through reduced access and reduced future mutual benefits"", it adds.Ms Soubry will say: ""There are no inevitable outcomes. There is no mandate for one particular Brexit option. The only question on the ballot paper was whether to leave, which we will, but how we execute our extraction must be debated.""The single market - which allows EU states to trade free of tariffs and other barriers - is central to the debate on what kind of deal the UK should seek when it leaves.EU leaders have said access to, or membership of, the single market is dependent on the UK continuing to accept the principle of free movement, while Downing Street says people voted for greater control over the UK's borders and says it will not compromise on immigration controls.Ministers have yet to set out in detail their negotiating aims, but say they want maximum possible access to the single market.Prime Minister Theresa May has also said the UK will not seek to replicate other countries' trading arrangements with the EU, saying she will be pressing for a ""bespoke"" deal.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said: ""The government has been clear that we want to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market - and let European businesses do the same here.""But we have also been clear that the UK should make its own decisions on controlling immigration and the authority of EU law should end.""It's not in the UK's interest to give a running commentary on our thinking that could undermine our negotiating position.""On Sunday, ex-minister and Vote Leave campaign chief Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I think when people voted to leave the European Union they voted to take back control of our money, our laws, trade deals and our borders.""That means that the single market, that is basically a bureaucratic web, we need to be out of.""In other Brexit news, 81 MPs and peers have signed a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk calling for a deal to protect the rights of both Britons living in other EU countries and EU nationals in the UK.The letter, co-ordinated by Conservative MP Michael Tomlinson, says people are not ""bargaining chips"" and calls for discussions to ""move forward quickly""."

The Howard League for Penal Reform said it had been notified of 102 suicides so far this year, the highest since its records began in 1978. The charity said suicides in prisons had reached ""epidemic proportions"".The government has pledged 2,500 extra officers and special measures for vulnerable or mentally ill inmates. The Howard League released the figures on suicide as it published a joint report alongside Centre for Mental Health, another charity. The previous highest suicide rate was 94 deaths during 2004. It said the rise in prison suicides had coincided with cuts to prison staffing and budgets, along with an increase in the number of people in prison, which had resulted in overcrowding.The report said there had been a rise in violence in prisons at a time when inmates were spending up to 23 hours a day locked in their cells.Howard League chief executive Frances Crook said: ""The number of people dying by suicide in prison has reached epidemic proportions.""No one should be so desperate while in the care of the state that they take their own life, and yet every three days a family is told that a loved one has died behind bars.""Cutting staff and prison budgets while allowing the number of people behind bars to grow unchecked has created a toxic mix of violence, death and human misery.""The report called for the incentives and earned privileges scheme in prisons to be scrapped, saying it was having a ""detrimental impact"" on inmates' wellbeing. The scheme allows prisoners to earn benefits in exchange for behaving responsibly. But the report said it was leading to some prisoners having limits placed on family contact, physical activity and access to money and possessions.The prison service has come under the spotlight recently, with thousands of officers protesting over concerns about safety earlier this month. It came after a string of high-profile incidents including the escape of two inmates, who were later recaptured.This month former Justice Secretary Michael Gove warned that too many people are being sent to prison, while the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd suggested more criminals could be punished without being jailed.Earlier this month, Justice Secretary Liz Truss unveiled a White Paper detailing a £1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for more prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors.A government spokeswoman said mental health in custody was taken ""extremely seriously"" and there were ""a range of measures already in place to help support prisoners"".She added: ""But we recognise that more can be done. That is why have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers, allocated more funding for prison safety and have launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project to address the increase in self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in our prisons.""

The report wants farmers to be rewarded for: The Green Alliance research goes further, though, by calculating the balance between spending on flood prevention and flood repairs. It concludes that £613m is spent on the after-effects of flooding, whilst hard flood defences receive less than half that - £269m.The report is in line with current thinking promoting natural flood defences. The government announced last week that it would set aside £15m for solutions which help slow the flow of water off the uplands to prevent it rushing downstream. Environmentalists said it was not enough, but these innovative schemes are in their infancy and even their supporters agree that they need testing on a river catchment scale.What is more, Green Alliance said the principles of spending on land management need more fundamental review.Under current arrangements, subsidised farming methods can:MPs on the Commons Environment Committee recently suggested that decision-making over flooding should be taken away from the Environment Agency. Green Alliance wants flood managements and prevention given to regional-scale catchment boards.Angela Francis from Green Alliance said: “We are spending hundreds of millions of pounds of public money in ways that are perverse. “Just by allocating current funding more rationally the government could reduce the burden on the public purse, save vulnerable communities from the misery of flooding, and increase the health of our natural environment.”Patrick Begg, from the National Trust, said that Brexit created an opportunity to ""create a system that rewards and incentivises farmers and land managers"" to reduce the flow of flood waters through natural solutions.The National Farmers Union is happy for farmers to be paid to catch water on their land, but fears that farms grants overall will be cut when the UK leaves the Common Agricultural Policy. A spokesman for the environment department Defra has told the BBC it was ""committed"" to flood protection. “Natural flood management plays an important role in our strategy - that is why last week we announced a further £15m funding for these schemes,"" the spokesman said. “We’re spending a record £2.5bn on flood defences to better protect 300,000 more homes by 2021 and many of these projects are also already using natural flood management measures.”Follow Roger on Twitter at @rharribin."

Prosecutors said the attack was ""nothing less than acts of terrorism"" and the judge said it was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism. Mr Isaac emphasised that human rights were ""not just for the minority"".""We do need to ensure we come up with the right solutions for Britain when we leave the European Union... we know there are people who feel disenfranchised,"" he told BBC Breakfast.Mr Isaac said the media had a role to play but sometimes coverage was ""unsympathetic and actually misleading"".The commission, an independent statutory body which advises on equality and human rights law, said: ""We are concerned that attacks on supporters of both sides of the Brexit debate have polarised many parts of the country. ""There are those who used, and continue to use, public concern about immigration policy and the economy to legitimise hate. ""The vast majority of people who voted to leave the European Union did so because they believe it is best for Britain and not because they are intolerant of others.""It describes the Brexit vote as a ""defining moment"" for the country, saying that while the focus has been on the economic and trading implications there should also be a ""discussion on what values we hold as a country"".The letter also criticises the government's aborted plan to demand companies set out the proportion of foreigners they employ, which was announced by Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Conservative Party conference in October.It said ""politicians of all sides should be aware of the effect on national mood of their words and policies, even when they are not enacted"". The letter also mentioned the discussion around child migrants, ""where dialogue escalated to irrational levels"". And it said there had been an ""ambivalent reception"" to claims of anti-Semitism in politics, an issue that BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said had dogged the Labour Party in particular. The commission welcomed the government's planned action on hate crime but suggested there should also be a review of the sentences for hate crimes in England and Wales. Home Office figures released in October showed racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41% in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU.The Home Office said there was ""absolutely no excuse"" for such offences and extra money had been allocated to tackle the issue.Mr Green, the work and pensions secretary, said political discourse was ""one of the things that is wrong with this country"".He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""It's become abusive, it's become personal, and it's not good for democracy."""

She declined to rule out a second referendum on the terms of the final Brexit deal.Asked whether she agreed with Tony Blair and Sir John Major that a second referendum should not be ruled out, she said the Brexit process should be taken ""in stages"", adding that it was impossible to have a debate about how to leave the EU because of the lack of information provided by the government.She urged ministers to ""come out of their darkened room"" and set out their negotiating strategy, adding: ""Let us start with what it is the government wants to negotiate and then we can have a reaction from the public and a proper debate, and then we can decide how to proceed.""Also on Marr, former cabinet minister and Vote Leave campaign chief Michael Gove said the single market was a ""bureaucratic web"" which the UK should leave, as well as exiting the customs union. He called for a ""fair migration policy which does not discriminate between EU citizens and others"".Mr Gove also warned against attempts to over-complicate Brexit and suggested that transitional measures could be an attempt to keep the UK in the EU."

And in an interview, also in the Sunday Times, she admitted that the complexities of Brexit was something that kept her awake at night. However, she said she wanted to ""get on with the deal"" of leaving the EU.Mr Carney reportedly hosted a dinner last Monday at Chatham House for about 50 senior investment bankers and a second on Wednesday for finance directors of the high street banks.The Sunday Times said he urged business leaders to unite around a common goal of securing adequate transition time to allow business to adapt and cushion the wider economy. It would mean the UK using current EU trading rules at least until 2021.Mr Carney's view is that this would not only be in the interests of the UK, but also the EU. Bank independence 'should be curbed'Bank sees sharp rise in inflation in 2017The governor's belief that there needs to be an adequate transition period is not new, however, and sources at the bank rejected reports that he had been in ""secret talks"" and ""plots"" last week.On 15 November, Mr Carney told the Treasury Committee that it would be in the interests of British companies, especially in the financial sector, to have a transitional deal to cover the period between leaving the EU and the finalising of new trade deals.He told the committee: ""Just to be absolutely clear, what I mean by that is I am not talking about staying in the European Union,""However, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, leading Brexit campaigner Mr Gove said: ""I'm open to the case for a transitional agreement but I'm not convinced we need one. Again, there is a tendency to over-complicate this process.""He added that his ""worry"" is that ""there are some people who can't get over the fact that the British people have voted to leave the EU and want us to have a transitional arrangement which is as close as possible"" to EU membership as a way of avoiding Brexit.Mr Gove criticised the use of the term ""hard Brexit"" as it was ""designed to make a liberation sound like a punishment"".Mr Carney has been criticised by pro-Leave campaigners for allegedly making pro-Remain comments, something the governor denies. The Bank of England does not have any role in the Brexit negotiations with the EU but can provide technical assistance to the UK government.Mr Carney, who is due to step down in 2019, has been robust in defence of Bank's operational independence since June's referendum.Last month he said BoE officials would not ""take instruction"" from politicians, a week after Mrs May had highlighted the ""bad side-effects"" of the Bank's near-zero interest rates and said a change had to come.

Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages.It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards.The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment.Its proposals will include:As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role.Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives.In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to £3.4m.As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia.A government source said: ""Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services.""The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance.""Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business.""The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios.The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay.A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent.It also said that pay ratios do not ""lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies"" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating ""perverse incentives"".Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a ""Fair Pay Charter"" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay."

2016-11-27,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161128061547/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"

What drives these ""Walter Mittys"" to invent fake tales of heroism?Maybe it starts down the pub. There's talk of the SAS, and you've read all the books. An exaggeration becomes an embellishment, and then a lie.People are impressed. You get carried away. Buy medals on eBay. Wear them to a Remembrance Day parade. Then you slip up. You get a detail wrong and someone notices. You're exposed as a fraud. A Walter Mitty.In military circles, the name of James Thurber's fictional fantasist is applied to the persistent band of hoaxers who, for whatever reason, boast of military records they haven't earned. Sometimes Walter Mitty is abbreviated to Walter, or just Walt.One well-publicised case involved Roger Day, who admitted he hadn't earned the 17 medals - including awards for serving in World War II, the Military Medal and SAS badges - that he wore at a 2009 parade in Warwickshire.In 2008, bus driver Jamie Barrett was spotted marching in Edinburgh with members of the Parachute Regiment who had served in the Falklands. He had bought his medals online. After he was exposed, Barrett said:  ""I'm basically a Walter Mitty type of person.""And last year, Oxford's town crier Anthony Church confessed to inventing a career in the armed forces. He had previously claimed he was a ""regimental sergeant major"" and had worn a Falklands medal.Most people would regard the concoction of fake tales of heroism as reprehensible.""It completely undermines genuine heroes,"" says Gareth Johnson, the MP for Dartford who introduced the proposed law - the Awards for Valour (Protection) Bill - that would make wearing unauthorised medals a criminal offence, punishable by prison or a £5,000 fine.""People who have served their country in genuinely dangerous environments, then someone comes along and pretends that they are their equal - that causes a lot of offence,"" he says. ""When people see veterans it's important that people have confidence their medals are legitimate.""Internet vigilante groups with names like the Walter Mitty Hunters Club are dedicated to uncovering and shaming them, and these exposes are regularly picked up and given extra publicity by an indignant tabloid press.But what actually motivates the Walter Mittys to concoct their often elaborate tales is not always obvious.In Day's case, a court was told he had started to make up stories to impress his new wife, who was 24 years his junior.Confronted after his exposure, Barrett's explanation for his behaviour was more prosaic: ""I had been collecting the medals and silliness got hold of me. I got a bit carried away, put the medals on and went. I didn't realise that it would upset other people.""One of the more spectacular cases of recent times involved Capt Sir Alan McIlwraith, CBE, DSO, MC, MiD - or, rather, plain Alan McIlwraith, a call-centre worker living on a Glasgow council estate who built up an elaborate fake persona as a highly decorated officer who had finished top of his class at Sandhurst and served in the Balkans.""The lie had just gone too deep, it's like a weed that invades your life. Once it's taken root, there's nothing you can do about it,"" McIlwraith, who was exposed as a fraud in 2006, told the Guardian. Some will have had no involvement with the armed forces whatsoever, Greenberg says. But others might embellish their own military service into something more impressive-sounding. Richard Lee claimed he had served with the Royal Marines' mountain troops when he set up the worldwide endurance competition, Spartan Race. In fact, it turned out he had enrolled in the Officer Training Corps but dropped out before qualifying.Just how many Walter Mittys there are isn't entirely clear.In evidence to the Commons Defence Committee, the Royal British Legion (RBL) said it in its experience ""instances of so-called 'Walter Mittys' appear to be rare"" while the The Royal Air Force Families Federation said the issue was ""not widespread"".However, 64% of 1,111 Naval Families Federation members surveyed over four days said they had personally encountered individuals wearing medals or insignia that had been awarded to someone else. Gareth Johnson says his own RBL branch has had to expel two members who concocted bogus military records.Neil Greenberg, professor of defence mental health at King's College London, also argues that the phenomenon is more widespread than you might expect.""I've seen more people who say they were at the Iranian embassy siege than were actually at the Iranian embassy siege,"" he says. Gareth Johnson says the UK is highly unusual in not already having legislation of the kind he proposes. The wearing of medals without authorisation was made illegal by Winston Churchill after World War One - but in 2006, when the new Armed Forces Act came into effect, this was effectively repealed. So although Roger Day pleaded guilty to falsely wearing medals in 2010, a community order imposed on him was scrapped after his lawyer noticed that this had stopped being an offence 11 days before the parade.Under the Fraud Act, anyone who uses medals for financial gain can be prosecuted - but if no such benefit can be proved, no offence has been committed. One man who did gain financially is Christopher Griffin, a bodyguard who falsely claimed to have been a British Army Captain for 11 years, who admitted two counts of fraud by false representation at Plymouth Magistrates Court last year.Neil Greenberg, who has assessed several military impostors, isn't convinced that stricter legislation will deter them.""It's often not fully conscious,"" he says.  They are typically fairly pathetic individuals, as he puts it, who are ""doing it to bolster their own self-esteem"". ""Their problems are greater than that they say they were in the SAS,"" he says. Many will have an ""abnormal or end-of-normal personality"", while a few will have serious mental health problems.Critics have warned that the bill before Parliament would end up targeting people who were mentally ill. Johnson says it would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether it was in the public interest to prosecute any individual accused of wearing medals they hadn't earned. He also says that people who wear medals won by relatives, to honour their memory, would not face prosecution.Johnson's proposed law has won the backing of ministers. ""I fully support this bill,"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says. ""Medals recognise our forces who risk their lives for our freedom. It's important their service is properly protected.""The Commons Defence Committee also backs the legislation. In its report on the proposed law, it concluded there is ""a tangible and identifiable harm created by military impostors"". Its chairman, Julian Lewis, said such ""contemptible fantasists"" need to be deterred.Even without the threat of prosecution, being unmasked as a Walter Mitty in the media or online can be devastating in its own right. The BBC contacted a number of men who had been unmasked as impostors. None was prepared to speak on the record, but several spoke of their deep shame and said they had contemplated suicide.Many will have no sympathy. But Greenberg says everyone should examine their own capacity for Walt-like behaviour.""Most people exaggerate,"" he says. ""There's an element of this in all of us.""

2016-11-27,Steering UK out of the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20161128061547/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38089711,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkNegotiations over leaving the EU are set to begin next year. Might one leading European official's love of many things British help things go a little more smoothly?One key to a Brexit deal could be a vintage Aston Martin. That, I have discovered, is what petrolhead Belgian MEP and EU Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt drives. An amateur rally enthusiast, Mr Verhofstadt shared some of his passion for cars with the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, during a meeting in Strasbourg this week. Mr Davis emerged beaming from the talks saying Mr Verhofstadt was great fun, saying: ""He's a very nice man. He races British cars and we got on very well."" A quote that suggests these early stages of non-negotiation could not be going better. He likes British cars! Mr Verhofstadt leads the liberal group in the European Parliament and will represent MEPs in the forthcoming negotiations with the UK. If you think of Nigel Farage at one end of the EU spectrum, Guy Verhofstadt is at the other. A passionate believer in the EU project, the former Belgian prime minister enjoys tormenting Eurosceptics as much as he enjoys tearing round a race track. His voice will matter as the UK tries to cut a divorce deal with the EU. So the fact that he, of all people, enjoys spending time with an oily rag and Aston Martin suggests an emotional tie to Britain that could colour his view of Brexit. And what about all the other EU negotiators and leaders? Holidays in Devon, a love of Adele, a taste for Marmite. All this might matter as the UK and the EU knuckle down to business. A process that government ministers like to say will be fairly straightforward. Theresa May talks about it being a ""smooth process"". Mr Davis has said he is confident a deal can be struck in the mutual interests of the UK and the rest of the EU. But if the UK thinks there can be a form of Gwyneth Paltrow-style ""conscious uncoupling"" with the EU that avoids the acrimonious misery of most divorces, I think they're wrong. No amount of affection for all things British is going to soften the EU's determination to make Brexit hard on the departing member state. A hint of this was in the curt and flinty comments by various MEPs after Mr Davis had gone.Mr Verhofstadt said the negotiations would be ""intense"" and there could be no compromise on the four freedoms underpinning the EU. The leader of the centre-right group of MEPs, Manfred Weber, was brusque, saying there could be no cherry-picking and no special deal between the UK and the EU.Speaking to officials and politicians off-the-record in Brussels last week, I did not hear much talk about a straightforward deal cut for mutual benefit. Instead, the aim is to find an exit for Britain that makes it clear to remaining EU states they are better off in the club than out of it. Of course, the EU does a lot of trade with the UK and member states do not want to jeopardise that. But I was also told by officials within the EU institutions that Brexit is an existential threat to the EU that has to be dealt with firmly. That might mean a divorce deal with the UK that puts politics ahead of economics. Which is exactly what many in Brussels think Theresa May's government has done by heavily hinting the UK wants to leave the single market but have access to it.As the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has already said, he thinks the choice for Britain will either be a hard Brexit or no Brexit. For the EU it is Mr Tusk who will lead the remaining 27 member states through the talks with UK. The nitty-gritty of negotiations will be done by the European Commission and a unit headed by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. But it is EU states who will have the final say on that side of the table.The mantra in Brussels is ""no negotiation without notification"". That means no talks with the UK until Theresa May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - a move she wants to make by the end of March 2017. There is impatience in the EU for the prime minister to get on with it. As Whitehall tries to work out what it wants from Brexit, a parallel process is under way in Brussels and there is a sense of mobilisation. Bilateral meetings are happening now between the EU Council and the remaining 27 member states on how the negotiations should work. This work is being led by Didier Seeuws, who runs the European Council's Brexit taskforce. These talks are not about the substance of the negotiation or red lines but about how the EU heads of government will feed into the Commission's work during Article 50 negotiations.Brexit is also expected be discussed among the 27 (without the UK) on the margins of the December European Council. Soon after Article 50 has been triggered, the EU Council of 27 will meet to agree the negotiation guidelines and discuss their starting position for talks. In Westminster it is often assumed the UK is in the driving seat for negotiations. That is not so. In the European Council's view, Article 50 is there to protect the interests of the remaining 27 EU members. I do not think there is a punitive mood towards Britain but there is a widespread expectation negotiations will be tougher and more complex than the UK realises.As one Commission official told me, unlike David Cameron's renegotiation, the UK will not have any ""friends"" in these talks. Each country will try to use Brexit to their press own advantage. France, in particular, sees a great opportunity for growing its own financial services sector after years of feeling thwarted by the UK. And with the various legal services of the EU institutions to use, the expertise of EU trade negotiators and the European Commission to draw upon, I was not discouraged from thinking the UK might be rather outgunned. One official told me the EU had a howitzer compared to the UK's peashooter.There has been a lot of speculation about whether Mrs May will seek a transitional deal with the EU; an arrangement that bridges the time between the UK leaving the EU and beginning a new trade relationship. It may not be her choice.Crucially, the European Council sees the Article 50 negotiations as limited to the divorce deal. In its view, talks about the future trade and security relationship between the UK and EU can only start after the UK has left, so parallel talks on a transitional arrangement are expected. It could all get very messy.If negotiations prove tough and more time is needed beyond the two-year Article 50 window, only the remaining 27 member states can agree to extend talks by unanimous agreement. Some senior officials in Brussels believe it is quite possible no agreement can be found and that either the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal reached or the government decides to pull the brake on the whole process. The European Council does not have a legal opinion on whether that is even possible and clearly in Britain that scenario is as politically far-fetched as it gets.But in contrast to the post-referendum phoney war that still prevails, Brexit will soon pit Westminster against a belligerent Brussels. A European fondness for classic British cars will count for very little."
2016-11-27,Phones out of order?,https://web.archive.org//web/20161128061547/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38093758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEyebrows have been raised by pictures showing several MPs using their smartphones during Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell's Autumn Statement speech. But is this unparliamentary - or even bad manners - these days?It was John McDonnell's big day. The shadow chancellor stood at the House of Commons despatch box at 13.20 GMT to coruscate Philip Hammond over his Autumn Statement.Labour MPs were rapt as he did so. Some by his oratory; others, it seems, by the electronic devices in their hands. As the picture above shows, quite a few MPs, even some of his front bench colleagues, used their smartphones while he spoke.As the next picture shows, the activity was not confined to one side, Business Secretary Greg Clark looking at his while Mr Hammond answered questions.And even Mr McDonnell himself was distracted at one point by a mobile phone held by his shadow Treasury team colleague Jonathan Reynolds. Speaker John Bercow has previously warned MPs not to ""fiddle"" with their phones ""ostentatiously"" and suggested they go outside if they really can't resist the temptation.But is it right that this has to be spelt out in one of the world's premier debating chambers, where argument is supposed to be of paramount importance? Where Gladstone and Disraeli were supreme, where Churchill guided a nation through its most challenging times?Well, since 2007, Commons rules have stated that MPs can use mobiles ""to keep up to date with emails... provided that it causes no disturbance"".It sounds like a quaint provision today. Times have changed, as the Commons Procedure Committee notes: ""There are many new devices, including portable 'tablet' computers such as iPads or smartphones, which were not known to the Modernisation Committee which drew up the report which led to the House's resolution.""There are also new uses of technology, for example Twitter, which were similarly unknown but on which the Speaker and the Chair of any committee may be expected to rule, using the existing resolution as a guideline.""Conservative MP Nigel Mills issued an apology in 2014 for playing the mobile puzzle game Candy Crush Saga during a Commons committee hearing.Generally, though, tweeting from inside the chamber is seen as acceptable.Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told BBC 5 live: ""The world moves on. But it's not about being obvious, is it? It's about ensuring that you be discreet.""If he thought an MP was tapping away and staring downwards a little too noticeably, he would give them ""a nudge"", rather than shout across the chamber, he said.Mr Hoyle added: ""People want to stay in touch with the outside world now. They want to tell them what's going on. It's about keeping the balance right....""Everything moves on, as we know, in this world. When people talk to each other through a device without even speaking, you've got to wonder where does society end up. I hope we don't lose the ability to talk to each other.""Mr Hoyle also acknowledged that the guilty verdict following the trial of Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox had come through about an hour before Mr McDonnell began speaking, meaning there was more focus on news sites and social media than usual.But the rules are stronger in some other countries, irrespective of circumstance. In Greece, electronic devices are banned from the plenary hall, while the Finnish chamber prohibits the use of laptops.In the US, Congress has a rule stating: ""A person on the floor of the House may not smoke or use a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.""Mr McDonnell, when asked about the Autumn Statement scenes, told Sky News: ""What they do now in the Commons, and I'm not sure how this goes down with the general public, is that a lot of them will be tweeting their comments out about what's being said and they'll be responding to tweets etc.""It's changed the nature of the chamber itself... It's happening consistently now and you see it on all political parties too,""If answering emails is distracting, social media is more so.The Commons authorities recognise this: ""As an example of a practice which could not have been predicted by the Modernisation Committee in 2007, tweeting could hardly be bettered.""The procedure committee says it would be ""inconsistent"" to allow tweeting from the gallery overlooking the Commons but ban it from inside the chamber.But it urges MPs to ""use their good sense and behave with courtesy, particularly in not tweeting messages which would be disorderly if said in the House"".At least they are showing themselves to be in touch with normal life.Be thankful that none of them were gurning, thumbs up with arms around one another - selfies are a huge no-no, photography within the Palace of Westminster requiring prior permission."

2016-11-27,Belt tightening,https://web.archive.org//web/20161128061547/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38089190,"The size of the challenge facing a chancellor who has pledged an economy ""that works for everyone"" is becoming increasingly clear.And it is not just down to Brexit.After an Autumn Statement which abandoned pledges to hit a government budget surplus by 2020, new analysis claims the squeeze on living standards could be worse during this Parliament than between 2010 and 2015.The report by the Resolution Foundation says lower earnings and higher inflation could mean incomes growing less than half as fast between 2015 and 2020 compared to the years following the financial crisis and the recession that followed.It also says that the ""jobs miracle"" which saw unemployment fall below 5% ""would not be repeated"".The figures reveal the difficult position the government could find itself in by the next election after its pledge to support those who feel themselves to be ""just about managing"".The Resolution Foundation study said the freeze on benefits and rising inflation could mean the bottom third of earners seeing their incomes fall.The findings of the study are echoed in the Treasury's own ""distributional analysis"" which looks at the impact of tax, welfare and public spending pledges contained in the Autumn Statement.Those charts say that the bottom 30% of earners are likely to be worse off.Only the top 10% of earners will see as significant a hit, with middle income families slightly better off by 2020.The Resolution Foundation report, to be released later this morning and seen by the BBC, says: ""The weak outlook for real average earnings, which the OBR [the Office for Budget Responsibility] forecasts to be £830 lower in 2020 than previously expected, means that the decade from 2010 to 2020 is set to be the weakest one for wage growth since the 1900s.""Real weekly earnings are forecast to grow by just 1.6% over the decade, compared to 12.7% in the 2000s and over 20% in every other decade since the 1920s.""Sources close to Mr Hammond have told me the chancellor is well aware of the difficult economic situation he faces and say that is why he has made increases in UK productivity his priority.If through investment in skills and infrastructure he can create the conditions to allow the economy to perform better, then the OBR's forecasts may prove too gloomy.Interestingly, the chancellor relaxed the government's spending rules not to reverse the benefits freeze or cut taxes, but to invest in infrastructure (such as new roads) and ""innovation"", in short research and development skills.Economic models suggest there is a direct relationship between infrastructure spending, skills investment and better economic growth and therefore wage increases.Weak productivity growth was a major problem for the UK economy well before the vote to leave the European Union.But, although the government announced increased spending yesterday, if private sector investment falls due to the uncertainty following the Brexit decision, then that could more than wipe out all of the fresh money being offered by the government."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

2016-11-28,Paul Nuttall elected as UKIP leader,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38125432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPaul Nuttall has been elected leader of the UK Independence Party, replacing Nigel Farage.The 39-year-old Member of the European Parliament, who served as UKIP's deputy leader for six years, won 62.6% of support among party members.He promised to ""put the great back into Britain"" and force the government to ""give us a real Brexit"".Mr Nuttall defeated former deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans and ex-soldier John Rees-Evans.It was UKIP's second leadership election this year, previous winner Diane James having quit after 18 days in the role. Mr Farage acted as interim leader while the second leadership race took place.In his acceptance speech, Mr Nuttall, a former history lecturer who played football for Tranmere Rovers as a boy, said: ""The country needs a strong UKIP more than ever before. If UKIP is to be an electoral force, there will be an impetus on Theresa May and her government to give us a real Brexit.""He added: ""I want to replace the Labour Party and make UKIP the patriotic voice of working people.""Appearing on BBC Two's Daily Politics, Mr Nuttall said the party would be ""speaking the language of ordinary working people... we're going to move into the areas the Labour Party has neglected"", dismissing Labour leader leader Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell and Diane Abbott as part of ""a North London  Islington set"".He said: ""We will be focusing on the issues that really matter to working-class people on doorsteps - immigration, crime, defence, foreign aid, ensuring that British people are put to the top of the queue in the job market.""Ms Evans said Mr Nuttall had her ""full support"", saying she was glad he won such a decisive victory because it gave him a ""huge mandate"" to unite the party.Mr Nuttall, who was born in Bootle, Merseyside and was UKIP deputy leader from 2010 until September this year, attracted 9,622 votes. Ms Evans came second with 2,973 votes (19.3%) and Mr Rees-Evans third with 2,775 votes (18.1%). There were 32,757 ballot papers sent out, with 15,405 votes cast.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Now on their third leader in as many months, UKIP are too divided, distracted and incompetent to offer any serious solutions for the people of Britain. ""After a leadership contest, which the winner himself has described as 'completely shambolic', we've seen brawls and squabbling - but nothing about the issues facing ordinary working people.""Labour MP Dan Jarvis said the party could not be ""remotely complacent"" about the threat posed by UKIP and had to listen to voter concerns about issues like immigration. He called for the party to appoint a frontbencher to deal specifically with the issue.But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said this was not necessary, telling BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Jarvis ""clearly has not been talking to many people in Europe"" if he thought changes could be made to EU free movement rules while being involved with the single market.She added: ""The fact is that immigrants themselves are not responsible for low wages.""Analysis - Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editorThis was a commanding, thumping win for Paul Nuttall. The scale of his victory matters. His pitch was that he was the only person able to bring the party together and heal its divisions and this gives him a mandate to do so. His approach will be different from that of Nigel Farage, whose focus was on appealing to Tory voters. Mr Nuttall wants UKIP to become the authentic voice of the working class by talking about issues that Labour finds problematic.It was no coincidence he spent much of his speech attacking Jeremy Corbyn and his allies. Beating Labour in the North of England will be a mountainous task - and it remains to be seen how this strategy will appeal to the party's libertarian wing - but it is not impossible, as the SNP has proved in Scotland. But first he will have to deal with the huge tensions and personal animosities in the party. He will take comfort from Mr Farage's insistence he won't be a back-seat driver. UKIP has been plagued by disputes between senior figures over the summer, with some leaving the party.But Mr Nuttall, an MEP for North West England, said, under his leadership: ""There will be one theme - unity - because only unity breeds success.""Mr Nuttall's first act as leader was to appoint London Assembly member Peter Whittle as his deputy. He also offered Mr Farage joint honorary presidency of the party.Paul Oakden will stay on as party chairman and MEP Patrick O'Flynn - a close ally of leadership rival Suzanne Evans - will be his principal political adviser.Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only Westminster MP, tweeted: ""Thrilled and delighted by UKIP new leader Paul Nuttall - clear new strategic direction!""But Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron predicted Mr Farage would be ""back in the leadership after a few weeks of recharging his batteries stateside"", adding: ""UKIP do not speak for Britain and their brand of reactionary, divisive politics threatens the character and cohesion of our society.""Speaking ahead of Mr Nuttall's election, Mr Farage said he had a ""certain sense of déjà vu"" given the party had only had a leadership election in September but insisted he was stepping back and would not be a ""back-seat driver"".He said he was ""confident"" about UKIP's future, saying it had shifted the ""centre of political gravity"" in UK politics and had been the inspiration for Eurosceptics across Europe but also Donald Trump's successful presidential campaign in the US.Timeline: Previous UKIP leadersDiane James (September-October 2016): UKIP's first female leader only lasted 18 days in the job, saying she lacked authority. The MEP later quit the partyNigel Farage (2006-2009 and 2010-2016): The face of UKIP for more than a decade, he served two stints as leader, during which UKIP became a major force in British politics. He quit briefly in 2009 and again in 2015 only to change his mind. Lord Pearson (2009-2010): The former Conservative peer was elected leader in late 2009 but the party underperformed at the 2010 election and he quit soon after, saying he was not ""much good"" at party politics.Roger Knapman (2002-2006): A former Conservative MP, he joined UKIP after the 1997 election and became leader in 2002. Stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2001 before becoming an MEP in 2004. Stood down in 2006.Jeffrey Titford: (2000-2002): A popular figure who led UKIP into the 2001 election and served as an MEP for a decade.Michael Holmes (1997-1999): Served as leader for two years and was elected to the European Parliament before quitting after an internal power struggle in 1999. Subsequently left the party.Craig McKinlay (1997): Served as interim leader for a few months in 1997, latterly serving as deputy. Contested three general elections as a UKIP candidate before defecting to the Tories and winning the Thanet South seat in 2015 - beating Nigel FarageAlan Sked (1993-1997): Formed the Anti-Federalist league, which later morphed into UKIP. The academic has since been critical of UKIP, describing it as ""Frankenstein's monster""."
2016-11-28,Government plays down Brexit notes pic,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38134859,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has distanced itself from a Brexit memo caught on camera in Westminster.The handwritten notes, carried by an aide to Conservative MP Mark Field, included ""what's the model? Have your cake and eat it"" and ""unlikely"" in reference to the EU single market.They were photographed after Mr Field and his aide left a meeting with the Brexit department at 9 Downing Street.The government said the notes did not reflect its Brexit position.""These individual notes do not belong to a government official or a special adviser. They do not reflect the government's position in relation to Brexit negotiations,"" a spokesman said.Captured on long-lens camera by photographer Steve Back, they refer to difficulties the government faces after it begins the formal two-year process of EU withdrawal next year.""Difficult on article 50 implementation - Barnier wants to see what deal looks like first,"" they note in an apparent reference to the lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier.""Got to be done in parallel - 20 odd negotiations. Keep the two years. Won't provide more detail. We think it's unlikely we'll be offered single market,"" they also say.By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondentWith so much secrecy surrounding the government's strategy for Brexit, any potential insight into its thinking is seized upon.It is not known who Mark Field, a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, was meeting or if the page of scribbled notes being carried by his aide is definitely an account of talks at the department handling Britain's departure from the EU.If it is, it implies that it's ""unlikely"" the UK will remain in the single market, and that a transitional arrangement, immediately after Brexit, won't happen either.It says that a deal on manufacturing should be ""relatively straightforward"" but one on services will be ""harder"". In what appears to be a reference to the negotiating team the government will encounter in Brussels, the document says: ""Very French. Need fair process guaranteed."" The notes appear to suggest that a transitional arrangement - which would allow the UK continued access to the single market after Brexit while it negotiates a new trade deal - is also unlikely.""Transitional - loath to do it. Whitehall will hold onto it. We need to bring an end to negotiations,"" the paper reads.Mr Field is the vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and the MP for Cities of London and Westminster.It is not clear whom he and his aide had been meeting, or whether the notes reflected what they had been told or what they had planned to say.The government has refused to reveal details of its Brexit negotiation strategy in advance, saying it will not offer a ""running commentary"".Debate has focused on the level of access the UK could secure to the single market, and whether this would come at the price of greater immigration controls."
2016-11-28,UK-Polish links 'stronger' after Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38129171,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkTheresa May has insisted that Brexit will not stand in the way of the UK strengthening its ties with Poland.The prime minister signalled closer co-operation in defence, cyber security and enterprise during Downing Street talks with counterpart Beata Szydlo.She said she wanted an ""early"" resolution to negotiations over the future legal status of the 900,000 Polish citizens living in the UK.Ms Szydlo said this was a vital issue but understood reciprocity was needed.At a press conference in No 10 following the first-ever UK-Polish summit, Mrs May also confirmed the UK is to send 150 troops to Poland to help ""deter Russian aggression"" in Europe. They will be deployed in April close to the Polish border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.On the crucial issue of residency and employment rights, Ms Szydlo said Polish citizens in the UK needed certainty about their future after Brexit, telling reporters she hoped negotiations would yield ""the right balance"" for both the UK and the EU. ""From the point of view of Poland, let me reiterate that the most important thing (after Brexit) is the guarantees for the Polish citizens who are living and working in the United Kingdom,"" she said. ""Of course, these guarantees would need to be reciprocal.""Mrs May said she wanted to give Poles and other EU citizens living in the UK certainty but she said any agreement depended on Britons living elsewhere in Europe having equivalent assurances over their rights.During the visit to London, Mrs May and Ms Szydlo discussed Brexit and defence co-operation over a working lunch, while senior ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, met their counterparts at Lancaster House.The leaders and ministers then held formal talks in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street on issues ranging from trade and scientific co-operation to concerns about Moscow's military actions in Ukraine and Syria.Mrs May said she was determined that Brexit would not stand in the way of stronger economic and cultural ties between the two countries, announcing a series of joint initiatives on enterprise, innovation and cyber security and the ambition of a first-ever bilateral defence treaty between the two nations. Mrs May provided more details of the deployment next Spring of around 150 troops from the Light Dragoons, along with a number of armoured vehicles, to Orzysz in north-east Poland, close to the border with Kaliningrad, which houses Russia's Baltic fleet.The move, she said, was a response to Russian aggression on the ""eastern flank of Europe"".Mrs May said: ""Our ties with Poland are rooted deeply in our shared history. We will never forget the Polish pilots who braved the skies alongside us during World War Two, standing up for freedom and democracy in Europe, nor the valuable contribution made by so many Poles in our country today.""I am determined that Brexit will not weaken our relationship with Poland - rather it will serve as a catalyst to strengthen it.""Mrs May added that the summit ""marks the start of a new chapter in our relations and we will work even more closely together to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead"".""Today's meeting puts beyond doubt the common ground we share, the importance we attach to our bilateral relationship and the benefits it brings. We share a clear commitment to take our co-operation to the next level and to firmly establish the UK and Poland as resolute and strategic allies in Europe.""Mrs May has promised to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the legal process for Brexit, by the end of March.Formal negotiations cannot begin until then, but the UK prime minister is holding informal discussions with other EU leaders to find out their views.Ms Szydlo said the Brexit process would be ""interesting"" and negotiations must take place in a spirit of ""mutual trust"". Warsaw has raised concerns about the abuse of Poles in the UK following the Brexit referendum, with a rise in incidents of alleged hate crimes. Ms Szydlo said the incidents that occurred were ""very sad"" and thanked the UK authorities for their ""quick reaction"" ""We continue working together in order to make sure that the Polish community is safe,"" she added.

2016-11-28,Legal fight over single market membership,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38126899,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government is facing a legal battle over whether the UK stays inside the single market after it has left the EU, the BBC has learned.Lawyers say uncertainty over the UK's European Economic Area membership means ministers could be stopped from taking Britain out of the single market.They will argue the UK will not leave the EEA automatically when it leaves the EU and Parliament should decide.But the government said EEA membership ends when the UK leaves the EU.The single market allows the tariff-free movement of goods, services, money and people within the EU. The EEA, set up in the 1990s, extends those benefits to some non-EU members like Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Non-EU members are outside the Common Agricultural Policy and customs union, but get barrier-free trade with the single market in return for paying into some EU budgets and accepting the free movement of workers. If the courts back the legal challenge and give Parliament the final say over EEA membership, then MPs could vote to ensure that Britain stays in the single market until a long-term trading relationship with the EU has been agreed.The pro-single market think tank British Influence is writing to Brexit Secretary David Davis to inform him that it will seek a formal judicial review of the government's position.The group warned that if the government did not get a clear legal opinion it could potentially end up acting outside the law.All EU member states are in the European Economic Area and it had been assumed that when Britain leaves the EU it would automatically leave the EEA as well.But some lawyers argue that leaving the EEA would not be automatic and would happen only if Britain formally withdraws by triggering Article 127 of the EEA agreement. The legal question is focused on whether the UK is a member of the EEA in its own right or because it is a member of the EU.If MPs do get to decide on Article 127, they could potentially overcome the government's small majority and keep Britain inside the single market after Brexit. This would infuriate Brexiteers, but pro-EU campaigners say MPs would feel able to do this because people voted, they would argue, in the referendum to leave the EU and not the single market.Paradoxically, though, the legal uncertainty over EEA membership could also end up being good news for the government.If its negotiations with the EU went badly, and no deal looked likely, the UK could threaten to stay inside the EEA after Brexit. This would be politically hard for the government to sell as it would still involve EU workers moving freely within the UK. But it might be economically better than having to rely on World Trade Organisation rules which could involve high tariffs and barriers to trade. The ability to stay on in the single market means Britain could force the EU into accepting a transitional period for the UK to avoid an economic cliff edge. This would be a useful stick for UK negotiators to have up as there appears to be no mechanism for the EEA to force out one of its members. Professor George Yarrow, chairman of the Regulatory Policy Institute and emeritus professor at Hertford College, Oxford, said: ""There is no provision in the EEA Agreement for UK membership to lapse if the UK withdraws from the EU.  ""The only exit mechanism specified is Article 127, which would need to be triggered.""In other Brexit developments:At the the very least this latest challenge could mean a lengthy legal process - potentially via the European Court of Justice - that could delay Brexit negotiations.If the courts say Article 127 does need to be triggered, there is the question of whether an act of parliament would be needed for it to be authorised. The government is already fighting in the courts to stop MPs getting the final say over triggering the Article 50 process.Downing Street said the UK was only party to the EEA agreement through its EU membership and the government's position was clear that ""once we leave the EU we will automatically leave the EEA"". The PM's official spokeswoman said Theresa May was focused on delivering the will of the British people with regard to Brexit and preparing for the upcoming negotiations. Conservative MP and Brexiteer Dominic Raab said: ""Rather than coming up with new legal wheezes to try and frustrate the will of the people, these lawyers should be working with us to make a success of Brexit. ""The public have spoken; we should respect the result and get on with it, not try to find new hurdles that undermine the democratic process."""

2016-11-28,MPs urged to back free school meals plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38104241,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHead teachers are urging MPs to back a plan to ensure all children from poorer homes are automatically registered for free school meals.Parents often fail to apply for the meals for older pupils, says the National Association of Head Teachers. The NAHT wants MPs to add a clause on auto-registration to a bill being debated on Monday. Ministers said they did not believe that the proposed amendment was necessary ""at this stage"". But NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said it would ensure ""more children get the support they are entitled to"". Until 2014 families had to apply for their children to have free school meals, which were open only to the most disadvantaged groups. That year, the coalition government introduced universal free school meals for all children in reception, Year 1 and Year 2. As all children were eligible, some low-income families stopped informing schools about their circumstances. The knock-on effect was that once their children reached Year 3, they began to miss out, not only on free meals to which they were entitled, but on extra educational funding linked to being registered for the meals. The Department for Education website says older children could be eligible for free school meals if their parents receive any of a range of benefits that includes: But, according to the NAHT, some parents do not realise they need to apply for the free meals once their children reach Year 3 and the universal entitlement runs out. Some may have poor literacy or English language skills, while others live in chaotic households and are unable to find the organisational focus to fill in the forms.If adopted, an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill by four opposition MPs would automatically require councils to tell schools which of their pupils lived in low-income households and claimed benefits that indicated they should receive free meals.  Tony Draper, head of Water Hall Primary School in Bletchley near Milton Keynes, says registration rates for the meals there have dropped from 60% in 2014 to 28% this year. ""It's way too low for this area. This is one of the most deprived estates in the country.""Mr Draper argues that auto-registration would be a massive boost for families who are just about managing, a group the prime minister has said she wants to help. He says some parents are too proud to admit they are on benefits. ""Auto-registration would take this issue away. It would be easy for the government to do.""The Pupil Premium, a sum of money paid to schools to enhance the education of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, also depends on pupils being registered for free school meals. So if fewer parents apply for the meals, the school would get less Pupil Premium money and be less able to plan specialist help for children from low-income families, explained Mr Draper. If adopted, the new clause ""could deliver much-needed support and money for children and schools"", said Mr Hobby. The union says it would be an easy change and would show the government's ""true commitment to social mobility"". A government spokeswoman did not comment directly on the reasons why some parents failed to register their children for free school meals but said: ""The Department for Education already has a tool to enable parents to check for eligibility for free school meals, so we don't believe it's necessary for this amendment to be added to the bill at this stage."""
2016-11-28,Ed Balls leaves Strictly Come Dancing,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38123174,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkEd Balls has become the 10th celebrity to leave Strictly Come Dancing, saying he had had a ""wonderful time"" during his improbable run on the show. The former Labour shadow chancellor lost a dance-off to Judge Rinder star Robert Rinder on Sunday night.Balls had been the show's surprise star despite often being at the bottom of the leaderboard but this week, the public vote failed to save him.Meanwhile, controversial rapper Honey G was eliminated from ITV's X Factor. Balls and Rinder competed in the dance-off, both reprising their routines from Saturday night's show. The ex-politician and his professional partner Katya Jones danced their tango to (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones, while Rinder and his professional partner Oksana Platero performed their rumba to Lean On Me by Bill Withers. All four judges decided to save Rinder for another week, with both Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell citing ""technical"" ability.Bruno Tonioli added: ""Well, I have to choose the better dancers. Judge Rinder and Oksana.""Balls told Strictly co-presenter Tess Daly: ""If people watching have had half the fun I've had learning to dance with Katya then they must have had a complete blast because it's been such a fabulous thing. ""The judges, all the supporters, the make-up team, the wardrobe, in particular that band are the best in the world. It's just wonderful.""But his highest praise came for his partner and the voting public.  ""Above all the only reason we have been able to learn and to entertain is because of Katya, and it's her first series. She is going to go on to be a total dynamite, knock-out Strictly star, she is just the best there is. Absolutely amazing. She is utterly brilliant. ""And to all the people who have kept me in this long, thank you very much, I'm very grateful. I've had a wonderful time.""Saturday night's leaderboard was topped by two couples - Hollyoaks actor Danny Mac and partner Oti Mabuse, and singer Louise Redknapp and partner Kevin Clifton. Redknapp said Balls would be ""hugely missed"", adding: ""I think he was such a big personality around here and all of us really looked forward to watching Ed's numbers each week.""Mac said if people were asked about Strictly in 2016 ""they are going to say two words - Ed Balls"". Former Prime Minister David Cameron also paid tribute to Balls, with whom he clashed many times in the House of Commons, tweeting: ""Well done @edballs - we're very proud of you! #Strictly won't be the same without you.""Others who paid tribute to Balls on Twitter included his wife, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who tweeted: ""Always knew @edballs would love doing #strictly, never does anything by halves. Just glad so many other people have enjoyed it with him""And Nick Robinson, the former BBC political editor and presenter of Radio 4's Today programme, referenced the ongoing Brexit situation by tweeting: ""How's about a second referendum on Edxit? @edballs @SCD_UK #strictly""Mac and Mabuse had the highest score from the judges, with four 10s for their samba.But Redknapp won the show's first ever Cha Cha Challenge, which saw all six couples dance at the same time. The win added six points to her score and brought her and Clifton level with Mac and Mabuse for the top spot.The other two couples to make it through were Olympian Claudia Fragapane and her partner AJ Pritchard, and BBC Sport presenter Ore Oduba and his partner Joanne Clifton.   The five remaining couples will return to the dancefloor in the quarter-final on Saturday 3 December at 19:00 GMT, with the results show on Sunday 4 December at 19:20 on BBC One.Meanwhile, Honey G has been voted off X Factor after a sing-off with boy band 5 After Midnight.Considered by many to be the novelty act in this year's competition, Honey was eliminated after judges Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Simon Cowell all chose to save the boy band.Her performances have drawn criticism, with singer Lilly Allen describing her as a ""white lady that dresses up in Ali G, Goldie Lookin Chain kind of attire"" and rapper Professor Green saying she was ""taking the right mickey out of rap"". On Saturday, police were called to the set of the show after a man ran up behind Honey G and tried to touch her as the judges were giving her feedback.Honey, whose real name is Anna Georgette Gilford, said on Sunday that the show had been a ""completely life-changing experience"".

They must keep this information for one year and share it with various departments and organisations on demand.The government says it will help in the fight against terrorism.Its critics have named it the ""snoopers' charter"", and it is described in the petition as ""an absolute disgrace to both privacy and freedom"".The act was first proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May when she was Home Secretary and was approved by the House of Lords on 19 November.It is expected to become law by the end of 2016.Blogger Chris Yiu compiled a list of the 48 organisations and departments that will be able to access the browsing records of individuals without a warrant.They include various police, military, government and NHS departments as well as the Food Standards Agency, the Gambling Commission, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Health and Safety Executive.

There is no mandate for one particular Brexit option. The only question on the ballot paper was whether to leave, which we will, but how we execute our extraction must be debated.""The single market - which allows EU states to trade free of tariffs and other barriers - is central to the debate on what kind of deal the UK should seek when it leaves.EU leaders have said access to, or membership of, the single market is dependent on the UK continuing to accept the principle of free movement, while Downing Street says people voted for greater control over the UK's borders and says it will not compromise on immigration controls.Ministers have yet to set out in detail their negotiating aims, but say they want maximum possible access to the single market.Prime Minister Theresa May has also said the UK will not seek to replicate other countries' trading arrangements with the EU, saying she will be pressing for a ""bespoke"" deal.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said: ""The government has been clear that we want to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market - and let European businesses do the same here.""But we have also been clear that the UK should make its own decisions on controlling immigration and the authority of EU law should end.""It's not in the UK's interest to give a running commentary on our thinking that could undermine our negotiating position.""On Sunday, ex-minister and Vote Leave campaign chief Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I think when people voted to leave the European Union they voted to take back control of our money, our laws, trade deals and our borders.""That means that the single market, that is basically a bureaucratic web, we need to be out of.""In other Brexit news, 81 MPs and peers have signed a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk calling for a deal to protect the rights of both Britons living in other EU countries and EU nationals in the UK.The letter, co-ordinated by Conservative MP Michael Tomlinson, says people are not ""bargaining chips"" and calls for discussions to ""move forward quickly""."
2016-11-28,One prison suicide 'every three days',https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38126646,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkA record number of inmates have taken their own lives in prisons in England and Wales so far this year, a prison reform charity has said. The Howard League for Penal Reform said it knew of 102 suicides, the highest since its records began in 1978. The charity said cuts to staffing and budgets had ""created a toxic mix of violence, death and human misery"".The government has pledged 2,500 extra officers and special measures for vulnerable or mentally ill inmates. The previous highest toll recorded by the charity was 94 suicides in 2004. However, the overall prison population has increased by about 10% since then, meaning the suicide rate was actually slightly higher in 2004.Then, there was approximately one suicide for every 830 prisoners. So far in 2016, there has been one death for roughly every 840 prisoners.The Howard League released the figures as it published a joint report alongside Centre for Mental Health, another charity. The report said there had been a rise in violence in prisons at a time when inmates were spending up to 23 hours a day locked in their cells.Howard League chief executive Frances Crook said: ""The number of people dying by suicide in prison has reached epidemic proportions.""No one should be so desperate while in the care of the state that they take their own life, and yet every three days a family is told that a loved one has died behind bars.""Cutting staff and prison budgets while allowing the number of people behind bars to grow unchecked has created a toxic mix of violence, death and human misery.""The report called for the incentives and earned privileges scheme in prisons to be scrapped, saying it was having a ""detrimental impact"" on inmates' wellbeing. The scheme allows prisoners to earn benefits in exchange for behaving responsibly. But the report said it was leading to some prisoners having limits placed on family contact, physical activity and access to money and possessions.The prison service has come under the spotlight recently, with thousands of officers protesting over concerns about safety earlier this month. It came after a string of high-profile incidents including the escape of two inmates, who were later recaptured.This month former Justice Secretary Michael Gove warned that too many people were being sent to prison, while the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd suggested more criminals could be punished without being jailed.Earlier this month, Justice Secretary Liz Truss unveiled a White Paper detailing a £1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for more prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors.A government spokeswoman said mental health in custody was taken ""extremely seriously"" and there were ""a range of measures already in place to help support prisoners"".She added: ""But we recognise that more can be done. That is why have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers, allocated more funding for prison safety and have launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project to address the increase in self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in our prisons.""

The report wants farmers to be rewarded for: The Green Alliance research goes further, though, by calculating the balance between spending on flood prevention and flood repairs. It concludes that £613m is spent on the after-effects of flooding, whilst hard flood defences receive less than half that - £269m.The report is in line with current thinking promoting natural flood defences. The government announced last week that it would set aside £15m for solutions which help slow the flow of water off the uplands to prevent it rushing downstream. Environmentalists said it was not enough, but these innovative schemes are in their infancy and even their supporters agree that they need testing on a river catchment scale.What is more, Green Alliance said the principles of spending on land management need more fundamental review.Under current arrangements, subsidised farming methods can:MPs on the Commons Environment Committee recently suggested that decision-making over flooding should be taken away from the Environment Agency. Green Alliance wants flood managements and prevention given to regional-scale catchment boards.Angela Francis from Green Alliance said: “We are spending hundreds of millions of pounds of public money in ways that are perverse. “Just by allocating current funding more rationally the government could reduce the burden on the public purse, save vulnerable communities from the misery of flooding, and increase the health of our natural environment.”Patrick Begg, from the National Trust, said that Brexit created an opportunity to ""create a system that rewards and incentivises farmers and land managers"" to reduce the flow of flood waters through natural solutions.The National Farmers Union is happy for farmers to be paid to catch water on their land, but fears that farms grants overall will be cut when the UK leaves the Common Agricultural Policy. A spokesman for the environment department Defra has told the BBC it was ""committed"" to flood protection. “Natural flood management plays an important role in our strategy - that is why last week we announced a further £15m funding for these schemes,"" the spokesman said. “We’re spending a record £2.5bn on flood defences to better protect 300,000 more homes by 2021 and many of these projects are also already using natural flood management measures.”Follow Roger on Twitter at @rharribin."

2016-11-28,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-28,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-28,Farage's successor,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38062589,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPaul Nuttall has been elected leader of the UK Independence Party, replacing Nigel Farage. But what do we know about him?Paul Nuttall is angry with mainstream politicians who think they have a monopoly on ""truth"".UKIP's new leader, a substantial figure on the Leave side of the Brexit debate, argues that the millions of voters who have rejected the establishment view of life rightly feel cheated.Those who claim the rise of his party is part of a global movement towards ""post-truth politics"" get short shrift. Mr Nuttall promises instead a ""post-deceit"" age.A familiar figure on political programmes for several years, he will now get the chance to show what that means. And then there's the task of getting UKIP - riven by factional disputes in recent months - back into shape, having promoted himself as the ""unity candidate"".Becoming UKIP leader two days short of his 40th birthday, Mr Nuttall, a former history lecturer - and a schoolboy footballer for Tranmere - is a man in a hurry. He was born in Bootle, Merseyside, on 30 November 1976, part of a Catholic family, attending local state schools. At the age of 12 Mr Nuttall was in the Leppings Lane end for the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium in 1989, which turned into a disaster claiming the lives of 96 people. It was, he has since said, ""a day burnt permanently in my, and thousands of other minds"".After leaving school he studied sport science at North Lincolnshire College,  studied history at Edge Hill College and trained to be a teacher at the University of Central Lancashire.He worked part-time as a classroom assistant at St Winefride's Primary School, Bootle, while he took a master's degree in history from Liverpool Hope University. Mr Nuttall is said to specialise in the Edwardian era. After graduating he lectured at Liverpool Hope University from 2004 to 2006.But he was already interested in politics. In 2002, aged 25, he ran for the Conservatives in a council election in Bootle. He told the Daily Post: ""I was brought up in a staunch Labour community and never really thought about voting any other way.""I left home for a few years and coming back to Bootle made me fully appreciate the levels of decay and decline. Now I just want to give people a reasonable alternative.""In 2004, Mr Nuttall joined UKIP, then a minor party in terms of its share of the vote in Westminster elections.He became an MEP - the youngest of the party's representatives in Brussels - for North West England in 2009 and, a firm ally of Mr Farage, he served as his deputy from 2010 until this September.When Mr Farage quit the leadership following the summer's Brexit referendum, Mr Nuttall - immediately considered one of the favourites to succeed him - decided not to run, saying he too wanted his ""life back"". ""I have been at the forefront of the campaign to leave the European Union for a decade now,"" he said, ""and I believe I can step aside with my objective achieved and my head held high"".His decision came despite Welsh Assembly Member Neil Hamilton backing him, saying: ""I think the future of UKIP is to Hoover up the votes of disgruntled ex-Labour voters. Paul as an authentic Scouser from Liverpool is an authentic voice of northern working-class England.""Mr Farage's replacement as leader, Diane James, quit after just 18 days in the job and the vacancy reopening led Mr Nuttall to put himself forward. As several candidates pulled out he came, with the backing of much of UKIP's establishment, to be seen as the favourite.Since the Brexit vote, Mr Nuttall has emphasised the need for a ""grown-up"" negotiation with the EU. He has also stressed that UKIP is no longer a ""single-issue pressure group"", with its founding aim - of the UK leaving the EU - on the way to being achieved.Growing up in the Liverpool of the 1980s, where Labour's left-wing Militant faction was at one stage dominant, seems to have coloured Mr Nuttall's world view.In a blog post last year, he called for a war against ""cultural Marxists"", who ""have changed the way we speak and the way we think"", adding: ""They've made the downright nonsensical acceptable and common sense unacceptable or politically incorrect.""A global warming sceptic, in 2010, he said UKIP would ban former US Vice-President Al Gore's climate change film An Inconvenient Truth from schools, calling it a ""blatant piece of propaganda"".In 2015, he faced criticism after joking that ""perhaps we should throw [Scottish First Minister Nicola] Sturgeon in front of a hunt horse"" to commemorate the day of celebration for the life of leading Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. In the same year, in a speech to the European Parliament, he said the EU's migration policies were enabling a ""freedom of movement of jihad"".He recently aroused criticism when he said Russian President Vladimir Putin was, with his Middle East policy, ""generally getting it right in many areas"", although acknowledging him as ""pretty much a nasty man beyond that"".Mr Farage has made much of his friendship with US President-elect Donald Trump.Mr Nuttall was not part of the Farage squad that recently travelled to Trump Tower but he does agree on the link between Brexit and the US presidential result.""Neither the Brexit vote nor the Trump victory was down to emotion rather than truth,"" he has said. ""They were down to the people realising the truth that the establishment was not acting in their best interests.""He has said he would back a referendum on capital punishment, ""if enough thought that was justified"", for the killers of children. Following his victory, there will be more pressure to demonstrate to the public a fuller view of his personality, in the way Mr Farage has done.Mr Nuttall laughed off a potential embarrassment last year when, as UKIP's education spokesman, he was shown in the party's manifesto standing in front of photographically altered library shelves - with several titles being shown twice. He joked on Twitter: ""I just have two copies of every book.""He will need to keep this sense of humour as UKIP, following an alleged fight in the European Parliament and the resignation of several senior figures - including former leader Diane James and former leadership candidate Steven Woolfe, seeks to move on without Mr Farage at the helm.Mr Nuttall, who has spent time living and working in Barcelona, is credited with masterminding UKIP's strategy of targeting disillusioned Labour voters in parts of the North of England. ""I want to replace the Labour Party and make UKIP the patriotic voice of working people,"" he said in his leadership acceptance speech.When he announced his decision to stand, he said: ""I have huge support out there across the country, not only among people at the top of the party in Westminster and with the MPs, but also among the grassroots.""And I want to stand on the platform of being the unity candidate - UKIP needs to come together. I'm not going to be on here and gild the lily. ""UKIP at the moment is looking over the edge of a political cliff. It'll either step off or it will step back. And I want to be the candidate that will tell us to come back.""The work starts now."
2016-11-28,'Fire under the ice',https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38108758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHow can a man whose hobbies include motor-racing, mountaineering and the bullfight be so impassive, impeccable and grave?That is the central mystery behind France's possible president-to-be, Francois Fillon.Detractors say that behind the mask of taciturnity lies a retiring personality ill-suited for the task of head-of-state.Mr Fillon, they say, is one of nature's lieutenants, a born second-in-command, a would-be leader without the guts to lead.Far from it, reply his supporters.  If the former prime minister is reserved, they say, that is because he has a rich interior life - and personal convictions that do not need the reflected affirmation of the media machine. And his path to the top may have been slow. But along the journey he has acquired a wealth of experience. The bid for the presidency, they say, comes from a man finally ready to assume the responsibilities of the office.Mr Fillon's political career has certainly been a long one.It was in 1981, aged 27, that he was first elected as a member of parliament, becoming the National Assembly's youngest member.His party was the Gaullist RPR of Jacques Chirac. Gaullism features a strong centralised state with conservative and nationalist policies.Mr Fillon's parents, a history professor mother and lawyer father, were also Gaullists, and he was brought up in comfortable circumstances near the western city of Le Mans. He studied journalism and then law. In 1974 he met his future wife Penelope Clarke. She is Welsh and they have five children, the last born in 2001.  They live near Le Mans, in the Sarthe department which remains Fillon's powerbase.Mr Fillon's first ministerial post, higher education, came in 1993 under Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.  He went on to hold five other cabinet posts, before serving as prime minister for five years until 2012 under Nicolas Sarkozy.For nearly all of this time, Mr Fillon was identified with the movement known as ""social Gaullism"".His friend and mentor was the late Philippe Seguin, who believed in strong state intervention in the economy and society. Mr Fillon also shared Seguin's Euroscepticism, and in 1992 both men voted against the Maastricht Treaty that ushered in the euro.Later as social affairs minister under Jacques Chirac, Mr Fillon had the image of an honest dealer prepared to put in the hours during long negotiations with trade unions.All of which sits rather oddly, some would say, with  the policies of Francois Fillon the presidential candidate, which are avowedly those of a radical economic liberal.In speech after speech in recent weeks, Mr Fillon has spoken in cataclysmic terms of France's ""broken"" social model, and the need for drastic cuts in state spending.""Sometimes you need to tear the whole thing down,"" he says.For Gaspard Koenig, of the free-market think tank Generation Libre, the explanation is that since leaving office in 2012 Mr Fillon underwent ""a Damascene conversion"".  ""He spent the last three years travelling up and down the country. He came to see the exasperation of ordinary people and how they wanted more than anything to get the state off their backs,"" he says.Mr Fillon's ""virage liberal"" (liberal U-turn) is a bold strategy in a country where fans of Margaret Thatcher, as he says he is, are not exactly thick on the ground. And as his opponents seek to portray Mr Fillon as a dangerous right-winger, another weapon will also be to hand: his Catholicism.He is a practising Catholic. He is personally opposed to abortion, but says he would never seek to repeal the law. Nor would he seek to ban adoption by gay male couples - though he wants the law changed so that a child can trace its birth mother.For the left, these are signs of worrying ambiguity on matters that are central to a progressive society. The left-wing newspaper Liberation headlined last week on fears of a return of clerical power.But it is not just left-wingers who see a link between Mr Fillon's Catholicism, his character, and his policies.For Henri Guaino, a former Sarkozy adviser, Mr Fillon ""believes in redemption through pain, the idea that you need to suffer in order to be saved. He believes the country has lived too luxuriously for too long.""So now it needs to make sacrifices. It's like a purge.""The same Catholic conviction could explain Mr Fillon's famous taciturnity, a refusal to be ruffled, that can come across as either old-world courtesy or a cold reluctance to engage.And it might also shed light on one of the big questions over his career: why for five years as prime minister he suffered the constant humiliations inflicted by his boss, the man he came to loathe, Nicolas Sarkozy.But whoever seeks to caricature Mr Fillon as an emotionless masochist must accept that that is at best only part of the picture.This is a man who fell in love with motor-racing as a child when the Austin Healey team stayed in his village during the Le Mans 24-hour race.  He could have become a professional driver. He says he has ""always had a problem with authority"" and as a boy was briefly expelled from school for leading a demonstration against a teacher. He despises politicians who ""think of nothing but politics day and night: they are obsessed and unbalanced"".  Among his other hobbies are mountaineering and piloting drones.His friend and ally, former minister Roselyine Bachelot, admits the frigid exterior. But she says: ""Under the ice there is fire."""
2016-11-28,Next steps,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38105941,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkSince starting on Strictly Come Dancing, Ed Balls has undergone a remarkable transformation - from bland, failed politician to bona fide folk hero, an underdog who is aware of his own absurdity but tries his darnedest and desperately wants to shine.With his sweetly self-conscious dad dancing, garish fancy dress, health and safety-defying lifts and faintly obscene hip thrusts, he has made strangely compelling viewing, and viewers propelled him further into the competition than most other ""novelty"" contestants in Strictly history.So now he is out, one question looms - where on earth does his career go from here? He has achieved a unique if peculiar place in the nation's affections - even being described as a national treasure. Balls has successfully worn away his bland image, but has surely lost some political credibility in the process.Here are some ideas for Balls's next move. If the political world closes the door on the former shadow chancellor after his stint in sparkly suits, and if any alternative media career fails to take off, there will definitely be one career option open come next Christmas.He would surely make a wonderful Dick Whittington or Widow Twankey, and would be a panto producer's dream booking - a huge national star who doesn't take himself too seriously.He would also be following a familiar route - the year after her Strictly appearance, Ann Widdecombe reunited with Craig Revel Horwood for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at Dartford's Orchard Theatre.Before Strictly, Balls took part in a special Sport Relief edition of The Great British Bake Off and impressed with his baking skills by rustling up muffins, beef pie and a show-stopper cake shaped like a ski slope.Of course, there will be some vacancies on the Bake Off line-up when it moves from the BBC to Channel 4.But, in all honesty, it is hard to picture him filling the shoes of judge Mary Berry or hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, who have all opted not to stay with the show. If Bake Off doesn't want him, another offer this time next year will undoubtedly come from ITV for him to sample kangaroo testicles on the next series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!It was good enough for fellow ex-politician and ex-Strictly contestant Edwina Currie two years ago.But if he doesn't fancy that, there are enough other reality TV shows to keep him going for a while - he could follow George Galloway's footsteps on Celebrity Big Brother or Widdecombe again on shows such as Celebrity Antiques Road Trip and 24 Hours in the Past.Or he could follow the example of Michael Portillo and many other mid-career personalities and forge a career at the altogether classier end of factual TV by hosting genteel travel documentaries.Portillo has got trains stitched up, though, and most other forms of transport are already spoken for. So Balls may need to resort to pitching more unusual ideas like Up the Thames in a Pedalo, or Britain By Tandem, perhaps co-starring his wife and fellow Labour politician Yvette Cooper.There are other potential subject areas of course - Portillo (surely Balls's role model in this arena) has thrived with documentaries about subjects as varied as World War One, classified state secrets, classical music and capital punishment. A likely option is for Balls to become a regular contributor on political programmes such as The Daily Politics and (again, like Portillo) This Week.It would also be very little surprise if he ended up with a column in the Daily Mirror or New Statesman.Balls could always combine his political nous with his recent television experience by applying to be chairman of the BBC.There will be a vacancy - the corporation is currently chaired by Rona Fairhead, who is standing down early next year when the BBC Trust is replaced by a unitary board.It is a role that involves a lot of political wrangling, so Westminster expertise would be a definite bonus - former Conservative Chairman Lord Patten did the job from 2011-14.And his insight into one of the BBC's biggest shows would no doubt come in handy.Is it totally inconceivable?Given his recent record in public votes, and given the political shocks of the past 12 months, might Balls return as an MP at a by-election between now and the next general election in 2020, and might the Labour Party look for someone the public connects with (and has heard of) if another leadership contest should come to pass?And, if Brexit begins to unravel between now and the next election, might the great British public look for an alternative to the Conservative administration?Stranger things have happened.

But, then again, the argument goes, so was Woolworths once.After all, the Labour Party in Scotland was once an impregnable electoral colossus.Smashed, crushed and shrivelled, it isn't any more.""This is UKIP's time,"" Paul Nuttall said in his victory speech.Labour, he claimed, had ""ceased to speak the language of working people.""Cue a flurry of tweets from jittery Labour MPs pointing out Mr Nuttall had once advocated privatising the NHS.UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, buys into the Nuttall plan.The former Conservative said ""we have maxed out the market for Thatcherite ultras,"" a reference to UKIP's original tilt towards disaffected Tories.Matthew Goodwin, Professor of Politics at the University of Kent and the party's chief academic watcher, told the BBC there was ""potential for UKIP, if they can hang together"".That could be a big if.But there were, he said, ""lots of radical right parties like UKIP"" in Europe who were able to command 15-25% of the national vote even without an EU referendum.In those Labour areas UKIP is targeting, Prof Goodwin said, ""lots of voters are economically left wing, they want more redistribution, but culturally they are actually quite conservative. They like the things UKIP has been saying on immigration and on anti EU and anti Westminster platforms."" So, game on?Nigel Farage has promised he won't be a ""back seat driver"". But history would hint he may just rattle around rather noisily in the boot.Paul Nuttall has promised his only theme will be unity. But history would hint political volcanoes that have erupted before have the capacity to do so again.UKIP has pledged to ""replace the Labour Party."" But history would hint that won't be easy.Then again, 2016 has taught me it's not wise for political correspondents to be in the wild prediction business.And a party that started life in a dusty office in the London School of Economics just 25 years ago has already proved its ability to change the political weather.Now they are going to try to do it again."

In cafes and workplaces all over the UK, you will hear Italians talking about food and football, but also about Italy's pivotal 4 December referendum on constitutional reform.More Italians are believed to have moved to the UK than any other European country in 2015; 600,000 are now estimated by the Italian consulate to live in the UK. More Italians live in London than any other city in the world, except Buenos Aires.They may play a key role in Italy's vote, and that is why leading Italian politicians have been flying to the UK to try to win expat votes. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says the reforms he's proposing are the best way for Italy to kick-start its economy - by streamlining decision-making and cutting red tape and public spending.But his critics say the changes will give him too much power and are a diversion from more urgent problems, such as corruption, unemployment and poor economic growth. The stakes are high. Mr Renzi says he will step down as prime minister if he loses the referendum, prompting the anti-government Five-Star Movement to characterise the referendum as a vote of no-confidence in his premiership. It could become the Italian equivalent of David Cameron's gamble on the Brexit referendum.If the prime minister does lose, there could be calls for a general election, which his supporters warn could plunge Italy into dangerous instability. In previous votes, less than a third of Italians abroad used their vote - so politicians have been trying to get the vote out. 600,000Estimated population according to Italian consulate292,000  Officially registered by Italy as residents abroad 55% Increase in residents registered since January 2011 44% Aged between 18 and 40 Mr Renzi sent his minister for reforms, Maria Elena Boschi, to London along with another five politicians from the Yes campaign (##BastaUnSiUK). The No campaign (#IoDicoNo) is led by Italy's biggest opposition party, the Five-Star Movement. It flew over one of its senior representatives, Luigi Di Maio, along with three more speakers from the No campaign. At the heart of the referendum are proposals to rewrite a third of the Italian constitution and reduce the size and power of the second chamber of parliament. At the moment the two houses - the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies - are just about equal. The referendum proposals would cut the number of senators from 315 to 100 and strip the Senate of the right to hold votes of no-confidence in the government. Reformists say this would cut the cost of politics by €500m (£430m; $530m) a year and speed up lawmaking by ending decades of parliamentary ping pong.Date: Sunday 4 December, but Italians voting by postal ballot in the UK need to make sure ballots reach the Italian Consulate by 1 DecemberWho can vote? Italians resident in the UK and those temporarily thereReferendum text: Do you approve the text of the Constitutional Law on 'Provisions for exceeding the equal bicameralism, reducing the number of MPs, the containment of operating costs of the institutions, the suppression of the CNEL and the revision of Title V of Part II of the Constitution' approved by Parliament and published in the Official Gazette n° 88 of 15 April 2016?This wording is actually simpler than some previous referendums.Biggest campaign gaffe A Yes campaign mailout included a typo in the web address - www.bastausi.it instead of www.bastaunsi.it. No campaigners promptly bought the incorrect domain and linked it to their website.Giusy Balzano is a night worker in a fast food restaurant in central London. ""Our constitution is beautiful,"" she explains, ""so I will vote No in the referendum to protect it. Also, if No wins, Mr Renzi will go home and finally Italians will have new elections and then maybe things will change and I can go home."" Giusy has lived in London for a year and attended one of the events ""Diciamolo a tutti"" (Let's tell everyone) organised by the Five-Star movement.  Yes-campaign group ""AperiSì"" has been meeting weekly in London and eight other cities. They take their name from the Italian custom of ""Aperitivo"", a pre-dinner event popular among young people.  One of the London organisers, Gianluca Failla - a 30-year-old social worker originally from Palermo - believes Mr Renzi's reforms will improve politics in Italy.""I studied International Relations in London, and I had to face ridicule each time I spoke about my country. I don't want this reputation any more. We are a laughing stock,"" he complains. He also thinks a Yes vote would help him personally. ""It will be easier for Italy to approve laws to allow gay couples to adopt,"" he says. ""Politicians avoid dealing with controversial legislation by letting the two chambers ping pong the law between them to delay a decision. I hope that finally this law can pass and I will feel like I have the same rights other Italians do."" Make-up company employee Alessandra Ciarno, 33, is yet to decide how to vote. ""I would like to be more informed about the referendum before making a choice,"" she explains.She has been living in London for nine years and fears a Yes vote could be bad for Italians abroad as there will be fewer senators to represent them. Ms Ciarno also sees the wording of the referendum question as an issue. ""I believe many people will not understand what it means."""

What drives these ""Walter Mittys"" to invent fake tales of heroism?Maybe it starts down the pub. There's talk of the SAS, and you've read all the books. An exaggeration becomes an embellishment, and then a lie.People are impressed. You get carried away. Buy medals on eBay. Wear them to a Remembrance Day parade. Then you slip up. You get a detail wrong and someone notices. You're exposed as a fraud. A Walter Mitty.In military circles, the name of James Thurber's fictional fantasist is applied to the persistent band of hoaxers who, for whatever reason, boast of military records they haven't earned. Sometimes Walter Mitty is abbreviated to Walter, or just Walt.One well-publicised case involved Roger Day, who admitted he hadn't earned the 17 medals - including awards for serving in World War II, the Military Medal and SAS badges - that he wore at a 2009 parade in Warwickshire.In 2008, bus driver Jamie Barrett was spotted marching in Edinburgh with members of the Parachute Regiment who had served in the Falklands. He had bought his medals online. After he was exposed, Barrett said:  ""I'm basically a Walter Mitty type of person.""And last year, Oxford's town crier Anthony Church confessed to inventing a career in the armed forces. He had previously claimed he was a ""regimental sergeant major"" and had worn a Falklands medal.Most people would regard the concoction of fake tales of heroism as reprehensible.""It completely undermines genuine heroes,"" says Gareth Johnson, the MP for Dartford who introduced the proposed law - the Awards for Valour (Protection) Bill - that would make wearing unauthorised medals a criminal offence, punishable by prison or a £5,000 fine.""People who have served their country in genuinely dangerous environments, then someone comes along and pretends that they are their equal - that causes a lot of offence,"" he says. ""When people see veterans it's important that people have confidence their medals are legitimate.""Internet vigilante groups with names like the Walter Mitty Hunters Club are dedicated to uncovering and shaming them, and these exposes are regularly picked up and given extra publicity by an indignant tabloid press.But what actually motivates the Walter Mittys to concoct their often elaborate tales is not always obvious.In Day's case, a court was told he had started to make up stories to impress his new wife, who was 24 years his junior.Confronted after his exposure, Barrett's explanation for his behaviour was more prosaic: ""I had been collecting the medals and silliness got hold of me. I got a bit carried away, put the medals on and went. I didn't realise that it would upset other people.""One of the more spectacular cases of recent times involved Capt Sir Alan McIlwraith, CBE, DSO, MC, MiD - or, rather, plain Alan McIlwraith, a call-centre worker living on a Glasgow council estate who built up an elaborate fake persona as a highly decorated officer who had finished top of his class at Sandhurst and served in the Balkans.""The lie had just gone too deep, it's like a weed that invades your life. Once it's taken root, there's nothing you can do about it,"" McIlwraith, who was exposed as a fraud in 2006, told the Guardian. Some will have had no involvement with the armed forces whatsoever, Greenberg says. But others might embellish their own military service into something more impressive-sounding. Richard Lee claimed he had served with the Royal Marines' mountain troops when he set up the worldwide endurance competition, Spartan Race. In fact, it turned out he had enrolled in the Officer Training Corps but dropped out before qualifying.Just how many Walter Mittys there are isn't entirely clear.In evidence to the Commons Defence Committee, the Royal British Legion (RBL) said it in its experience ""instances of so-called 'Walter Mittys' appear to be rare"" while the The Royal Air Force Families Federation said the issue was ""not widespread"".However, 64% of 1,111 Naval Families Federation members surveyed over four days said they had personally encountered individuals wearing medals or insignia that had been awarded to someone else. Gareth Johnson says his own RBL branch has had to expel two members who concocted bogus military records.Neil Greenberg, professor of defence mental health at King's College London, also argues that the phenomenon is more widespread than you might expect.""I've seen more people who say they were at the Iranian embassy siege than were actually at the Iranian embassy siege,"" he says. Gareth Johnson says the UK is highly unusual in not already having legislation of the kind he proposes. The wearing of medals without authorisation was made illegal by Winston Churchill after World War One - but in 2006, when the new Armed Forces Act came into effect, this was effectively repealed. So although Roger Day pleaded guilty to falsely wearing medals in 2010, a community order imposed on him was scrapped after his lawyer noticed that this had stopped being an offence 11 days before the parade.Under the Fraud Act, anyone who uses medals for financial gain can be prosecuted - but if no such benefit can be proved, no offence has been committed. One man who did gain financially is Christopher Griffin, a bodyguard who falsely claimed to have been a British Army Captain for 11 years, who admitted two counts of fraud by false representation at Plymouth Magistrates Court last year.Neil Greenberg, who has assessed several military impostors, isn't convinced that stricter legislation will deter them.""It's often not fully conscious,"" he says.  They are typically fairly pathetic individuals, as he puts it, who are ""doing it to bolster their own self-esteem"". ""Their problems are greater than that they say they were in the SAS,"" he says. Many will have an ""abnormal or end-of-normal personality"", while a few will have serious mental health problems.Critics have warned that the bill before Parliament would end up targeting people who were mentally ill. Johnson says it would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether it was in the public interest to prosecute any individual accused of wearing medals they hadn't earned. He also says that people who wear medals won by relatives, to honour their memory, would not face prosecution.Johnson's proposed law has won the backing of ministers. ""I fully support this bill,"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says. ""Medals recognise our forces who risk their lives for our freedom. It's important their service is properly protected.""The Commons Defence Committee also backs the legislation. In its report on the proposed law, it concluded there is ""a tangible and identifiable harm created by military impostors"". Its chairman, Julian Lewis, said such ""contemptible fantasists"" need to be deterred.Even without the threat of prosecution, being unmasked as a Walter Mitty in the media or online can be devastating in its own right. The BBC contacted a number of men who had been unmasked as impostors. None was prepared to speak on the record, but several spoke of their deep shame and said they had contemplated suicide.Many will have no sympathy. But Greenberg says everyone should examine their own capacity for Walt-like behaviour.""Most people exaggerate,"" he says. ""There's an element of this in all of us.""

2016-11-28,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161129005915/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2016-11-29,'Limited evidence' for benefit sanctions,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38152401,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkBenefit sanctions leading to ""hardship, hunger and depression"" are being imposed on people despite ""limited evidence"" on how well they work, the National Audit Office says.The public spending watchdog also said use of the sanctions ""varies substantially"" between jobcentres.Sanctions can be imposed on people who fail to comply with conditions attached to the benefits they receive.The government said improvements had been made to the system.An estimated 400,000 sanctions were imposed against people on out-of-work benefits last year.They are used when people do not comply with conditions - like attending jobcentre appointments - and involve the payments being reduced or stopped.Critics say sanctions cause ""severe financial hardship"" and MPs have previously demanded an inquiry into how they are applied - but the Department for Work and Pensions says they are an important part of the benefits system.It says the deterrent effect of sanctions will encourage people to comply with their conditions.But the NAO said: ""The department has limited evidence on how people respond to the possibility of receiving a sanction, or how large this deterrent effect is in practice.""Use of sanctions, it said, is ""linked as much to management priorities and local staff discretion as it is to claimants' behaviour"".The NAO said use of sanctions ""varies substantially"" between the different providers that are in charge of running the government's welfare-to-work programme.Some providers make more than twice as many sanction referrals as other providers supporting similar people in the same area, it said.Sanctions, which have been used in their current form since 1996, vary in length, the NAO said, adding that they ""reduce support to people, sometimes leading to hardship, hunger and depression"".For example, a jobless recipient can lose £300 of benefits if they get a four-week sanction. It said the government did not track the costs and benefits of sanctions, but spent an estimated £30-£50m a year applying them and about £200m monitoring conditions attached to benefits.Last year it estimated it withheld £132m in benefits.It said the DWP had taken steps to reduce the number of errors, but said the department ""needs to do more than react to problems"" and that it ""cannot conclude that the department is achieving value for money"".Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, said: ""Benefit sanctions punish some of the poorest people in the country. But despite the anxiety and misery they cause, it seems to be pot luck who gets sanctioned.""A DWP spokesman said: ""Sanctions are an important part of our benefits system and it is right that there is a system in place for tackling those few who do not fulfil their commitment to find work.""This report fails to recognise the improvements we have made to sanctions, particularly to help those who are vulnerable. The number of sanctions has fallen, and they are only ever used as a last resort after people fail to do what is asked of them in return for benefits."""
2016-11-29,'Justify executive pay' says government,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38138815,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has outlined its plans to make companies justify high levels of executive pay.Among the measures under consideration are pay ratios, which would show the gap in earnings between the chief executive and an average employee.Shareholders would be handed more powers to vote against bosses' pay, but the government will not force companies to put workers on boards.Prime Minister Theresa May has made tackling corporate excess a priority.Her Conservative government is ""unashamedly pro-business"", but big firms must earn and keep the public's trust, she said in the consultation plans.  Chief executives of FTSE 100 firms now have a median pay package of £4.3m, which is 140 times that of the average worker, according to the High Pay Centre. ""There may be some circumstances where that is defensible, but it should be for the boards of companies and executives to justify that,"" Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC.He said the UK was not alone in targeting pay ratios, with the US set to report them at the start of next year. However, businesses have warned it would be difficult to compare pay ratios across companies.   Former Business Secretary Vince Cable proposed them four years ago, but he dropped the idea because of what he called the ""Goldman-Waitrose issue"".By comparing pay gaps, Goldman Sachs will look like a more equitable company than John Lewis thanks to the very high pay of the average banker, which is around £400,000, explained BBC business editor Simon Jack.Simon Jack: The great pay crackdown?Other suggestions from the government include more frequent binding votes by shareholders on chief executive's pay packages.""The right thing is to give greater powers to shareholders to do their job in holding executives to account,"" Mr Clark said.The proposals form part of the government's Green Paper on corporate governance reform, which aims to increase public trust in business.The paper also includes measures on: Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to stop an ""irresponsible minority"" of private firms acting badly and ensure ""everybody plays by the same rules"".The move follows widespread anger over the collapse of BHS with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a big pension deficit.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis said the plans could become known as the ""BHS law"" because they responded so closely to the retailer's demise.""But had the proposals outlined today by the secretary of state been in place six months ago, I'm not wholly convinced that we would have avoided the corporate governance scandals that have plagued the last summer,"" he told MPs.The proposals announced by Mr Clark include a bespoke code of practice for the largest private companies who would have to comply or explain why they had not in their annual report. Private firms will also be expected to report on diversity, greenhouse gas emissions and social and community issues.Every 30 years or so, the government has a crack at bringing businesses to heel - usually in the wake of a scandal.In the 1980s it was Asil Nadir's Polly Peck and the late Robert Maxwell who prompted a series of corporate governance reforms. Sports Direct and BHS are the poster children of this new crackdown and some of the measures contained in the Green Paper are designed with those miscreants in mind.Will today's proposals succeed in changing the culture and practice of a corporate world perceived by the prime minister and others to be working for the few rather than the many?The failure of BHS casts a long shadow over the corporate landscape and yet this Green Paper gives little emphasis on amplifying the voice of pension scheme members.Ultimately, the success or failure of this crackdown will depend on how much is voluntary and how much is mandated. Today's Green Paper and the comments of the business secretary suggest that the government wants to encourage rather than impose a new approach. That will be seen by most as a far cry from the fighting talk of Theresa May's early days.Read Simon's blog in fullMr Clark also said he hoped the Green Paper would give a ""stronger voice"" to workers.Non-executive directors or advisory panels could represent workers' interests in the boardroom, the consultation paper suggests.Last week, Mrs May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards, an idea that had caused unease among companies.She ruled out forcing firms to appoint employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI, saying there were ""other routes"" to providing worker representation on boards. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the prime minister should have the confidence to take on ""big business elites"" over the issue. ""Workers on boards is a policy that's tried, tested and proven in many other countries. And it will work for Britain too, helping us build a stronger and fairer economy,"" she said.The Institute of Directors welcomed the proposed changes to private firms.""The government is right to bring a new focus to the corporate governance of unlisted companies, which at the moment is a bit of black box - we don't know what's going on in there until something goes wrong,"" said head of corporate governance Oliver Parry."

2016-11-29,'Have cake and eat it' notes dismissed,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38134859,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has distanced itself from a page of Brexit notes caught on camera in Westminster.The handwritten notes, carried by an aide to Conservative MP Mark Field, included ""what's the model? Have your cake and eat it"" and ""unlikely"" in reference to the EU single market.They were photographed after Mr Field and his aide left a meeting with the Brexit department at 9 Downing Street.The government said the notes did not reflect its Brexit position.""These individual notes do not belong to a government official or a special adviser. They do not reflect the government's position in relation to Brexit negotiations,"" a spokesman said.The notes, held by Mr Field's chief of staff Julia Dockerill, were captured on a long-lens camera by photographer Steve Back.""Difficult on article 50 implementation - Barnier wants to see what deal looks like first,"" they note, in an apparent reference to the lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier.""Got to be done in parallel - 20 odd negotiations. Keep the two years. Won't provide more detail. We think it's unlikely we'll be offered single market,"" they also say. Among the reaction from other EU members, Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel said of the UK stance: ""They want to have their cake, eat it, and get a smile from the baker, but not the other things... there are European values which cannot be separated. No cherry-picking.""The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith says the government's response, playing down the picture's significance, underlines just how ""awkward"" it is, because it does seem to be of a view held ""within"" the Brexit department.""The real damage is that phrase 'what is the model? Have cake and eat it.' The damage is the way that will be read by other EU countries,"" he says.It is not known who Mr Field - a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and MP for the Cities of London and Westminster - was meeting, or if the page of scribbled notes being carried by his aide is definitely an account of talks at the department handling Britain's departure from the EU.The notes appear to suggest that a transitional arrangement - which would allow the UK continued access to the single market after Brexit while it negotiates a new trade deal - is also unlikely.""Transitional - loath to do it. Whitehall will hold onto it. We need to bring an end to negotiations,"" the paper reads.The picture is enough to give Downing Street indigestion. But as the last shenanigans over a memo suggested, unless and until Number 10 is willing to share more details of their plans, or at least be clearer about the broad answers to the questions, every scrap or information will be pored over by journalists and interested parties, eager, if not downright desperate, for more information. If there is a vacuum, others will fill it. Downing Street is well aware of this. And some of the Number 10 team don't think it's a sustainable situation. But in the absence of a traditionally functioning opposition, and look at today's polls which suggest a stonking lead for the Tories, this lack of information does not, at least, appear to be doing much wider harm.Read more from LauraThe document also says it is ""unlikely"" the UK will remain in the single market, and that a transitional arrangement, immediately after Brexit, will not happen either.It says a deal on manufacturing should be ""relatively straightforward"", but one on services will be ""harder"" to achieve.And in what appears to be a reference to the negotiating team the government will encounter in Brussels, the document says: ""Very French. Need fair process guaranteed."" The government has refused to reveal details of its Brexit negotiation strategy in advance, saying it will not offer a ""running commentary"".Debate has focused on the level of access the UK could secure to the single market, and whether this would come at the price of greater immigration controls.For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer called for the government ""to come clean, to end this unnecessary uncertainty and publish a clear plan for Brexit"".""These disclosures are significant because they suggest that the government is not even going to fight for the single market or customs union in the negotiations. If that is the case, there are huge implications for the economy, for businesses and for jobs in the UK,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: ""If this is a strategy it is incoherent. We can't have our cake and eat it and there is no certainty on the single market. This picture shows the government doesn't have a plan or even a clue."""

His pubs launched an advertising campaign attacking the European Commission and other organisations such as the IMF on their beer mats. Figures published on Tuesday largely cover registered individuals and campaign groups who spent between £10,000 and £250,000 during the referendum campaign.Details of expenditure by the official two lead campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - and the majority of campaigners which reported spending of more than £250,000 will be released next year. Mr Izzard, a longstanding Labour supporter who has said he would like to run for London Mayor one day, was a prominent figure during the campaign and its aftermath - addressing a number of pro-Remain rallies.It is not clear whether he funded his campaign himself or whether he relied on donations from others. In total, Remain supporters reporting expenditure under the £250,000 threshold spent £2,917m, compared with the £1,901m spent by those supporting Leave. Leading Remain supporters included telecoms firm Lebara, which spent £220,573, business lobby group London First which spent £101,655 and the City of London Corporation, £48,612. Others to support a Remain vote included the CWU trade union with £86,543, German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans spent £33,758 and Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of leading universities, £69,365.On the Leave side, prominent backers included the Grassroots Out movement, spending £219,215, the Freedom Association, £90,341 and Veterans for Britain spending £146,945.The largest single reported spend on either side in this category was the £676,016 attributed to Darren Grimes, who submitted his invoices early - the larger spending amounts do not have to be registered until just before Christmas.In August, it was reported that Vote Leave gave £625,000 to the fashion design student in the days before the EU referendum to persuade young voters to opt for Brexit. Mr Grimes is now head of digital for the Brexit Central website.The Conservative Party remained neutral in the referendum but the figures show the Conservative Group for Europe spent less than £10,000. The Labour Movement for Europe spent £11,309 while the Green Party spent £48,815 on a remain vote. The Electoral Commission said the figures were a vital part of ensuring ""transparency and accountability both in how campaigners obtained funds as well as how they spent them""."

Former Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable, who was MP for the neighbouring seat of Twickenham and Isleworth until last year, told the BBC on Sunday that Mr Goldsmith's lead over Ms Olney was ""narrowing"" and he expected the result to be ""very close"".Mr Goldsmith, who is standing as an independent, told BBC Breakfast that the by-election was a vote on his record as a MP since 2010, including his support for the UK leaving the EU, but primarily on his longstanding opposition to a new runway at Heathrow now backed by the government.  ""If I lose this by-election, Heathrow will win,"" he said. ""A vote for me is against Heathrow expansion"".With all the leading candidates opposing Heathrow expansion and with the constituency having voted clearly in favour of remaining in the EU in June's referendum, the Lib Dems have sought to turn Thursday's poll into a vote on the government's Brexit negotiating strategy and aims.Ms Olney told the BBC that, if elected, she would have a ""personal mandate"" to vote against triggering Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the EU - should Parliament get to decide on the issue.""It appears people want to send a very clear message [on Brexit],"" she said. ""People want better representation on this issue.""Labour candidate Christian Wolmar has also said he would oppose the start of official talks on the UK's separation from the EU - putting him at odds with many within his own party who argue the Leave referendum result must be respected. ""Brexit is bad for Britain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""We know that from the dodgy Nissan deal, we know that from the fact that some 30,000 civil servants are going to have to untangle it. It would be a complete vote into the unknown.""At the 2015 election the then Conservative Zac Goldsmith got 34,404 votes, the Lib Dems 11,389, Labour 7,296, the Green Party 3,548 and UKIP 2,464. Green co-leader Caroline Lucas has called for party supporters to back the Lib Dem candidate as the best way of ousting Mr Goldsmith - as part of attempts to form a broader electoral alliance among ""progressives"". But former London Assembly member Darren Johnson has criticised the decision not to field a candidate in the constituency.Voting takes place between 07:00 GMT and 22:00 on Thursday. The result is expected in the early hours of Friday. There will be a This Week by-election special on BBC One covering the result.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:"

Mr Nuttall was named leader on Monday, having secured 62.6% of support among party members.He also announced one of his defeated opponents - Suzanne Evans would become UKIP's co-deputy chairman, along with South West of England MEP William Dartmouth.Paul Oakden will remain UKIP chairman and East of England MEP Patrick O'Flynn is the leader's principal political adviser, while former leader Nigel Farage has been offered the party's honorary presidency.Mr Batten, an MEP for London, accused Prime Minister Theresa May of doing ""nothing"" since entering power in July to move Brexit along.He said UKIP would ""reject"" having to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which gets formal exit negotiations with the EU under way. He added: ""Rather, we will call for Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act (1972) immediately as the first step in the process. This will restore law-making supremacy to the UK Parliament and put the British government in the driving seat of negotiations, not the EU.""Mrs May has promised to trigger Article 50 by the end of next March, but Mr Batten said her strategy was to ""delay and delay the whole process in order to fudge it"".Accepting his fisheries brief, Mr Hookem, an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, said: ""Currently, the UK allows trawlers from across the EU to plunder £1.5bn of fish from our waters each year, and British boats have only 13% of the fishing quota in our seas. ""This plundering of our national wealth must stop. Brexit is our opportunity to reclaim our seas and revitalise an industry currently on its knees.""Mr Nuttall, an MEP since 2009, beat Suzanne Evans and John Rees-Evans in the UKIP leadership contest."

""You would tend to have an individual that is leading at that chapter level - a specialist that understands that policy area very well.""You will then have a level of deputies that will provide the co-ordination and oversight of the text that is being produced and then you will have a chief negotiator that sits at the top. It is a pyramid structure and you can imagine a free trade agreement team being 50 to 100 people.""As it looked to supplement its already ""experienced"" team, Mr Griffiths said the civil service's ""strong preference"" was to recruit internally - meaning training existing civil servants rather than recruiting negotiators from other countries.But he added: ""We have an important decision to make which is effectively do we buy or build. The focus of our recruitment to date has almost exclusively been from Whitehall. But what that puts is a huge weight in terms of up-skilling and training. ""We have a trade faculty that has been set up by the Foreign Office that is going to be playing a huge role.""Asked by SNP MP Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, whether the UK was simply replacing an experienced Brussels-based bureaucracy with a less experienced London-based one, Mr Griffiths said there was a danger trade negotiators were being seen as ""mythical creatures"".To be a negotiator, he said, people had to understand the policy areas at stake and to have the experience and skills to ""carry out a negotiation in a very complex multi-stakeholder environment"". ""We have done a lot of the latter in the civil service in the past but I think it would be a mistake to just look at the civil service,"" he added.""As we move into that open and detailed negotiation phase, we will certainly be looking to have posts that are open to the best and brightest in both the public and private sectors.""

2016-11-29,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions.

In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2016-11-29,Richmond Park by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37909442,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is in full swing in Richmond Park, south west London, where voters will elect their next MP on 1 December. Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-29,Memo matters,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38143123,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkQuick, quick, another memo! This time, another tribute to the hawk-like eyes and instinct for a story that Steve Back, the legendary Downing Street snapper otherwise known  @Politicalpictures, has revealed not what the government's policies are on how we leave the EU, but certainly, what ideas and plans are being discussed in political circles. The suggestions, themselves, are not really a surprise. The French are expected to drive the hardest bargain, staying in the single market while controlling immigration is difficult in the extreme, and yes, some members of the government do want to ""have their cake and eat it"".The picture is enough to give Downing Street indigestion. But as the last shenanigans over a memo suggested, unless and until Number 10 is willing to share more details of their plans, or at least be clearer about the broad answers to the questions, every scrap of information will be pored over by journalists and interested parties, eager, if not downright desperate, for more information. If there is a vacuum, others will fill it. Downing Street is well aware of this. And some of the Number 10 team don't think it's a sustainable situation. But in the absence of a traditionally functioning opposition - and look at today's polls which suggest a stonking lead for the Tories - this lack of information does not, at least, appear to be doing much wider harm. Jeremy Corbyn's performance at PMQs has improved. But even though the government is vulnerable in many areas, Labour is not showing much sign of being able to chip away at the Tories' support. So why shouldn't Theresa May then stay completely schtum until the very last minute? Maybe there won't be damage, not immediately, maybe not even in the medium term. But there are whispers among Theresa May's supporters and allies that she ought, as soon as possible, to be more explicit about what she wants to do. Taking your time to make decisions, to be thorough, can be a strength. But take too long and suspicions, even on her own side, could start to grow of indecision. And charges of dithering are a real attack on any politician's strength that could, in time, give way to accusations of political weakness. "

But, then again, the argument goes, so was Woolworths once.After all, the Labour Party in Scotland was once an impregnable electoral colossus.Smashed, crushed and shrivelled, it isn't any more.""This is UKIP's time,"" Paul Nuttall said in his victory speech.Labour, he claimed, had ""ceased to speak the language of working people.""Cue a flurry of tweets from jittery Labour MPs pointing out Mr Nuttall had once advocated privatising the NHS.UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, buys into the Nuttall plan.The former Conservative said ""we have maxed out the market for Thatcherite ultras,"" a reference to UKIP's original tilt towards disaffected Tories.Matthew Goodwin, Professor of Politics at the University of Kent and the party's chief academic watcher, told the BBC there was ""potential for UKIP, if they can hang together"".That could be a big if.But there were, he said, ""lots of radical right parties like UKIP"" in Europe who were able to command 15-25% of the national vote even without an EU referendum.In those Labour areas UKIP is targeting, Prof Goodwin said, ""lots of voters are economically left wing, they want more redistribution, but culturally they are actually quite conservative. They like the things UKIP has been saying on immigration and on anti EU and anti Westminster platforms."" So, game on?Nigel Farage has promised he won't be a ""back seat driver"". But history would hint he may just rattle around rather noisily in the boot.Paul Nuttall has promised his only theme will be unity. But history would hint political volcanoes that have erupted before have the capacity to do so again.UKIP has pledged to ""replace the Labour Party."" But history would hint that won't be easy.Then again, 2016 has taught me it's not wise for political correspondents to be in the wild prediction business.And a party that started life in a dusty office in the London School of Economics just 25 years ago has already proved its ability to change the political weather.Now they are going to try to do it again."
2016-11-29,Digital records,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38134560,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Investigatory Powers Bill will get royal assent on Tuesday. More than 130,000 people have signed a petition calling for it to be scrapped. Tim Berners-Lee has said it creates a ""security nightmare"".Edward Snowden has described it as the most extreme surveillance in the history of Western democracy. But soon records of every website and messaging service UK-based citizens visit from any device will be retained for a year by communications companies. So, all of those protests will have been in vain. The petition in particular comes much too late, having been started after the bill had passed through all of its parliamentary stages. The fact that it has attracted more than 100,000 signatures means that it will get debated in Parliament - but there seems little chance of ministers taking any more  notice than they did of the call for an exploration vessel to be named Boaty McBoatface.The question is why the bill sailed through with very little opposition,  apart from that of the Liberal Democrats, SNP and a few questions from peers. It seems that privacy campaigners, the internet service providers (ISPs) and the wider technology industry failed to get  politicians to share their concerns.Sir Tim Berners-Lee: Dark, dark daysThe inventor of the world wide web answered three questions about the new law:What is your view of this legislation now that it has passed?This snoopers charter has no place in a modern democracy - it undermines our fundamental rights online. The bulk collection of everyone's internet browsing data is disproportionate, creates a security nightmare for the ISPs who must store the data - and rides roughshod over our right to privacy. Meanwhile, the bulk hacking powers in the Bill risk making the internet less safe for everyone. You previously tweeted ""dark, dark days"" about the bill passing.  But early in November you told the Today Programme: ""I feel it's important that we strengthen the accountability provisions.""  Was that strong enough - and do you regret not shouting louder?Well, there's been sustained opposition to the Bill at almost every stage of its development. I spoke out about it strongly when it was first floated in May 2015, and as the Bill went through parliament, technology businesses united in opposition to it, civil society (including the Web Foundation) was strongly critical and a number of committees tasked with reviewing the Bill made sweeping criticisms. So yes, now that the Bill has passed, I am left wondering what more I could have done personally, but government does seem to have been determined to railroad the Bill through, despite opposition from many diverse quarters. Why do you think MPs didn't listen to opponents of the bill?This Bill has come at an unprecedented time. Brexit - and other global political developments - have taken up the bulk of MPs time and attention in the past 18 months. MPs were asked to review an incredibly complex Bill with over 500 pages of supporting documents in a tight timescale while other seismic political events were unfolding around them. The fact that most MPs are not technologists likely also played a role - they may simply not have understood just how intrusive the laws they were considering were. However, public outrage and legal challenges are building around the Bill, meaning the story isn't over yet. A petition to repeal the Bill has reached over 100,000 signatures in just a few days, meaning Parliament must consider debating it again. I strongly urge them to do so. Meanwhile, multiple legal challenges to the provisions around data retention and bulk hacking are making their way through the courts, and seem to have a good prospect of success, meaning the Bill may soon need to be amended. Perhaps MPs were distracted, first by Brexit, than by Donald Trump's victory. But it seems this was never an issue that filled their postbags and inboxes.  In the past, two of the most passionate campaigners against mass surveillance were the Conservative MP David Davis and Labour's Tom Watson. They joined forces two years ago to take the government to court over mass surveillance - but this time things were different.David Davis is now in the government as Brexit Secretary, while Tom Watson is Labour's deputy leader, and both swung behind their parties' positions on the bill.I talked to James Blessing, chairman of the Internet Service Providers Association, about why its campaign had failed. He told me that for years, opponents had in fact won, making successive governments abandon mass surveillance plans. ""This bill is a zombie, which has been rearing its head in one form or another since 2007. This time it's alive,"" he said.He explained that the ISPA had been a witness in front of three different select committees and found MPs generally pretty ignorant about the technology issues. What is inside the Investigatory Powers Act?The most contentious part of the forthcoming law is a requirement that communication providers keep a log of their customers net browsing behaviour for a year.This will involve ISPs keeping a record of what websites - but not specific web pages - and chat apps their customers made use of and when. Dozens of different bodies, ranging from the police to the Food Standards Agency, will be able to request access to this information without requiring a warrant.There has been concern that the system is open to abuse, as the requests will not be vetted by an independent body. Moreover, the database presents a tempting target for hackers.Much of the rest of the law aims to provide legal backing to cyber-operations already being carried out by the UK's security services.It also introduces a new ""double lock"" for the most intrusive types of surveillance, such as hacking a target's smartphone or PC to see the messages they are sending.Even if ministers have given approval for such an intercept warrant, a panel of judges will also have to approve the matter.The authorities must also obtain a senior judge's permission before accessing communications data to identify a journalist's source.And new criminal offences have been created to punish those that misuse the surveillance powers.""The internet presents new opportunities for terrorists and we must ensure we have the capabilities to confront this challenge,"" said Home Secretary Amber Rudd.""But it is also right that these powers are subject to strict safeguards and rigorous oversight.""Nevertheless, the committees had taken the campaigners' arguments on board, making 96 recommendations for changes to the legislation -  nearly all of which had been ignored. I put it to him that the reason why the campaigners had failed and MPs had felt able to vote the bill through was that the general public had bought the argument of the security agencies. People were more worried about the threat from terrorists and criminals than they were about any implications for their personal privacy.He conceded that was the case. ""The public will believe the simple version of the truth - 'If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear,'"" he said. ""And that will be true until it affects them."" What happens next? Well, the minority who do care about mass surveillance - and smarter criminals - will probably resort to using VPNs ( virtual private networks) to mask their internet activity.  The rest of the population will not notice anything - unless someone manages to find a way of hacking into what is going to be a very valuable data collection."
2016-11-29,'Fire under the ice',https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38108758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHow can a man whose hobbies include motor-racing, mountaineering and the bullfight be so impassive, impeccable and grave?That is the central mystery behind France's possible president-to-be, Francois Fillon.Detractors say that behind the mask of taciturnity lies a retiring personality ill-suited for the task of head-of-state.Mr Fillon, they say, is one of nature's lieutenants, a born second-in-command, a would-be leader without the guts to lead.Far from it, reply his supporters.  If the former prime minister is reserved, they say, that is because he has a rich interior life - and personal convictions that do not need the reflected affirmation of the media machine. And his path to the top may have been slow. But along the journey he has acquired a wealth of experience. The bid for the presidency, they say, comes from a man finally ready to assume the responsibilities of the office.Mr Fillon's political career has certainly been a long one.It was in 1981, aged 27, that he was first elected as a member of parliament, becoming the National Assembly's youngest member.His party was the Gaullist RPR of Jacques Chirac. Gaullism features a strong centralised state with conservative and nationalist policies.Mr Fillon's parents, a history professor mother and lawyer father, were also Gaullists, and he was brought up in comfortable circumstances near the western city of Le Mans. He studied journalism and then law. In 1974 he met his future wife Penelope Clarke. She is Welsh and they have five children, the last born in 2001.  They live near Le Mans, in the Sarthe department which remains Fillon's powerbase.Mr Fillon's first ministerial post, higher education, came in 1993 under Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.  He went on to hold five other cabinet posts, before serving as prime minister for five years until 2012 under Nicolas Sarkozy.For nearly all of this time, Mr Fillon was identified with the movement known as ""social Gaullism"".His friend and mentor was the late Philippe Seguin, who believed in strong state intervention in the economy and society. Mr Fillon also shared Seguin's Euroscepticism, and in 1992 both men voted against the Maastricht Treaty that ushered in the euro.Later as social affairs minister under Jacques Chirac, Mr Fillon had the image of an honest dealer prepared to put in the hours during long negotiations with trade unions.All of which sits rather oddly, some would say, with  the policies of Francois Fillon the presidential candidate, which are avowedly those of a radical economic liberal.In speech after speech in recent weeks, Mr Fillon has spoken in cataclysmic terms of France's ""broken"" social model, and the need for drastic cuts in state spending.""Sometimes you need to tear the whole thing down,"" he says.For Gaspard Koenig, of the free-market think tank Generation Libre, the explanation is that since leaving office in 2012 Mr Fillon underwent ""a Damascene conversion"".  ""He spent the last three years travelling up and down the country. He came to see the exasperation of ordinary people and how they wanted more than anything to get the state off their backs,"" he says.Mr Fillon's ""virage liberal"" (liberal U-turn) is a bold strategy in a country where fans of Margaret Thatcher, as he says he is, are not exactly thick on the ground. And as his opponents seek to portray Mr Fillon as a dangerous right-winger, another weapon will also be to hand: his Catholicism.He is a practising Catholic. He is personally opposed to abortion, but says he would never seek to repeal the law. Nor would he seek to ban adoption by gay male couples - though he wants the law changed so that a child can trace its birth mother.For the left, these are signs of worrying ambiguity on matters that are central to a progressive society. The left-wing newspaper Liberation headlined last week on fears of a return of clerical power.But it is not just left-wingers who see a link between Mr Fillon's Catholicism, his character, and his policies.For Henri Guaino, a former Sarkozy adviser, Mr Fillon ""believes in redemption through pain, the idea that you need to suffer in order to be saved. He believes the country has lived too luxuriously for too long.""So now it needs to make sacrifices. It's like a purge.""The same Catholic conviction could explain Mr Fillon's famous taciturnity, a refusal to be ruffled, that can come across as either old-world courtesy or a cold reluctance to engage.And it might also shed light on one of the big questions over his career: why for five years as prime minister he suffered the constant humiliations inflicted by his boss, the man he came to loathe, Nicolas Sarkozy.But whoever seeks to caricature Mr Fillon as an emotionless masochist must accept that that is at best only part of the picture.This is a man who fell in love with motor-racing as a child when the Austin Healey team stayed in his village during the Le Mans 24-hour race.  He could have become a professional driver. He says he has ""always had a problem with authority"" and as a boy was briefly expelled from school for leading a demonstration against a teacher. He despises politicians who ""think of nothing but politics day and night: they are obsessed and unbalanced"".  Among his other hobbies are mountaineering and piloting drones.His friend and ally, former minister Roselyine Bachelot, admits the frigid exterior. But she says: ""Under the ice there is fire."""
2016-11-29,Farage's successor,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38062589,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkPaul Nuttall has been elected leader of the UK Independence Party, replacing Nigel Farage. But what do we know about him?Paul Nuttall is angry with mainstream politicians who think they have a monopoly on ""truth"".UKIP's new leader, a substantial figure on the Leave side of the Brexit debate, argues that the millions of voters who have rejected the establishment view of life rightly feel cheated.Those who claim the rise of his party is part of a global movement towards ""post-truth politics"" get short shrift. Mr Nuttall promises instead a ""post-deceit"" age.A familiar figure on political programmes for several years, he will now get the chance to show what that means. And then there's the task of getting UKIP - riven by factional disputes in recent months - back into shape, having promoted himself as the ""unity candidate"".Becoming UKIP leader two days short of his 40th birthday, Mr Nuttall, a former history lecturer - and a schoolboy footballer for Tranmere - is a man in a hurry. He was born in Bootle, Merseyside, on 30 November 1976, part of a Catholic family, attending local state schools. At the age of 12 Mr Nuttall was in the Leppings Lane end for the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium in 1989, which turned into a disaster claiming the lives of 96 people. It was, he has since said, ""a day burnt permanently in my, and thousands of other minds"".After leaving school he studied sport science at North Lincolnshire College,  studied history at Edge Hill College and trained to be a teacher at the University of Central Lancashire.He worked part-time as a classroom assistant at St Winefride's Primary School, Bootle, while he took a master's degree in history from Liverpool Hope University. Mr Nuttall is said to specialise in the Edwardian era. After graduating he lectured at Liverpool Hope University from 2004 to 2006.But he was already interested in politics. In 2002, aged 25, he ran for the Conservatives in a council election in Bootle. He told the Daily Post: ""I was brought up in a staunch Labour community and never really thought about voting any other way.""I left home for a few years and coming back to Bootle made me fully appreciate the levels of decay and decline. Now I just want to give people a reasonable alternative.""In 2004, Mr Nuttall joined UKIP, then a minor party in terms of its share of the vote in Westminster elections.He became an MEP - the youngest of the party's representatives in Brussels - for North West England in 2009 and, a firm ally of Mr Farage, he served as his deputy from 2010 until this September.When Mr Farage quit the leadership following the summer's Brexit referendum, Mr Nuttall - immediately considered one of the favourites to succeed him - decided not to run, saying he too wanted his ""life back"". ""I have been at the forefront of the campaign to leave the European Union for a decade now,"" he said, ""and I believe I can step aside with my objective achieved and my head held high"".His decision came despite Welsh Assembly Member Neil Hamilton backing him, saying: ""I think the future of UKIP is to Hoover up the votes of disgruntled ex-Labour voters. Paul as an authentic Scouser from Liverpool is an authentic voice of northern working-class England.""Mr Farage's replacement as leader, Diane James, quit after just 18 days in the job and the vacancy reopening led Mr Nuttall to put himself forward. As several candidates pulled out he came, with the backing of much of UKIP's establishment, to be seen as the favourite.Since the Brexit vote, Mr Nuttall has emphasised the need for a ""grown-up"" negotiation with the EU. He has also stressed that UKIP is no longer a ""single-issue pressure group"", with its founding aim - of the UK leaving the EU - on the way to being achieved.Growing up in the Liverpool of the 1980s, where Labour's left-wing Militant faction was at one stage dominant, seems to have coloured Mr Nuttall's world view.In a blog post last year, he called for a war against ""cultural Marxists"", who ""have changed the way we speak and the way we think"", adding: ""They've made the downright nonsensical acceptable and common sense unacceptable or politically incorrect.""A global warming sceptic, in 2010, he said UKIP would ban former US Vice-President Al Gore's climate change film An Inconvenient Truth from schools, calling it a ""blatant piece of propaganda"".In 2015, he faced criticism after joking that ""perhaps we should throw [Scottish First Minister Nicola] Sturgeon in front of a hunt horse"" to commemorate the day of celebration for the life of leading Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. In the same year, in a speech to the European Parliament, he said the EU's migration policies were enabling a ""freedom of movement of jihad"".He recently aroused criticism when he said Russian President Vladimir Putin was, with his Middle East policy, ""generally getting it right in many areas"", although acknowledging him as ""pretty much a nasty man beyond that"".Mr Farage has made much of his friendship with US President-elect Donald Trump.Mr Nuttall was not part of the Farage squad that recently travelled to Trump Tower but he does agree on the link between Brexit and the US presidential result.""Neither the Brexit vote nor the Trump victory was down to emotion rather than truth,"" he has said. ""They were down to the people realising the truth that the establishment was not acting in their best interests.""He has said he would back a referendum on capital punishment, ""if enough thought that was justified"", for the killers of children. Following his victory, there will be more pressure to demonstrate to the public a fuller view of his personality, in the way Mr Farage has done.Mr Nuttall laughed off a potential embarrassment last year when, as UKIP's education spokesman, he was shown in the party's manifesto standing in front of photographically altered library shelves - with several titles being shown twice. He joked on Twitter: ""I just have two copies of every book.""He will need to keep this sense of humour as UKIP, following an alleged fight in the European Parliament and the resignation of several senior figures - including former leader Diane James and former leadership candidate Steven Woolfe, seeks to move on without Mr Farage at the helm.Mr Nuttall, who has spent time living and working in Barcelona, is credited with masterminding UKIP's strategy of targeting disillusioned Labour voters in parts of the North of England. ""I want to replace the Labour Party and make UKIP the patriotic voice of working people,"" he said in his leadership acceptance speech.When he announced his decision to stand, he said: ""I have huge support out there across the country, not only among people at the top of the party in Westminster and with the MPs, but also among the grassroots.""And I want to stand on the platform of being the unity candidate - UKIP needs to come together. I'm not going to be on here and gild the lily. ""UKIP at the moment is looking over the edge of a political cliff. It'll either step off or it will step back. And I want to be the candidate that will tell us to come back.""The work starts now."

2016-11-29,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130073910/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

It said the government did not track the costs and benefits of sanctions, but spent an estimated £30-£50m a year applying them and about £200m monitoring conditions attached to benefits.Last year it estimated it withheld £132m in benefits.It said the DWP had taken steps to reduce the number of errors, but said the department ""needs to do more than react to problems"" and that it ""cannot conclude that the department is achieving value for money"".Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, said: ""Benefit sanctions punish some of the poorest people in the country. But despite the anxiety and misery they cause, it seems to be pot luck who gets sanctioned.""A DWP spokesman said: ""Sanctions are an important part of our benefits system and it is right that there is a system in place for tackling those few who do not fulfil their commitment to find work.""This report fails to recognise the improvements we have made to sanctions, particularly to help those who are vulnerable. The number of sanctions has fallen, and they are only ever used as a last resort after people fail to do what is asked of them in return for benefits."""
2016-11-30,RBS biggest failure in bank stress test,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38135133,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkRBS is the worst prepared of the UK's biggest lenders to cope with another financial crisis, Bank of England (BoE) stress tests have found.The results forced RBS to devise plans to bolster its balance sheet by £2bn through cost cuts and shedding assets.Under the ""very severe"" tests, banks had to be able to handle a house price crash in the UK and a global recession.The BoE found Barclays and Standard Chartered also missed key hurdles but had already taken steps to cope.RBS, which is still 73% owned by the government after its bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, said it had ""agreed a revised capital plan... to improve its stress resilience"".It said the change came ""in light of the various challenges and uncertainties facing both the bank and the wider economy highlighted by the concurrent stress testing process"".RBS submitted the new plan to the Bank after running its own internal tests and finding its balance sheet would fall short.The bank said the test applied a hypothetical adverse scenario to the group's balance sheet as at 31 December 2015, and that it had taken a number of actions since then, including the ongoing run down of ""risk-weighted assets"".And it said it had continued its reduction in ""higher-risk credit portfolios"", and reached settlements with regard to various litigation cases and regulatory investigations.Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editorEight years on from the financial crisis and taxpayer-owned RBS is still short of the money it needs to survive another one. It came bottom of the class in the Bank of England's tests of financial strength and has been forced to beef up its finances. Barclays and Asian-focused Standard Chartered also performed poorly in the test, but the Bank said it was happy with their exiting plans to raise additional capital. These were the two weakest links in a system that overall has strengthened. And just as well. The Bank's Financial Stability Report has plenty of reasons for concern. The UK's reliance on foreign money to finance its trade deficit - the so-called ""kindness of strangers"" - is highlighted, along with the vulnerability of the UK's role in providing financial services to the European Union. Add to that the rapid increase in debt in China and the world looks like a dangerous place - not for the first time. RBS has been found vulnerable. The Bank said Barclays fell short of one hurdle, but it added that the bank's existing plans to safeguard its balance sheet were enough.Standard Chartered missed a key metric as well, although it was not asked to take any action.The Bank's Financial Policy Committee said in light of the findings and action taken by RBS, ""the banking system is in aggregate capitalised to support the real economy in a severe, broad and synchronised stress scenario"".And Bank of England governor Mark Carney, referring to the above trio of banks, said: ""There were three of the institutions who could see the direction of travel and took actions of their own accord."" Mr Carney added the tests showed the banks would still be able to lend to households and businesses, despite the ""very severe shock"". The annual stress test gauges the financial strength and resilience of the UK's seven major lenders - Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Santander, Standard Chartered and Nationwide Building Society.They were tested against a doomsday scenario which would see economic growth plunge to levels seen during the financial crisis of 2008.Stress test scenarioUnder the five-year scenario, UK house prices would dive 31% and unemployment rise to 9.5%, while China would suffer a recession and oil prices plunge to $20 a barrel.This is the third year of stress tests for UK banks.The 2014 stress test focused on risks to the UK household sector, while the 2015 ones focused more on global risks, particularly with a sharp contraction in growth in China. This year's tests incorporate a more severe global stress than either 2014 or 2015, and a domestic stress which is broadly as severe as the 2014 exercise.  The Bank says it ""reflects the desire of policymakers to use the stress-test framework to help set capital requirements and buffers for all stress-test participants each year"".Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland fell more than 4% before paring the losses. Barclays and Standard Chartered shares also saw modest falls."

Mathew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society for the Arts, was appointed last month to lead the review into the impact of ""disruptive"" businesses such as Uber and Deliveroo. New technology combined with new business models has led to a rise in workers doing short-term, casual work. Many are not eligible for the minimum wage, sickness or maternity pay.The review will address questions of job-security, pension, holiday and parental leave rights. It will also look at ""employer freedoms and obligations"".Mr Taylor will be joined by the entrepreneur, Greg Marsh, who founded onefinestay, a company which helps upmarket home-owners let their properties to visitors, Paul Broadbent chief executive of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and employment lawyer, Diane Nicol.The team will be talking to businesses and workers across the UK, including in Maidstone, Coventry and Glasgow. It will look into practices in manufacturing and rural economies as well as the ""gig"" economy.""The most important part of our process is getting out and about to talk to businesses and workers across Britain about their experiences of modern work,"" said Mr Taylor, who was formerly the head of the Number 10 policy unit under Labour leader, Tony Blair. His current role at the RSA think-tank is politically neutral. ""As well as making specific recommendations I hope the Review will promote a national conversation and explore how we can all contribute to work that provides opportunity, fairness and dignity,"" he said in a statement.Typically workers in the ""gig"" economy use mobile phone apps to identify customers requiring delivery services or small practical jobs. The Department for Business says 15% of those working in the UK's labour market are now self-employed. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is also set to launch a research project into the scale of the gig economy, which will examine the motivations of those engaging in ""gig"" work.""Helping us to understand what impact modern employment practices have on workers will inform our forthcoming industrial strategy and also help us ensure our labour market and wider economy works for everyone,"" said Business Minister Margot James.The government's Autumn Statement earlier this month indicated how the ""gig economy"" is also  beginning to affect budget revenues, as self-employment and casual work reduce the amount of tax being paid.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated that in 2020/21 it will cost the Treasury £3.5bn.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond indicated he would be looking for more effective ways to tax workers in the shifting labour environment.

2016-11-30,MPs to debate Blair Iraq investigation,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38142565,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe SNP is calling for an investigation into ""misleading information"" presented by Tony Blair in the build-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.It will lead a Commons debate on Wednesday, which it says is designed ""to prevent any repetition"" of a ""disastrous series of events"".It is not yet clear if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will be asking the party's MPs to oppose the motion.The Iraq War remains controversial in the party, which Mr Blair led.The Commons motion, to be introduced by SNP MP and former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says the Iraq inquiry ""provided substantial evidence of misleading information being presented by the then prime minister and others on the development of the then government's policy towards the invasion"" in 2003.The Iraq Inquiry, led by Sir John Chilcot, found Mr Blair had overstated the threat posed by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, had sent ill-prepared troops into battle and had ""wholly inadequate"" plans for the aftermath.The SNP says the inquiry's release of a note from Mr Blair to US President George W Bush in 2002, saying ""I'll be with you, whatever"", proves that he misled MPs about his intentions. The party's motion mentions a ""contrast between private correspondence to the United States government and public statements to Parliament and people and also in the presentation of intelligence information"".The motion also urges the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House ""to conduct a further specific examination of this contrast in public and private policy and of the presentation of intelligence"". It should then say what ""further action they consider necessary and appropriate to help prevent any repetition of this disastrous series of events"", it adds.There were reportedly angry scenes at the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday night over what to do in response to the SNP's motion.It is understood that the leadership, under Jeremy Corbyn - a prominent opponent of the war - wanted to impose a single-line whip to vote against the motion. This is the least stringent sanction on MPs, effectively meaning they could back the SNP's call without punishment.Some supporters of Mr Blair were opposed to this idea.It has since been reported that the shadow cabinet has rejected imposing a far stronger three-line whip, to the further annoyance of the Blair supporters.BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said there had been internal accusations of ""total confusion/shambles"" and that the offices or Mr Corbyn and Labour chief whip Nick Brown were engaged in a ""massive row"".MPs will debate and vote on the motion - which is also supported by Plaid Cymru, the Green Party's Caroline Lucas, Conservative Sir David Amess and Labour's Kate Hoey - on Wednesday afternoon.One Labour MP said the view at the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting had been ""very, very clear to have a three-line whip against the SNP"". They added that ""whether you were for or against the Iraq War is not what tomorrow is about. It's about whether [Mr Blair] lied, and Chilcot did not find he lied."" The US-led invasion of Iraq began in March 2003. The UK, which lost 179 military personnel in the conflict, ended its combat role in 2009. After the Chilcot report was published in July, Mr Blair, who led Labour to three general election victories, apologised for intelligence assessments having been ""wrong"".But he defended the decision to go to war, saying ""there were no lies. Parliament and cabinet were not misled. There was no secret commitment to war. Intelligence was not falsified and the decision was made in good faith""."
2016-11-30,'Justify executive pay' says government,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38138815,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has outlined its plans to make companies justify high levels of executive pay.Among the measures under consideration are pay ratios, which would show the gap in earnings between the chief executive and an average employee.Shareholders would be handed more powers to vote against bosses' pay, but the government will not force companies to put workers on boards.Prime Minister Theresa May has made tackling corporate excess a priority.Her Conservative government is ""unashamedly pro-business"", but big firms must earn and keep the public's trust, she said in the consultation plans.  Chief executives of FTSE 100 firms now have a median pay package of £4.3m, which is 140 times that of the average worker, according to the High Pay Centre. ""There may be some circumstances where that is defensible, but it should be for the boards of companies and executives to justify that,"" Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC.He said the UK was not alone in targeting pay ratios, with the US set to report them at the start of next year. However, businesses have warned it would be difficult to compare pay ratios across companies.   Former Business Secretary Vince Cable proposed them four years ago, but he dropped the idea because of what he called the ""Goldman-Waitrose issue"".By comparing pay gaps, Goldman Sachs will look like a more equitable company than John Lewis thanks to the very high pay of the average banker, which is around £400,000, explained BBC business editor Simon Jack.Simon Jack: The great pay crackdown?Other suggestions from the government include more frequent binding votes by shareholders on chief executive's pay packages.""The right thing is to give greater powers to shareholders to do their job in holding executives to account,"" Mr Clark said.The proposals form part of the government's Green Paper on corporate governance reform, which aims to increase public trust in business.The paper also includes measures on: Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to stop an ""irresponsible minority"" of private firms acting badly and ensure ""everybody plays by the same rules"".The move follows widespread anger over the collapse of BHS with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a big pension deficit.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis said the plans could become known as the ""BHS law"" because they responded so closely to the retailer's demise.""But had the proposals outlined today by the secretary of state been in place six months ago, I'm not wholly convinced that we would have avoided the corporate governance scandals that have plagued the last summer,"" he told MPs.The proposals announced by Mr Clark include a bespoke code of practice for the largest private companies who would have to comply or explain why they had not in their annual report. Private firms will also be expected to report on diversity, greenhouse gas emissions and social and community issues.Every 30 years or so, the government has a crack at bringing businesses to heel - usually in the wake of a scandal.In the 1980s it was Asil Nadir's Polly Peck and the late Robert Maxwell who prompted a series of corporate governance reforms. Sports Direct and BHS are the poster children of this new crackdown and some of the measures contained in the Green Paper are designed with those miscreants in mind.Will today's proposals succeed in changing the culture and practice of a corporate world perceived by the prime minister and others to be working for the few rather than the many?The failure of BHS casts a long shadow over the corporate landscape and yet this Green Paper gives little emphasis on amplifying the voice of pension scheme members.Ultimately, the success or failure of this crackdown will depend on how much is voluntary and how much is mandated. Today's Green Paper and the comments of the business secretary suggest that the government wants to encourage rather than impose a new approach. That will be seen by most as a far cry from the fighting talk of Theresa May's early days.Read Simon's blog in fullMr Clark also said he hoped the Green Paper would give a ""stronger voice"" to workers.Non-executive directors or advisory panels could represent workers' interests in the boardroom, the consultation paper suggests.Last week, Mrs May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards, an idea that had caused unease among companies.She ruled out forcing firms to appoint employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI, saying there were ""other routes"" to providing worker representation on boards. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the prime minister should have the confidence to take on ""big business elites"" over the issue. ""Workers on boards is a policy that's tried, tested and proven in many other countries. And it will work for Britain too, helping us build a stronger and fairer economy,"" she said.The Institute of Directors welcomed the proposed changes to private firms.""The government is right to bring a new focus to the corporate governance of unlisted companies, which at the moment is a bit of black box - we don't know what's going on in there until something goes wrong,"" said head of corporate governance Oliver Parry."

2016-11-30,'Have cake and eat it' notes dismissed,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38134859,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe government has distanced itself from a page of Brexit notes caught on camera in Westminster.The handwritten notes, carried by an aide to Conservative MP Mark Field, included ""what's the model? Have your cake and eat it"" and ""unlikely"" in reference to the EU single market.They were photographed after Mr Field and his aide left a meeting with the Brexit department at 9 Downing Street.The government said the notes did not reflect its Brexit position.""These individual notes do not belong to a government official or a special adviser. They do not reflect the government's position in relation to Brexit negotiations,"" a spokesman said.The notes, held by Mr Field's chief of staff Julia Dockerill, were captured on a long-lens camera by photographer Steve Back.""Difficult on article 50 implementation - Barnier wants to see what deal looks like first,"" they note, in an apparent reference to the lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier.""Got to be done in parallel - 20 odd negotiations. Keep the two years. Won't provide more detail. We think it's unlikely we'll be offered single market,"" they also say. Among the reaction from other EU members, Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel said of the UK stance: ""They want to have their cake, eat it, and get a smile from the baker, but not the other things... there are European values which cannot be separated. No cherry-picking.""The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith says the government's response, playing down the picture's significance, underlines just how ""awkward"" it is, because it does seem to be of a view held ""within"" the Brexit department.""The real damage is that phrase 'what is the model? Have cake and eat it.' The damage is the way that will be read by other EU countries,"" he says.It is not known who Mr Field - a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and MP for the Cities of London and Westminster - was meeting, or if the page of scribbled notes being carried by his aide is definitely an account of talks at the department handling Britain's departure from the EU.The notes appear to suggest that a transitional arrangement - which would allow the UK continued access to the single market after Brexit while it negotiates a new trade deal - is also unlikely.""Transitional - loath to do it. Whitehall will hold onto it. We need to bring an end to negotiations,"" the paper reads.The picture is enough to give Downing Street indigestion. But as the last shenanigans over a memo suggested, unless and until Number 10 is willing to share more details of their plans, or at least be clearer about the broad answers to the questions, every scrap or information will be pored over by journalists and interested parties, eager, if not downright desperate, for more information. If there is a vacuum, others will fill it. Downing Street is well aware of this. And some of the Number 10 team don't think it's a sustainable situation. But in the absence of a traditionally functioning opposition, and look at today's polls which suggest a stonking lead for the Tories, this lack of information does not, at least, appear to be doing much wider harm.Read more from LauraThe document also says it is ""unlikely"" the UK will remain in the single market, and that a transitional arrangement, immediately after Brexit, will not happen either.It says a deal on manufacturing should be ""relatively straightforward"", but one on services will be ""harder"" to achieve.And in what appears to be a reference to the negotiating team the government will encounter in Brussels, the document says: ""Very French. Need fair process guaranteed."" The government has refused to reveal details of its Brexit negotiation strategy in advance, saying it will not offer a ""running commentary"".Debate has focused on the level of access the UK could secure to the single market, and whether this would come at the price of greater immigration controls.For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer called for the government ""to come clean, to end this unnecessary uncertainty and publish a clear plan for Brexit"".""These disclosures are significant because they suggest that the government is not even going to fight for the single market or customs union in the negotiations. If that is the case, there are huge implications for the economy, for businesses and for jobs in the UK,"" he said.Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: ""If this is a strategy it is incoherent. We can't have our cake and eat it and there is no certainty on the single market. This picture shows the government doesn't have a plan or even a clue."""
2016-11-30,Comedian and pub chain among EU spenders,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38143120,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkComedian Eddie Izzard spent £36,229 on his campaign to keep the UK in the EU, official details of spending in this summer's referendum show.The Labour activist was among Remain supporters who spent less than £250,000 during the campaign, according to the Electoral Commission.Unite union spent £140,173 while the National Farmers Union spent £73,565.Leave backers included Sun publisher News Group Newspapers with £96,898 and pub chain JD Wetherspoon £94,586.Tim Martin, the boss of Wetherspoon, was one of the most outspoken supporters of Brexit in the business community. His pubs launched an advertising campaign attacking the European Commission and other organisations such as the IMF on their beer mats. Figures published on Tuesday largely cover registered individuals and campaign groups who spent between £10,000 and £250,000 during the referendum campaign.Details of expenditure by the official two lead campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe - and the majority of campaigners which reported spending of more than £250,000 will be released next year. Mr Izzard, a longstanding Labour supporter who has said he would like to run for London Mayor one day, was a prominent figure during the campaign and its aftermath - addressing a number of pro-Remain rallies.It is not clear whether he funded his campaign himself or whether he relied on donations from others. In total, Remain supporters reporting expenditure under the £250,000 threshold spent £2.9m, compared with the £1.9m spent by those supporting Leave. Leading Remain supporters included telecoms firm Lebara, which spent £220,573, business lobby group London First which spent £101,655 and the City of London Corporation, £48,612. Others to support a Remain vote included the CWU trade union with £86,543, German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans spent £33,758 and Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of leading universities, £69,365.On the Leave side, prominent backers included the Grassroots Out movement, spending £219,215, the Freedom Association, £90,341 and Veterans for Britain spending £146,945.The largest single reported spend on either side in this category was the £676,016 attributed to Darren Grimes, who submitted his invoices early - the larger spending amounts do not have to be registered until just before Christmas.In August, it was reported that Vote Leave gave £625,000 to the fashion design student in the days before the EU referendum to persuade young voters to opt for Brexit. Mr Grimes is now head of digital for the Brexit Central website.The Conservative Party remained neutral in the referendum but the figures show the Conservative Group for Europe spent less than £10,000. The Labour Movement for Europe spent £11,309 while the Green Party spent £48,815 on a remain vote. The Electoral Commission said the figures were a vital part of ensuring ""transparency and accountability both in how campaigners obtained funds as well as how they spent them""."
2016-11-30,Richmond Park campaign into final phase,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38143117,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkCampaigning is entering its final phase in the Richmond Park by-election ahead of Thursday's vote.The Lib Dems say there are ""closing the gap"" on sitting MP Zac Goldsmith, the former Tory who triggered the poll over his opposition to Heathrow expansion.Both the Lib Dem and Labour candidates say they will vote against Brexit in the event of a Parliamentary vote.Mr Goldsmith is backed by local Tory MPs and UKIP while the Green Party is backing the Lib Dems.With the Conservatives, UKIP and Green Party not fielding candidates, there are eight people standing in the election.Mr Goldsmith won the seat with a majority of more than 23,015 in last year's general election but the Lib Dems are targeting the constituency - after making big gains in the Witney by-election last month - which they held for 13 years until 2010.Leader Tim Farron and predecessor Nick Clegg are among those to have been out canvassing in the seat while many of the party's more than 100 peers are visiting the constituency - which encompasses Richmond, North Kingston and New Malden in south-west London - in the 48 hours before polls open. Former Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable, who was MP for the neighbouring seat of Twickenham and Isleworth until last year, told the BBC on Sunday that Mr Goldsmith's lead over Ms Olney was ""narrowing"" and he expected the result to be ""very close"".Mr Goldsmith, who is standing as an independent, told BBC Breakfast that the by-election was a vote on his record as a MP since 2010, including his support for the UK leaving the EU, but primarily on his longstanding opposition to a new runway at Heathrow now backed by the government.  ""If I lose this by-election, Heathrow will win,"" he said. ""A vote for me is against Heathrow expansion"".With all the leading candidates opposing Heathrow expansion and with the constituency having voted clearly in favour of remaining in the EU in June's referendum, the Lib Dems have sought to turn Thursday's poll into a vote on the government's Brexit negotiating strategy and aims.Ms Olney told the BBC that, if elected, she would have a ""personal mandate"" to vote against triggering Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the EU - should Parliament get to decide on the issue.""It appears people want to send a very clear message [on Brexit],"" she said. ""People want better representation on this issue.""Labour candidate Christian Wolmar has also said he would oppose the start of official talks on the UK's separation from the EU - putting him at odds with many within his own party who argue the Leave referendum result must be respected. ""Brexit is bad for Britain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""We know that from the dodgy Nissan deal, we know that from the fact that some 30,000 civil servants are going to have to untangle it. It would be a complete vote into the unknown.""At the 2015 election the then Conservative Zac Goldsmith got 34,404 votes, the Lib Dems 11,389, Labour 7,296, the Green Party 3,548 and UKIP 2,464. Green co-leader Caroline Lucas has called for party supporters to back the Lib Dem candidate as the best way of ousting Mr Goldsmith - as part of attempts to form a broader electoral alliance among ""progressives"". But former London Assembly member Darren Johnson has criticised the decision not to field a candidate in the constituency.Voting takes place between 07:00 GMT and 22:00 on Thursday. The result is expected in the early hours of Friday. There will be a This Week by-election special on BBC One covering the result.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:"

2016-11-30,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain has got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England is hoping its decision to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - will stave off recession and stimulate investment, with some economic indicators pointing to a downturn. Here is a detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations.Once negotiations officially begin, we will start to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration.The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time, which parts to keep, change or retain.A court challenge to Theresa May's right to trigger the Article 50 process without getting the backing of Parliament has been successful in the High Court. This means that there could be delays to starting the Article 50 process, but Downing Street is appealing to the Supreme Court with a hearing starting on 5 December. Downing Street says it intends to stick to its March timetable for the beginning of the two year exit talks. But if the appeal fails, Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested that the judgement implies they will need to bring forward an act of parliament - which would mean both MPs and the House of Lords giving the go-head for the talks to begin.Although it is generally believed that the go-ahead would ultimately be given - because of the EU referendum result - having to go through the full parliamentary process could prompt attempts to amend the legislation or add in caveats, such as the UK having to negotiate a deal which included staying the European single market after Brexit. Read a selection of questions answered on the court rulingTheresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.In very simplified terms, the starting positions are that the EU will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market (which allows tariff-free trade) if it continues to allow EU nationals the unchecked right to live and work in the UK. The UK says it wants controls ""on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe"". Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London. The challenge for the UK's Brexit talks will be to do enough to tackle immigration concerns while getting the best possible trade arrangements with the EU. Some Brexiteers, such as ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, say that as the UK does not want freedom of movement and the EU says that without it there is no single market membership, the UK should end ""uncertainty"" by pushing ahead with Brexit and not ""waste time"" trying to negotiate a special deal.These terms are increasingly being used as debate focuses on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.Ex-chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are among those to have warned against pursuing a ""hard"" option, while some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have put forward the opposite view.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.However the current UK inflation rate is 1% so it remains to be seen how big an effect currency fluctuations have in the longer term.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but it has seemed clear there will be a Commons vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that it looks like the deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said.Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Here's a guide to the contest, including who's running - and who's not.Because of the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who has represented the seat since 2010.He quit Parliament in protest at the government's decision to approve plans for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Mr Goldsmith, the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in May's London mayoral election, is trying to win his old seat back, but this time as an independent.The Liberal Democrats, who held the seat until 2010 and finished second there in last year's general election, are fielding Sarah Olney, an accountant who had already been pencilled in to fight the next general election.Labour's candidate is transport expert Christian Wolmar, while Fiona Syms is standing as an independent but promising to join the Conservatives if she wins.Here are all the candidates, in alphabetical order of surname:Despite his fierce criticism of the government over Heathrow, the Conservatives have decided not to field a candidate against Mr Goldsmith. Another party not standing is UKIP, saying it back Mr Goldsmith. The Green Party, meanwhile, is also not fielding a candidate, calling for a ""progressive alliance"" against the former Tory MP.Mr Goldsmith has said he wants to make the by-election a referendum on Heathrow. Ms Olney and Mr Wolmar also oppose Heathrow expansion, while Ms Syms is in favour.But the Lib Dems have declared their intention to make the by-election about Brexit, as well as the third runway, pointing to Mr Goldsmith's backing for the UK leaving the EU.On the banks of the Thames in south west London including the royal park itself, London's largest enclosed green space, and its environs.Generally an affluent area, Richmond Park has leafy streets and many open green spaces, including Kew Gardens and the London Wetland Centre. It includes parts of the boroughs of Richmond and Kingston and also has a Heathrow flight path over part of it, hence airport expansion being high on the agenda.Although the circumstances are different in each case, other MPs to have quit and recontested their seats include Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who won by-elections in 2014 after defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. In 2008, Conservative David Davis was unopposed by the main parties as he retained his seat after resigning over civil liberties.But in 1982, Bruce Douglas Mann was comfortably ousted by the Conservatives when he triggered a by-election after switching from Labour to the SDP."

Unlike Mr Phillips, Mr Goldsmith is standing for re-election, but as an independent rather than a Conservative.Labour's Sleaford hopeful Mr Clarke is a refuse collector, while Lib Dem Mr Pepper works for an optician and UKIP's Ms Ayling is a Lincolnshire County councillor. The Green Party is not fielding a candidate, but has given its backing to independent Sarah Stock, who is campaigning on a ""Save the NHS"" ticket.The full list of candidates for the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election is:"
2016-11-30,Memo matters,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38143123,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkQuick, quick, another memo! This time, another tribute to the hawk-like eyes and instinct for a story that Steve Back, the legendary Downing Street snapper otherwise known  @Politicalpictures, has revealed not what the government's policies are on how we leave the EU, but certainly, what ideas and plans are being discussed in political circles. The suggestions, themselves, are not really a surprise. The French are expected to drive the hardest bargain, staying in the single market while controlling immigration is difficult in the extreme, and yes, some members of the government do want to ""have their cake and eat it"".The picture is enough to give Downing Street indigestion. But as the last shenanigans over a memo suggested, unless and until Number 10 is willing to share more details of their plans, or at least be clearer about the broad answers to the questions, every scrap of information will be pored over by journalists and interested parties, eager, if not downright desperate, for more information. If there is a vacuum, others will fill it. Downing Street is well aware of this. And some of the Number 10 team don't think it's a sustainable situation. But in the absence of a traditionally functioning opposition - and look at today's polls which suggest a stonking lead for the Tories - this lack of information does not, at least, appear to be doing much wider harm. Jeremy Corbyn's performance at PMQs has improved. But even though the government is vulnerable in many areas, Labour is not showing much sign of being able to chip away at the Tories' support. So why shouldn't Theresa May then stay completely schtum until the very last minute? Maybe there won't be damage, not immediately, maybe not even in the medium term. But there are whispers among Theresa May's supporters and allies that she ought, as soon as possible, to be more explicit about what she wants to do. Taking your time to make decisions, to be thorough, can be a strength. But take too long and suspicions, even on her own side, could start to grow of indecision. And charges of dithering are a real attack on any politician's strength that could, in time, give way to accusations of political weakness. "

But, then again, the argument goes, so was Woolworths once.After all, the Labour Party in Scotland was once an impregnable electoral colossus.Smashed, crushed and shrivelled, it isn't any more.""This is UKIP's time,"" Paul Nuttall said in his victory speech.Labour, he claimed, had ""ceased to speak the language of working people.""Cue a flurry of tweets from jittery Labour MPs pointing out Mr Nuttall had once advocated privatising the NHS.UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, buys into the Nuttall plan.The former Conservative said ""we have maxed out the market for Thatcherite ultras,"" a reference to UKIP's original tilt towards disaffected Tories.Matthew Goodwin, Professor of Politics at the University of Kent and the party's chief academic watcher, told the BBC there was ""potential for UKIP, if they can hang together"".That could be a big if.But there were, he said, ""lots of radical right parties like UKIP"" in Europe who were able to command 15-25% of the national vote even without an EU referendum.In those Labour areas UKIP is targeting, Prof Goodwin said, ""lots of voters are economically left wing, they want more redistribution, but culturally they are actually quite conservative. They like the things UKIP has been saying on immigration and on anti EU and anti Westminster platforms."" So, game on?Nigel Farage has promised he won't be a ""back seat driver"". But history would hint he may just rattle around rather noisily in the boot.Paul Nuttall has promised his only theme will be unity. But history would hint political volcanoes that have erupted before have the capacity to do so again.UKIP has pledged to ""replace the Labour Party."" But history would hint that won't be easy.Then again, 2016 has taught me it's not wise for political correspondents to be in the wild prediction business.And a party that started life in a dusty office in the London School of Economics just 25 years ago has already proved its ability to change the political weather.Now they are going to try to do it again."
2016-11-30,Digital records,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38134560,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe Investigatory Powers Bill will get royal assent on Tuesday. More than 130,000 people have signed a petition calling for it to be scrapped. Tim Berners-Lee has said it creates a ""security nightmare"".Edward Snowden has described it as the most extreme surveillance in the history of Western democracy. But soon records of every website and messaging service UK-based citizens visit from any device will be retained for a year by communications companies. So, all of those protests will have been in vain. The petition in particular comes much too late, having been started after the bill had passed through all of its parliamentary stages. The fact that it has attracted more than 100,000 signatures means that it will get debated in Parliament - but there seems little chance of ministers taking any more  notice than they did of the call for an exploration vessel to be named Boaty McBoatface.The question is why the bill sailed through with very little opposition,  apart from that of the Liberal Democrats, SNP and a few questions from peers. It seems that privacy campaigners, the internet service providers (ISPs) and the wider technology industry failed to get  politicians to share their concerns.Sir Tim Berners-Lee: Dark, dark daysThe inventor of the world wide web answered three questions about the new law:What is your view of this legislation now that it has passed?This snoopers charter has no place in a modern democracy - it undermines our fundamental rights online. The bulk collection of everyone's internet browsing data is disproportionate, creates a security nightmare for the ISPs who must store the data - and rides roughshod over our right to privacy. Meanwhile, the bulk hacking powers in the Bill risk making the internet less safe for everyone. You previously tweeted ""dark, dark days"" about the bill passing.  But early in November you told the Today Programme: ""I feel it's important that we strengthen the accountability provisions.""  Was that strong enough - and do you regret not shouting louder?Well, there's been sustained opposition to the Bill at almost every stage of its development. I spoke out about it strongly when it was first floated in May 2015, and as the Bill went through parliament, technology businesses united in opposition to it, civil society (including the Web Foundation) was strongly critical and a number of committees tasked with reviewing the Bill made sweeping criticisms. So yes, now that the Bill has passed, I am left wondering what more I could have done personally, but government does seem to have been determined to railroad the Bill through, despite opposition from many diverse quarters. Why do you think MPs didn't listen to opponents of the bill?This Bill has come at an unprecedented time. Brexit - and other global political developments - have taken up the bulk of MPs time and attention in the past 18 months. MPs were asked to review an incredibly complex Bill with over 500 pages of supporting documents in a tight timescale while other seismic political events were unfolding around them. The fact that most MPs are not technologists likely also played a role - they may simply not have understood just how intrusive the laws they were considering were. However, public outrage and legal challenges are building around the Bill, meaning the story isn't over yet. A petition to repeal the Bill has reached over 100,000 signatures in just a few days, meaning Parliament must consider debating it again. I strongly urge them to do so. Meanwhile, multiple legal challenges to the provisions around data retention and bulk hacking are making their way through the courts, and seem to have a good prospect of success, meaning the Bill may soon need to be amended. Perhaps MPs were distracted, first by Brexit, than by Donald Trump's victory. But it seems this was never an issue that filled their postbags and inboxes.  In the past, two of the most passionate campaigners against mass surveillance were the Conservative MP David Davis and Labour's Tom Watson. They joined forces two years ago to take the government to court over mass surveillance - but this time things were different.David Davis is now in the government as Brexit Secretary, while Tom Watson is Labour's deputy leader, and both swung behind their parties' positions on the bill.I talked to James Blessing, chairman of the Internet Service Providers Association, about why its campaign had failed. He told me that for years, opponents had in fact won, making successive governments abandon mass surveillance plans. ""This bill is a zombie, which has been rearing its head in one form or another since 2007. This time it's alive,"" he said.He explained that the ISPA had been a witness in front of three different select committees and found MPs generally pretty ignorant about the technology issues. What is inside the Investigatory Powers Act?The most contentious part of the forthcoming law is a requirement that communication providers keep a log of their customers net browsing behaviour for a year.This will involve ISPs keeping a record of what websites - but not specific web pages - and chat apps their customers made use of and when. Dozens of different bodies, ranging from the police to the Food Standards Agency, will be able to request access to this information without requiring a warrant.There has been concern that the system is open to abuse, as the requests will not be vetted by an independent body. Moreover, the database presents a tempting target for hackers.Much of the rest of the law aims to provide legal backing to cyber-operations already being carried out by the UK's security services.It also introduces a new ""double lock"" for the most intrusive types of surveillance, such as hacking a target's smartphone or PC to see the messages they are sending.Even if ministers have given approval for such an intercept warrant, a panel of judges will also have to approve the matter.The authorities must also obtain a senior judge's permission before accessing communications data to identify a journalist's source.And new criminal offences have been created to punish those that misuse the surveillance powers.""The internet presents new opportunities for terrorists and we must ensure we have the capabilities to confront this challenge,"" said Home Secretary Amber Rudd.""But it is also right that these powers are subject to strict safeguards and rigorous oversight.""Nevertheless, the committees had taken the campaigners' arguments on board, making 96 recommendations for changes to the legislation -  nearly all of which had been ignored. I put it to him that the reason why the campaigners had failed and MPs had felt able to vote the bill through was that the general public had bought the argument of the security agencies. People were more worried about the threat from terrorists and criminals than they were about any implications for their personal privacy.He conceded that was the case. ""The public will believe the simple version of the truth - 'If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear,'"" he said. ""And that will be true until it affects them."" What happens next? Well, the minority who do care about mass surveillance - and smarter criminals - will probably resort to using VPNs ( virtual private networks) to mask their internet activity.  The rest of the population will not notice anything - unless someone manages to find a way of hacking into what is going to be a very valuable data collection."

(BBC interview, 24 November)""I see Brexit as an auspicious development. Similar things can happen in other countries. There is grumbling in France and also in Italy."" (Daily Sabah, 19 November)""Until the UK's exit is complete, Britain will certainly have to fulfil its commitments. Possibly there will be some commitments that last beyond the exit… even, in part, to 2030… Also, we cannot grant any generous rebates. There is no a la carte menu. There is only the whole menu or none. Without membership of the internal market, without acceptance of the four basic freedoms of the internal market, there can, of course, be no passporting, no free access for financial products or for financial actors."" (Financial Times, 18 November)European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt""We agreed… that the process needs to start as early as possible and finish in any case before the next European elections… The window for negotiations is more or less 14-15 months, let's be honest."" (Politico, following talks with UK Secretary of State for Brexit David Davis, 22 November) ""The freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and of people is the basic element of the European Union. We will certainly never accept whatever development where these four freedoms are put at risk."" (EU Observer, 22 November)""We don't want conflicts with Europe, but it is time to learn the lesson which comes from Brexit, and from the election of [Donald] Trump. If Europe doesn't change, it will run a big risk. There is widespread discontent. In the United States, in Europe, and also in Italy. And the EU is not seen as the solution, but as the problem. Europe cannot afford to remain immobile. It must put development, growth and investments, and jobs at the centre of its agenda."" (Interview with Corriere della Sera, 20 November)""Unfortunately I haven't heard anything new from David Davis today. For us it's clear - the four fundamental freedoms are not negotiable. Brexit means Brexit, so we're going to have to cut back on our relationships, it's not a cherry-picking situation at all."" (Financial Times, following talks with David Davis, 22 Nobember)""Portugal has had an important role over the years, because it is very involved in the EU... It has known the United Kingdom for a long time. It is not a relationship of today; it is an age-old relationship. And when people know each other for a long time, when countries know one another for a long time, it makes their relationship easier. The world changes, Europe changes, but our bilateral relations do not change."" (Jornal de Noticias, 16 November)""From our point of view, the softer Brexit is, the better. But at the same time, there cannot be any 'cherry picking'. A soft or hard Brexit sounds very black or white… But there is a big grey area in between and it is clear that's where we will end up."" (Reuters interview, 17 November) ""I'm not sure whether the UK knows what it wants. The split will be painful, but should it be we who suffer? The biggest loss for the EU would be if the UK comes out from the negotiations a winner."" (Bloomberg, 22 November)""Britain is perhaps our most important economic partner.

2016-11-30,'Fire under the ice',https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38108758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkHow can a man whose hobbies include motor-racing, mountaineering and the bullfight be so impassive, impeccable and grave?That is the central mystery behind France's possible president-to-be, Francois Fillon.Detractors say that behind the mask of taciturnity lies a retiring personality ill-suited for the task of head-of-state.Mr Fillon, they say, is one of nature's lieutenants, a born second-in-command, a would-be leader without the guts to lead.Far from it, reply his supporters.  If the former prime minister is reserved, they say, that is because he has a rich interior life - and personal convictions that do not need the reflected affirmation of the media machine. And his path to the top may have been slow. But along the journey he has acquired a wealth of experience. The bid for the presidency, they say, comes from a man finally ready to assume the responsibilities of the office.Mr Fillon's political career has certainly been a long one.It was in 1981, aged 27, that he was first elected as a member of parliament, becoming the National Assembly's youngest member.His party was the Gaullist RPR of Jacques Chirac. Gaullism features a strong centralised state with conservative and nationalist policies.Mr Fillon's parents, a history professor mother and lawyer father, were also Gaullists, and he was brought up in comfortable circumstances near the western city of Le Mans. He studied journalism and then law. In 1974 he met his future wife Penelope Clarke. She is Welsh and they have five children, the last born in 2001.  They live near Le Mans, in the Sarthe department which remains Fillon's powerbase.Mr Fillon's first ministerial post, higher education, came in 1993 under Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.  He went on to hold five other cabinet posts, before serving as prime minister for five years until 2012 under Nicolas Sarkozy.For nearly all of this time, Mr Fillon was identified with the movement known as ""social Gaullism"".His friend and mentor was the late Philippe Seguin, who believed in strong state intervention in the economy and society. Mr Fillon also shared Seguin's Euroscepticism, and in 1992 both men voted against the Maastricht Treaty that ushered in the euro.Later as social affairs minister under Jacques Chirac, Mr Fillon had the image of an honest dealer prepared to put in the hours during long negotiations with trade unions.All of which sits rather oddly, some would say, with  the policies of Francois Fillon the presidential candidate, which are avowedly those of a radical economic liberal.In speech after speech in recent weeks, Mr Fillon has spoken in cataclysmic terms of France's ""broken"" social model, and the need for drastic cuts in state spending.""Sometimes you need to tear the whole thing down,"" he says.For Gaspard Koenig, of the free-market think tank Generation Libre, the explanation is that since leaving office in 2012 Mr Fillon underwent ""a Damascene conversion"".  ""He spent the last three years travelling up and down the country. He came to see the exasperation of ordinary people and how they wanted more than anything to get the state off their backs,"" he says.Mr Fillon's ""virage liberal"" (liberal U-turn) is a bold strategy in a country where fans of Margaret Thatcher, as he says he is, are not exactly thick on the ground. And as his opponents seek to portray Mr Fillon as a dangerous right-winger, another weapon will also be to hand: his Catholicism.He is a practising Catholic. He is personally opposed to abortion, but says he would never seek to repeal the law. Nor would he seek to ban adoption by gay male couples - though he wants the law changed so that a child can trace its birth mother.For the left, these are signs of worrying ambiguity on matters that are central to a progressive society. The left-wing newspaper Liberation headlined last week on fears of a return of clerical power.But it is not just left-wingers who see a link between Mr Fillon's Catholicism, his character, and his policies.For Henri Guaino, a former Sarkozy adviser, Mr Fillon ""believes in redemption through pain, the idea that you need to suffer in order to be saved. He believes the country has lived too luxuriously for too long.""So now it needs to make sacrifices. It's like a purge.""The same Catholic conviction could explain Mr Fillon's famous taciturnity, a refusal to be ruffled, that can come across as either old-world courtesy or a cold reluctance to engage.And it might also shed light on one of the big questions over his career: why for five years as prime minister he suffered the constant humiliations inflicted by his boss, the man he came to loathe, Nicolas Sarkozy.But whoever seeks to caricature Mr Fillon as an emotionless masochist must accept that that is at best only part of the picture.This is a man who fell in love with motor-racing as a child when the Austin Healey team stayed in his village during the Le Mans 24-hour race.  He could have become a professional driver. He says he has ""always had a problem with authority"" and as a boy was briefly expelled from school for leading a demonstration against a teacher. He despises politicians who ""think of nothing but politics day and night: they are obsessed and unbalanced"".  Among his other hobbies are mountaineering and piloting drones.His friend and ally, former minister Roselyine Bachelot, admits the frigid exterior. But she says: ""Under the ice there is fire."""

2016-11-30,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20161130153646/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.
