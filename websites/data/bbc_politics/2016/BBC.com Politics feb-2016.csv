2016-02-01,Draft EU deal delivers reforms - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35467479,"A draft deal to meet David Cameron's EU reform demands - including new powers for national parliaments to block unwanted laws - will be unveiled later.European Council President Donald Tusk will publish the text at 11:00 GMT.Mr Cameron is aiming to convince the rest of the EU to sign up to his demands at a summit on February 18-19.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM will also have to win over his ""own side"", because many Tories fear the deal will not go far enough.If the UK can get an agreement at the February summit, Mr Cameron is expected to hold a referendum in June on whether Britain should remain in the EU.He will set further details of his renegotiation demands in a speech later, including a so-called ""red card"" system to make it easier for member states to band together to block unwanted EU laws.At the same time, Mr Tusk will publish the draft ""new settlement"" addressing the UK's concerns over sovereignty, competitiveness, immigration and protection for non-eurozone countries.But the document is not a done deal and Mr Tusk has warned of ""outstanding issues"" that still need to be resolved.These are thought to include objections to Mr Cameron's bid to curb the welfare entitlement of EU migrants, which is still being resisted by Central European countries, who claim it discriminates against their citizens.Mr Cameron had originally wanted to deny in-work benefits to all EU migrants until they have been in the UK for four years, saying this would reduce high levels of immigration to the UK. EU leaders rejected this idea but suggested an ""emergency brake"" which the UK could use for up to four years.The UK could use this to deny in-work benefits to EU migrants but it would have to prove public services were under excessive strain and would need the approval of other EU states.The proposal was to allow the UK to be able to impose the brake within three months of applying for it but Mr Cameron wants it triggered immediately after the EU referendum. He also says there should be no time limit on its use.Another of Mr Cameron's demands is for stronger powers for national parliaments to resist EU law.Under the current ""yellow card"" system, introduced in 2009, parliaments can get together to formally accuse the European Commission, the unelected body which produces EU laws and regulations, of overstepping its remit.  The commission can decide to maintain, amend or withdraw the proposal.However, it has been little used so far, with only a small number of EU laws attracting attention from a substantial number of parliaments.The treaty rules only oblige the commission to provide a written response to complaints, justifying why a set of proposals meet the bloc's rules on ""subsidiarity"".Downing Street sources said the new proposal - which would allow 55% of EU parliaments to club together to block measures - would strengthen this power and ensure the commission ""cannot just ignore the will of national parliamentarians"".Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott dismissed the ""red card"" proposal, saying: ""These gimmicks have been ignored by the EU before and will be ignored again as they will not be in the EU treaty.""UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: ""The idea we are being sold that a joint 'red card' is some sort of victory is frankly ludicrous.""Britain Stronger in Europe said that the ""red card"" proposal and the plans to curb benefits ""or equivalent concessions"" would ""represent a significant victory for the prime minister and underline that Britain is stronger in Europe"".

2016-02-01,Labour calls for Scots income tax rise,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35461968,"Labour has called for an immediate 1p increase in Scottish income tax rates.The party said the move would raise about £500m every year, which it said would be enough to avoid cuts to education and other local services.Holyrood will be given limited powers over income tax rates from April, with more flexible powers later due to be devolved under the Scotland Bill.The Scottish government has said it will not alter income tax rates until these greater powers come into force.But that will not be until next year at the earliest. Under the more limited powers, which have been devolved under the Scotland Act 2012, any changes in income tax rates would need to be replicated across all bands.The Scottish government has argued that this would mean the least well-off would be hit hardest by any increase. In his draft budget, which was unveiled in December, Finance Secretary John Swinney said he would be keeping income tax rates in Scotland the same as the rest of the UK in 2016/17.He said he hoped the greater flexibility in setting income tax rates offered by the Scotland Bill proposals would allow the the Scottish government to introduce a ""more progressive"" tax regime in the future.But Scottish Labour said its plan for a 1p rise in income tax across all bands from April would be offset by taxpayers earning less than £20,000 receiving a £100 annual boost to their income through a payment scheme. This £100 payment, which would be administered by councils, would be ""far in excess"" of the additional £20 which someone earning just above the minimum wage would pay in income tax over the course a year, the party said. Labour said someone on a salary of about £30,000 a year would pay less than £4 a week extra under its plan.But someone on the same £144,687 wage as the first minister would pay an extra £28 a week (£1,447 a year), it said.Read more hereScottish Labour's proposal would mean that income tax rates in Scotland would be higher than elsewhere in the UK.Leader Kezia Dugdale, said: ""Given the choice between using our powers or making cuts to our children's future, we choose to use our powers.""We will tear up this SNP budget that simply manages Tory cuts and instead use the power we have to set the Scottish rate of income tax 1p higher than the rate set by George Osborne. This will provide an extra half a billion pounds a year to invest in the future.""We don't do this because we want to use the powers for their own sake. We do it because there is no other alternative to cutting into our nation's future.""Mr Swinney's draft budget is due to be debated at Holyrood on Wednesday.SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said questions surrounded the figures being quoted by Scottish Labour.He told BBC Scotland: ""The Revenue and Customs say it's £475m. A £50m rebate would mean it's £425m.""There would be administration costs. Would councils have to pay the administration costs or are Labour going to pay that?""There's an HMRC charge. The fact is there are so many questions about this policy, I don't think it gets even off the starting block.""Last week, the Scottish Liberal Democrats also proposed increasing income tax rates by 1p to raise extra funds for schools.But the Scottish Conservatives have said that taxes in Scotland should be no higher than the rest of the UK - and lower when affordable.Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: ""It would hit every basic rate taxpayer in the pocket. It would damage jobs and hurt Scotland's economic revival. And it would add ridiculous complexity to our tax system - with the lowest paid being asked to go to their local council  to get a £100 cashback on a tax rise they never asked for. ""It simply isn't credible.""The Scottish Greens the ability to adjust the Scottish rate of income tax to make the tax take progressive was ""extremely limited"" and Labour's proposal would involve ""extra complexity and cost""."
2016-02-01,UKIP members to set candidate rankings,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-35470132,"UKIP members will decide the final rankings of regional candidates for May's assembly elections after a row within the party.Some local UKIP branches have raised concerns candidates from outside Wales would be imposed on them.UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said the decision to give party members the final say was ""a great victory"".Former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless will be among the names under consideration.There have been allegations of splits within the party's top ranks over the issue.In January, UKIP councillor Kevin Mahoney said he would quit the party if Mr Hamilton, Mr Reckless and Alexandra Phillips, UKIP's head of media in Wales, were selected on the regional lists. Opinion polls suggest UKIP is likely to win seats in the assembly for the first time at May's elections.Applications to be regional candidates are narrowed down to a shortlist. Party members then decide the order that those candidates are listed for the four seats in each of the assembly's five regions.Mr Gill told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's gone back to the grassroots, it's gone back to the membership. We have had a great victory here.""I think it's up to the members to decide for themselves who they want to represent UKIP in Wales.""UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""I have long argued that the UKIP members in Wales should get the final say on who represents our party in the Welsh assembly elections.""These elections in May are our best opportunity to make a breakthrough into UK domestic politics.""Analysis by Nick Servini, BBC Wales political editorThis is the first time Nathan Gill has spoken publicly about his ""big battle"" with the party's national executive committee over the selection of regional candidates.It's difficult to argue with a system that means local party members will have the final say over who tops the regional list.If Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are as unpopular with local party members as some have been saying, then presumably they won't be anywhere near the top of the list.Nathan Gill has been claiming victory. But bearing in mind this is a party that likes to take the moral high-ground in being above all a grassroots organisation, is it a battle it should have been having in the first place?Behind the scenes, this has been a damaging row internally for UKIP in Wales. The party will be hoping the decision will heal some of those divisions."
2016-02-01,'Plebgate' officer denies misconduct,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35473743,"A police officer thanked Andrew Mitchell for his ""candour"" at a meeting to discuss the ""plebgate"" row, but the following day told a radio station he had been evasive, a tribunal has heard. Det Sgt Stuart Hinton and two other Police Federation representatives met the Tory MP in October 2012, weeks after the Downing Street incident.The next day, he told the BBC the MP should resign for not fully explaining.The officer denies breaching police standards on honesty standards.The ""plebgate"" row centred on a 15-second confrontation in September 2012 between Mr Mitchell and PC Toby Rowland, in which - according to the Sun newspaper -  the then Conservative chief whip called the officer a ""pleb"" for his refusal to permit him to cycle through the main gates at Downing Street.Opening a gross misconduct case against Det Sgt Hinton, Aaron Rathmell said a recording of the meeting, which was played to the tribunal, showed the MP had admitted to swearing at a police officer during an exchange at the gates of Downing Street but denied calling him a ""pleb"". The recording also revealed that during the meeting Det Sgt Hinton praised Mr Mitchell for his ""candour"" after the MP told them what happened and said he was ""profoundly and deeply sorry"". Following the meeting, serving Warwickshire Police officer Det Sgt Hinton made comments, in an interview on BBC Radio Five Live on 13 October, about what was said at that meeting. The tribunal is considering whether these remarks were deliberately misleading.Mr Rathmell told the tribunal: ""Mr Hinton appeared on BBC radio and commented: ""He (Mr Mitchell) still won't say exactly what he did say, which suggests that the officer's account is more likely to be the accurate one."" Mr Rathmell said Det Sgt Hinton made these comments despite the fact he seemed satisfied with the answers he heard in the meeting, telling Mr Mitchell ""I appreciate your candour"" and later ""everybody can have a bad day"".Det Sgt Hinton and two colleagues from neighbouring forces had used the meeting ""as a springboard"" for a publicity campaign against government spending cuts, Mr Rathmell said. He added: ""The key controversy in this case surrounds exercising of judgment as to whether Sgt Hinton gave a misleading account regarding the meeting with Mr Mitchell, rather than facts or witnesses' statements being in dispute.""Mr Mitchell was forced to resign from the cabinet over the ""plebgate"" row but vowed to clear his name in the libel courts, launching an action against the Sun. But a judge ruled in 2014 that the MP probably had called PC Rowland a ""pleb"", and Mr Mitchell was ordered to pay damages as well as the Sun's legal costs.The misconduct panel is being held at the Warwickshire Police headquarters to hear an allegation the officer breached the force's professional standards of honesty, integrity and conduct.Det Sgt Hinton, who was secretary of the local Police Federation branch at the time, denies any wrongdoing.The hearing, which is scheduled for up to three days, continues."
2016-02-01,"Tackle cold homes, ministers told",https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35459447,"Bringing the UK's ageing homes into the 21st century should be a key infrastructure priority, ministers have been told.The government is consulting on a multi-billion pound plan for roads, rail, flood defences and energy.But opposition parties and institutions have told BBC News that home energy efficiency is equally important.Unless homes are insulated, they say the UK will miss targets to end fuel poverty and cut carbon emissions.The plan to make home energy efficiency a key infrastructure priority was proposed by the right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange (PX).BBC News found wide support, including from Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru, the CBI, TUC, the union GMB, the left-leaning think-tank IPPR, the all-party parliamentary group Green Alliance, the World Energy Council, the Institution of Civil Engineering and leading energy academics.The government declined to comment but its advisory body the National Infrastructure Commission said it would consider whether to take the idea further.PX argues that improving home efficiency creates many jobs; combats fuel poverty; reduces air pollution; minimises carbon emissions; cuts fuel imports; benefits the balance of payments; and reduces the need to build new power stations.""It's pretty much a no-brainer,"" said Richard Howard of PX. ""Bringing people's homes up to standard is incredibly good value for money. We don't typically think of housing as infrastructure like we think of roads and railways - but we've got to change the way we approach this: housing is critical infrastructure."" The CBI's Rhian Kelly told BBC News: ""Energy efficiency in homes and businesses is often at the back of the queue, so it's right that we see a sharper focus on making buildings more insulated, leading to significant savings for households and firms and important environmental benefits.""Professor Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said:  ""For too long, there has been an assumption that infrastructure includes energy supply and energy networks, whereas the type and quantity of energy we use (and might need in future) is heavily dependent on infrastructures that use energy such as buildings, vehicles and appliances.""Christophe Frei, General Secretary of the World Energy Council, said: ""This is such a no-brainer. It responds to energy efficiency, addressing fuel poverty, replacing new capacity requirement - and the financing is so much easier to do because the pay-back period is so short. But it needs the policies.""Among the organisations the BBC contacted, only the Institute for Economic Affairs did not back the plan, saying that using taxpayers' funds to improve housing was not a good use of public money.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin and Facebook https://www.facebook.com/roger.harrabin"
2016-02-01,Crime chief faced criticism in last job,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35466283,"New National Crime Agency head Lynne Owens was appointed amid concerns about her performance as chief constable of Surrey Police, the BBC has learned.Kevin Hurley, Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner, said he had considered seeking her dismissal before she took over the national policing role.Concerns about public protection and child safeguarding in Surrey were down to a ""failure of leadership"", he said.Mrs Owens said she underwent a ""lengthy and thorough"" NCA interview process. The Home Office said she was an ""exceptional"" policing leader.Last November, Mrs Owens, 47, saw off strong competition to be named director-general of the National Crime Agency - one of the most prestigious and highly paid roles in policing. The NCA has responsibility for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre - known as CEOP. But in the months leading up to her appointment, Mrs Owens's record on child protection had been brought into question by Mr Hurley.  Highly critical inspection reports of the force had led Mr Hurley to declare that he had lost confidence in Mrs Owens and was considering starting the formal process - known as Section 38 - that could have led to her dismissal.Criticisms included the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) finding failings in the way the Surrey force had handled the case of 14-year-old Breck Bednar, who was groomed online before being murdered.Mr Hurley had previously been a supporter of his chief constable, extending her contract in 2012 and writing to Home Secretary Theresa May in 2014 to say she had had an ""outstanding year"".But during the 12 months leading up to November 2015, all that had changed.  Emails and documents disclosed to BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act show that over this period, Mr Hurley's confidence in the chief constable's ability to deal with the problems ebbed away.The minutes of a public protection scrutiny meeting on 3 September reveal the PCC's concerns about the force's handling of rape, domestic abuse and female genital mutilation cases - as well as child protection.In September, Mr Hurley wrote a stinging 10-page letter to Mrs Owens saying he held her ""personally responsible"".He accused her of blaming others for the ""litany of failures"", claiming it was ""an example of moral cowardice"". He wrote: ""You have failed to act decisively or speedily to address many areas of concern in relation to public protection."" Mrs Owens has told the BBC these comments were ""ill-considered and inaccurate"".Mr Hurley delivered the letter to Mrs Owens at a meeting, during which she declared that she was applying for the NCA post.At the same meeting, Mr Hurley revealed he had been considering starting the formal process that could lead to Mrs Owens being dismissed or having to resign from the force.Mr Hurley then wrote to Sir Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, stating concerns that Surrey Police was ""failing vulnerable children, rape and domestic violence victims"" and asking for assistance. Mrs Owens issued a detailed 19-page rebuttal of the PCC's accusations, saying her 26-year police record was ""unblemished"" and that she had taken ""immediate and muscular"" action in response to child protection concerns.But in October, Mr Hurley wrote again to Sir Tom, saying: ""I have lost confidence in the chief constable's ability to lead the necessary cultural changes and cannot be sure that, under her command, the threat, risk and harm of public protection-related issues will be properly addressed.""Mr Hurley has said he was not asked about Mrs Owens's suitability for the NCA position, and only found out about her new job by a message posted by a journalist on social media.He said that had Mrs Owens not been appointed he would have started the formal dismissal process.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is a failure of leadership. The chief constable is the leader. She has let down the constables and sergeants, but more importantly she has let down our most vulnerable victims across the county."" The Inspectorate of Constabulary said it had briefed senior officials at the Home Office concerning the inspection work at Surrey, the ""nature of the correspondence"" from Mr Hurley and discussed the NCA appointment with them. However, it is understood that another inspectorate report, which is due to be published in the coming weeks, is expected to conclude that the force lacks understanding of serious and organised crime groups in Surrey and ""requires improvement"" in the way it deals with the problem.Mrs Owens said: ""I was selected to my current role by the home secretary after a lengthy and thorough process and am now focused on leading the National Crime Agency in its fight to cut serious and organised crime.""The Home Office said Mrs Owens was ""one of the exceptional policing leaders of her generation"".Officials pointed out that she went through a rigorous recruitment and selection process that included a ""testing"" panel interview. It said professional references and due diligence checks were also undertaken."
2016-02-01,'Catalogue of failures' hit Kids Company,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35455157,"The collapse of the Kids Company charity was a result of an ""extraordinary catalogue of failures"", a committee of MPs has said.The Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) also criticised the charity's trustees and the Charity Commission.Kids Company closed in August after questions over management and finances.Camila Batmanghelidjh, who founded the charity in 1996, said the report was ""a product of bias and rumour"".""The only place we got a rigorous fact-based investigation was with the police,"" she said, while former trustees condemned the report as  inaccurate, unbalanced and irresponsible.However, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, told the BBC the committee had been ""very careful with this report because we knew it was so controversial"".The inquiry had heard ""an extraordinary catalogue of failures of governance and control at every level - trustees, auditors, inspectors, regulators and government"", he said.The committee had heard positive accounts of valuable work by Kids Company, and of ""inspired and motivated employees"", which made the trustee board's failure to ensure the charity's sustainability ""all the more tragic"", he said.But he added that there had been ""a litany of allegations of inappropriate 'therapies', lavish spending and abuse of power within the organisation"".The charity supported deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol.By Lucy Manning, BBC News special correspondentThe report spares no one: Camila Batmanghelidjh, the trustees, government ministers, the auditors and regulators are all criticised.The heaviest criticism is for the trustees led by the BBC's Alan Yentob.He's described as someone who condoned excessive spending and lacked proper attention to his duties. The BBC is also accused of poor leadership for failing to take action against him when he tried to make suggestions about the BBC's reporting of Kids Company.The report also makes clear that even without the police investigation that triggered the charity's collapse, it would have been unlikely to survive due to the trustees' financial negligence and Ms Batmanghelidjh's reluctance to restructure the organisation she founded.Overall it makes for very sorry reading about a charity doing some good work let down by those who ran it, those who were supposed to oversee it and those who kept funding it without making proper checks.Mr Yentob and Ms Batmanghelidjh kept insisting there had been no financial mismanagement. This report makes clear there certainly was.Newsnight's Chris Cook pores over MPs' verdictWhile the committee's report said ultimate responsibility for the charity's closure was on its ""negligent"" trustees, the government and regulators must also learn lessons from its failure.  It was unacceptable that successive ministers appeared to release funds to the charity ""on the basis of little more than their relationship with a charismatic leader, small-scale studies and anecdotes"", it said. The committee says such an approach was an unjustifiable way to conduct government business and to handle public money. Ms Batmanghelidjh and Kids Company ""appeared to captivate some of the most senior political figures in the land, by the force of the chief executive's personality as much as by the spin and profile she generated for the charity"", the report added.The committee also highlighted ""extraordinary accounts of luxury items and holidays or spa days being lavished on 'Camila's kids', a favoured group of clients"". Conservative minister Oliver Letwin appeared before the committee in November to explain why he overruled civil service objections to pay a £3m grant to Kids Company just days before it collapsed.Speaking after the committee's report was issued, he said he believed it was ""the right thing to do to give this charity one last chance to restructure"".He said the government would be reviewing its grant-giving process ""in light of what we now know about Kids Company"".""By updating the process by which grants are awarded we will make sure the most stable, most effective charities receive taxpayer funds,"" he said.June 2015: Concerns raised by the Cabinet Office about Kids Company's request for a £3m government grant, but ministers approve the fundingJuly 2015: Ms Batmanghelidjh steps down, denying the charity has been mismanaged. The Met Police launches an investigation into allegations of failings and abuse linked to the charity.August 2015: Ministers say they want to recover the government grant. The charity closes. Ms Batmanghelidjh tells the BBC that Kids Company was subjected to a ""trial by media""October 2015: Ms Batmanghelidjh and Kids Company chairman Alan Yentob (at the time also a BBC executive) appear before the Commons Public Administration Committee and again deny the charity was badly run. The National Audit Office says the charity received at least £46m of public money despite repeated concerns over its managementJanuary 2016: The Met Police says it has concluded its investigation into allegations against the charity, and concluded there is no evidence of criminalityWhat went wrong?The report also said the charity's board of trustees ignored repeated warnings about the charity's financial health throughout its 19-year existence.It also failed to provide robust evidence of the charity's outcomes, or address increasing concerns about its programmes and behaviour of staff, it said.The trustees' negligent financial management was ultimately responsible for the charity's inability to survive, and its closure left many vulnerable beneficiaries without support, it concluded.The Metropolitan Police last week announced they had found no evidence of criminality after investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the charity. Kids Company had always denied the claims.And the PACAC also called on the Charity Commission to raise its profile so as to provide a more visible outlet for people to raise concerns with.""The commission projects too limited a public profile to provide much reassurance about charities and their regulation, and to attract complaints,"" the report said.  Camila's Kids Company: The Inside Story will be broadcast on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday 3 February, and on BBC Two in Wales. "
2016-02-01,May's surveillance bill 'confusing',https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/35455343,"The home secretary's plan to force internet service providers to store everyone's internet activity is vague and confusing, says a committee of MPs.Police and security services will be able to see names of sites visited in the past year without a warrant, under the draft Investigatory Powers Bill.The science and technology Committee says its requirements are confusing, and firms fear a rise in hacking.The Home Office said it would study the report's findings. When she announced the draft bill last year, Theresa May stressed that the authorities would not be able to see individual web pages visited, just basic data, such as domain names like bbc.co.uk or facebook.com.But tech firms have told MPs it may not be possible to separate out data in that way and the plans were not clear about was meant by ""internet connection records"".Committee chairman Nicola Blackwood said: ""There remain questions about the feasibility of collecting and storing internet connection records (ICRs), including concerns about ensuring security for the records from hackers. ""The bill was intended to provide clarity to the industry, but the current draft contains very broad and ambiguous definitions of ICRs, which are confusing communications providers. ""This must be put right for the bill to achieve its stated security goals.""Mrs May insisted in January that the Home Office had been clear about what it meant by ICRs and was working closely with the industry on the legislation.The science and technology committee also raised concerns about powers to allow spies to hack into suspects' smartphones or computers, known as ""equipment interference"".Ms Blackwood said the technique may ""occasionally be necessary"", but added: ""The tech industry has legitimate concerns about the reaction of their customers to the possibility that electronic devices could be hacked by the security services.""There are also concerns, expressed by Apple and other tech giants, that the bill will force them to adopt weaker encryption standards.Some products, such as the iPhone, allow people to communicate privately in a form that cannot be decoded, even by the company which makes the device, known as ""end-to-end encryption"".The bill would strengthen the power to force firms to give up decryption keys so that coded messages might be read.But Nicola Blackwood said the government had to do more to ""allay unfounded concerns that encryption will no longer be possible"". Service providers, such as BT and Sky, are concerned about the cost of storing internet records for 12 months, something they do not routinely do at the moment.The Home Office says the overall cost to the industry will be £174m over 10 years and ""reasonable costs"" will be reimbursed, but the industry has cast doubt on that estimate.The committee said the government should make an ""explicit commitment"" to pay the full costs incurred by compliance,"" to protect smaller firms hit with demands to store records.The Home Office said it was important companies did not suffer a commercial disadvantage and stressed there were no plans to change a long-standing position of reimbursing 100% of costs associated with data retention.Security Minister John Hayes said: ""We are mindful of the need for legislation to provide law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats to our country in the modern age, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements.""The government's final proposals will be set out in the spring."
2016-02-01,Black workers 'suffer 23% pay gap',https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35441833,"Black workers earn much less than similarly qualified white workers, at all levels of education, research suggests.Analysis of pay data by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests that the difference in average pay rates amounts to a gap of 23%.Black graduates earn on average £14.33 an hour, compared with £18.63 earned by white graduates, the TUC says.The average pay gap between black and white workers with A-levels is 14%.And at GCSE level the gap is 11%, the TUC says.The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Race still plays a huge role in determining pay.""The harsh reality is that at any level of education, black and Asian workers are getting paid less than their white counterparts.""The government cannot afford to ignore these figures and must now take genuine action to tackle pay discrimination."" The Runnymede Trust, a leading race equality think tank, has previously found that pay gaps are not due to the type of university attended, as they even extend to black workers with degrees from the most selective Russell Group of universities.In fact the TUC's analysis, based on the Labour Force Survey figures from 2014 and 2015, shows the pay gaps are widest for those with higher qualifications. ""This suggests that education alone will do little to address racial inequalities, and the need for interventions that directly challenge racial inequalities in the workplace,"" the TUC said.The trade union umbrella body is calling on the government to recognise the scale of the problem and to urgently develop a race equality strategy.As part of an anti-discrimination drive announced on Sunday, David Cameron said universities in England would be forced to disclose the proportion of ethnic minority applicants who get places.The prime minister said transparency would force top universities like Oxford to work harder to broaden their intake."
2016-02-01,Google deal 'not a glorious moment',https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35453772,"Google's £130m UK tax settlement was ""not a glorious moment"" for the government, Business Secretary Sajid Javid has acknowledged.The UK tax authorities' agreement with Google has fuelled a ""sense of injustice"" that big businesses receive preferential treatment, he said.His comments come a week after Chancellor George Osborne called the settlement a ""major success"". Google said it was in favour of reforms to make international tax clearer.However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned the fallout from the tax row had damaged Google's brand.""The reputational damage to Google, I think, is immense,"" he said, and suggested the ""saving they have made in tax is not worth the reputation damage they have had"".Mr McDonnell also repeated a call for Google and HMRC to release details of how the agreement was struck.He has published his tax return, showing he paid £14,253 in tax last year, and urged the chancellor to do the same, saying taxpayers filling in their own tax returns, which are due by midnight, would be ""feeling angry"" about the Google settlement.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid agreed that ""more needs to be done"" to ensure multinational companies pay the correct corporation tax.""I speak with thousands of companies small, medium-sized as well as, of course, large companies and there is a sense of injustice in what they see,"" he said.But the Google agreement could be seen as a ""success"" in so far as it would help to change the behaviour of other large companies, he said.Big businesses will see that HMRC ""will not give up, they will come after you if they feel you're not paying your fair share in taxes,"" he said. Earlier, a senior Google executive said the company felt the global tax system, which dates back to the 1920s, needed to be updated.Peter Barron, a senior Google communications director, told the Marr Show: ""We would like to see more simplicity and more clarity, not least because we would like to be seen to be paying the right amount."" Google still follows its motto of ""Don't be evil"" and tries to do the right thing, including on tax affairs, he said.UK sales account for around 10% of Google's global revenues, but the tech giant says UK profits, which is how corporation tax is calculated, are lower."
2016-02-01,Corbyn 'low payers' plan criticised,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35454109,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's proposal to penalise firms who do not pay the Living Wage has been described as ""unworkable"" by his business spokesman.Angela Eagle told The Sunday Times the plan to ban such firms from paying dividends was ""not a runner"".The idea was criticised as ""silly"" by Labour economic adviser David Blanchflower, in the New Statesman. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the criticisms would be taken on board in the party's policy review.Mr Corbyn floated the idea of banning profitable firms who ""depend on cheap labour for those profits"" from paying dividends to shareholders in a speech earlier this month.Ms Eagle, who heads Labour's National Policy Forum, said companies should be encouraged to act more fairly, but ""a ban on dividends is not the way to do it"".She told The Sunday Times: ""It is an interesting idea, but it does not actually work.""Asked to respond to her comments on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Mr McDonnell said ""that's why it's open for discussion"".The government is set to increase the current minimum wage, which rose to £6.70 an hour last year, to a £9 an hour for over 25s by the end of the decade.It will be rebranded as a National Living Wage, but Labour argues it will still be below the level full time workers need to afford a decent standard of living.Mr McDonnell said he planned to bring in a legally enforceable ""real living wage"" when Labour came to power.""But in the meantime, we want to campaign with shareholders so that they pressurise their companies to abide by a real living wage and I think there is an alliance to be built there,"" he added.Responding to criticism from David Blanchflower, who is a member of Labour's economic advisory panel, Mr McDonnell said ""we will listen to his advice and take it on board"".Mr Blanchflower said the new Labour leadership had to ""learn fast"" about the realities of capitalism and stop suggesting ""silly stuff"" such as the dividends ban.In a separate development, Lord Mandelson has accused Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters of declaring war on ""decent Labour party members"" who do not share their values.He denied there was a civil war going on in the Labour Party but said many of those who back Mr Corbyn are now wondering if he is up to the job.The former minister, who served in government under two Labour prime ministers said he thinks Jeremy Corbyn is ""unsupportable"" by the public, and is failing to put ""fear"" into the Conservatives.Speaking to BBC South West, he said: ""People sense that we just don't have credible policies and certainly not a leader they'd like to see as prime minister.""And certainly if we fight the election in 2020 as we are now then my fear would be that we would face a very disappointing result. ""But there's time to go between now and then. And time for the party to make up his mind what it wants to do.""He added: ""For Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters to turn around and say for people who disagree with them, that they are just Tories, that's not just insulting, that is actually very divisive, and a declaration of war by them on many decent Labour party members who share Labour party values.""

2016-02-01,Borders will disappear - McDonnell,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35455023,"Borders between countries will become ""irrelevant"" by the end of the century and the UK should prepare for that, John McDonnell has said.The shadow chancellor said a borderless world was inevitable and people were already ""ignoring"" existing borders.He also said the UK should be doing more to help the millions of migrants arriving in the European Union.Mr McDonnell gave a speech in 2013 in which he suggested borders could become a thing of the past.Asked to elaborate on this theory, by writer Rahil Gupta, Mr McDonnell said: ""Inevitably in this century we will have open borders. We are seeing it in Europe already.""The movement of peoples across the globe will mean that borders are almost going to become irrelevant by the end of this century so we should be preparing for that and explaining why people move.""In an interview with the BBC's Sunday Politics, he said borders will become increasingly difficult to maintain over the next 75 years and will eventually disappear, adding: ""We should be opening up the debate of how we handle that.""Mr McDonnell stressed the need to deal with the causes of mass migration: Poverty, conflict and climate change but added: ""We are seeing people ignoring borders already as they fly from Syria.""Current estimates suggest close to four million migrants will arrive in the EU between 2015 and 2017.Mr McDonnell said the UK should take its fair share of that number.He was unable to say how many people the UK should help but suggested the country should be a part of the EU's refugee quota scheme.""I think we should cooperate with others and carry the burden because we are seeing, as in the refugee crisis, the majority of Britons want us to rise to that and ensure that we assist others and that others aren't suffering and that we don't stand on one side while people suffer."""

2016-02-01,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen.

She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised.

2016-02-01,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech.

It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system.

The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system.

The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters.

Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending.

The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-01,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-01,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4 and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May wil be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-01,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron said he did not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand before serious discussions get under way. Through a series of speeches and newspaper articles, he has given an overview of his priorities but, and in November, he set down his objectives on paper for the first time in a letter to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council. His four key objectives are: The Conservatives want to free business from red tape and ""excessive interference"" from Brussels and to provide access to new markets through ""turbo charging"" free trade deals with America and Asia.They also want trade barriers in the services and digital sectors to be removed to create a truly single market as well as specific protections for the City of London. They support continued enlargement of the EU to new members but with new mechanisms in place to ""prevent vast migrations across the Continent"".The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules - amid pressure from trade unions to leave such protections intact. The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will."" it is widely expected to be held in June or July if a deal is reached at the EU summit in February.The Conservatives will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.David Cameron says that if necessary he would back a new law reasserting the power of the UK Parliament over the EU.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services. It is a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron's decision to seek the four year ban on some UK benefits for EU migrants was a way round it, but a number of EU countries - including Hungary and Poland - say they will not accept anything which discriminates against their nationals.This has led to reports that the idea of an ""emergency brake"" to limit numbers when there has been a surge of migrants, might be back on the agenda.In a speech in November 2014, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". But his spokesman reacted to the publication of Mr Cameron's negotiation objectives by warning that restrictions on benefits for new arrivals to the UK would be ""highly problematic"" as they affected the ""fundamental freedoms of our internal market"" and amounted to ""direct discrimination between EU citizens"".     The main sticking point has been opposition from countries including Hungary and Poland to the idea of the four year ban on claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU is that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals.However David Cameron has said he is willing to consider alternatives that have the same impact on migration flows, while his EU colleagues have also said they want to come up with a deal which achieves the UK's aims.Read more: Donald Tusk's letter responding to UK's renegotiation demandsMr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"" and he has no ""emotional attachment"" to the EU. Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, had urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum despite Mr Cameron warning in January 2015 that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU - if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.That position has now changed with Mr Cameron agreeing to allow cabinet ministers to campaign - in a personal capacity - on either side of the EU referendum campaign, once his renegotiation is over.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote.Referendum on the UK's future in the European UnionThe UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave. The vote is being proceeded by a process of negotiations in which the Conservative government is seeking to secure a new deal for the UK.

They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels. However the government will hope it will sound good in terms of wrestling back powers from Brussels to the UK - and to other EU countries.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumReferendum timeline: What will happen when?Q&A: What does Britain want from Europe?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-01,Canvassing the Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35466853,"Here are ten things about MPs' views about the UK's referendum on whether to stay in or leave the European Union, courtesy of research by the respected political academics Tim Bale, Philip Cowley and Anand Menon.They interviewed 129 MPs, a sample they say is closely representative of Parliament as a whole. So what did those MPs, speaking anonymously, tell them?1) Overwhelmingly, MPs think that the UK will vote to stay in the European Union - that was the response of seven out of 10 of those who spoke to the researchers.But how will MPs themselves vote?2) Half of respondents said they would be voting in favour of remaining in the EU. 11% said they would be voting to leave, but a third said that their views would depend on the terms of the prime minister's renegotiation with Brussels. Among Conservative MPs, 70% either said their vote would be based on the renegotiation, or they didn't know yet how they would vote.So, whilst some say this whole renegotiation malarky is pointless because people will vote on the bigger principle of the UK's place in the world, this research suggests something else: those who are undecided now might be persuadable when a large chunk of MPs (including the prime minister) finally say how they're going to vote, and this could prove decisive. 3) Still not convinced? Take a look at the views of Conservative MPs and Tory party activists. When you compare this study with research into the views of the Tory rank and file, it appears Conservative MPs are slightly more Eurosceptic than their grassroots, but both party members and those at Westminster overwhelmingly say ""lets wait and see what the prime minister gets"". So, on the face of it, the renegotiation does matter to them. Or, perhaps for some, they will want to be loyal to their party leader, and agree with whatever he concludes when the renegotiation is complete. David Cameron is highly likely to advocate staying in the EU - and will probably convince a healthy chunk of Conservative MPs and voters to support him.4) So, given I've claimed there is evidence to suggest this renegotiation does matter, do MPs think David Cameron will achieve very much? The short answer: no. Just 9% of MPs said they expected the negotiations to produce a great deal of change, and 21% expected a ""fair amount"" of change. The majority expected ""not very much"" or no change at all.Therefore, the renegotiation could prove both crucial and, in concrete terms, insubstantial in the view of many.5) How do MPs' views on the EU compare with those of the electorate? By comparing their research with the analysis of others, the academics conclude that Conservative MPs are, on balance, considerably more inclined than voters to believe the UK has not benefited from being a member of the EU. Labour MPs are even more out of line, but in the opposite direction.Tell me more, do I hear you say?6) OK, voters are sceptical about any supposed benefits to the UK of EU members throwing more of their lot in together and integrating, but are nowhere near as sceptical as some Conservative MPs.So, when I say ""European Union,"" what is the first thing that comes into your mind? And what is the first thing that comes into MPs' minds?7) The most referred-to feelings Conservative MPs associate with the EU are ""uneasy"", ""angry"" and ""hopeful."" So not that sunny.8) Labour MPs are positively beaming: ""hopeful"", ""proud"" and ""happy"" are the most popular sentiments from them.9) And what about us lot, the electorate? ""Uneasy"", ""hopeful"" - oh, and ""indifferent"".  Perhaps evidence that the kind of stuff that can obsess Westminster might not mean much to plenty of others. But at least one begs to differ, because....10) ...one MP said they wouldn't be voting in the EU referendum. I wonder who that was?"
2016-02-01,European goals,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35427610,"We know a bit about what politicians and business leaders think about the upcoming referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, but what about the world of football?Would a British exit change the character of the Premier League, which relies so heavily on European players and managers? Or would it give a boost to home-grown talent? As the January transfer window reaches its climax, we asked football experts, the governing bodies and both sides in referendum debate for their views.Football's governing bodies like to stay out of the political spotlight, and they refused to comment when asked if they were for or against the UK's EU membership.But Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore gave an insight into his position last October, in a little reported speech to the Institute of Directors. According to the International Business Times, he said: ""I believe we, in the UK, must be in Europe from a business perspective. I believe in the free movement of goods, but when it comes to services, we must be entitled, especially in the audiovisual world, to territorialism.""By services he meant broadcasting rights, which the Premier League's entire £3.3bn a year business depends on. Scudamore argued that broadcasting rights should be protected by national governments, to protect the Premier League's exports of raw live feeds of games from piracy and copyright infringement.The FA is concerned about the influx of foreign players into the top tier of the English game, which it believes is crowding out young home-grown talent. Working with the Home Office, it has brought in tougher visa restrictions on players from outside the EU, to ensure only established stars can be snapped up by English clubs.The FA declined to comment on whether it would like to see similar restrictions on players from within the EU, which could only come about if Britain left.""The interests of the FA, which is concerned about the future of the England team, and the Premier League, which is concerned with maximising the value of national and international broadcasting rights for the clubs, are far from identical.""If - after Britain left the EU - there was a strict migration quota strictly applied then one would assume that the Home Office would give preference to the thousands of workers needed to keep essential public services going. Footballers and other sports people would not be given priority, except, perhaps, for the absolute stars.""The worst case scenario for the Premier League is that it would not be permitted to attract foreign stars in great numbers and would then lose ground in international sponsorship and broadcasting rights to rivals like Spain and Germany. This would make a minor hole in the UK's invisible exports and tax receipts as well.""While Premier League teams might thus be forced to give more opportunities to home grown English players, it is doubtful whether the growing insularity of English football would actually benefit the England team because of diminished opportunities to play against the very best and to be coached by the very best.""In the end, it will all depend on how British politics evolve after an exit from the EU. If right wing 'Little Englanders' came to power, insisting on the strictest migration quotas, then the international attraction of the Premier League would be significantly reduced.""""British football, its clubs and its fans, are stronger and better off in Europe. ""For clubs, free movement plays a vital role in the transfer marker. Players from the EU can sign for UK clubs without needing a visa or work permit. ""Leaving the EU could have a big impact on foreign players, as a Guardian study has found that around two thirds of Premiership players from the EU would not meet the criteria currently used for non-Europeans to get a work visa automatically. ""Losing this unhindered access to European talent would put British clubs at a disadvantage. FA boss Martin Glenn has said that deteriorating relations between the EU and Britain is one of his 'biggest concerns'.""Fans benefit from Britain's membership of the EU. Europe's single market brings us cheaper flights, making it more affordable to see away games across Europe. Free movement, meanwhile, ensures that British fans don't face visa fees when travelling around Europe. ""But this is not just about the big leagues, it is also about the future of the sport. The EU promotes sport in schools across Europe. Under the Erasmus programme, anyone in Britain with a bright idea for a local football project can get money from the EU to get the ball rolling and make that idea a reality. Britain has received £1.5m in Erasmus sports funding over the past two years. ""Football in our country gains so much from being in Europe. Clubs and fans all benefit from European action, laws and funding. Leaving the EU would hurt our leagues, inconvenience our fans, and be a step back for the next generation of footballers.""""In the dressing room of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, the team tactics are quite clear. Run 'project fear' and scare voters about the prospect of leaving the EU. ""Their latest claims, that football would somehow be damaged by a vote to leave are utter nonsense and should be shown the red card. ""Their claims ignore the fact that outside the EU, we would be free to set our own policy on migration, visas, and work permits to suit our economy and our national game and instead assume we would apply an incredibly restrictive visa regime that literally no-one is arguing for.   ""Right now we are both prevented from implementing policies to nurture domestic talent and from bringing the top footballing talent from right across the globe. That's the worst of all worlds.""The FA has acknowledged the recent restrictions that have been introduced on skilled immigration from non-EU countries are the direct consequence of the EU's freedom of movement rules. ""This has hurt clubs' abilities to bring in players from outside of the EU while preventing any limits from being imposed within the EU. That's not a decision of anyone we elect, that's thanks to the controversial 1995 Bosman ruling in the European Court of Justice. This trade-off has happened across the economy, but what if it didn't have to give up control on players from inside and outside of the EU? ""What if the UK and the FA got to decide who plays in the Premier league from abroad rather than unaccountable and unelected EU judges? That's what would happen if we vote leave. Don't believe the scaremongering to the contrary."" ""Leaving the EU will be of great benefit for British football for it will mean we can lift our horizons to recruit from the rest of the world because it will become easier to introduce footballers from countries outside the EU. ""All we hear is the scaremongering about leaving the EU when the truth is it offers positive opportunities for us and children from poorer nations. Who could be against that?""The freedom of movement for people in the EU comes at the price of heavy restrictions on visas for potential signings from Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia. Once we leave the EU the UK will be free to treat footballers from all countries equally which will broaden the pool of talent for our teams, not reduce it. ""Why should our clubs find it difficult to gain a work permit for a highly talented Moroccan or Nigerian but a Belgian of only average talent is made an easy option. Surely it makes sense to treat everyone equally and let our clubs decide who they want to sign?"" "
2016-02-01,Diplomatic battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32890895,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron is engaged in intensive diplomacy in Europe to win Britain's partners over to his ambitious plans for EU reform. The UK will hold an in/out referendum on its EU membership by the end of 2017. But what priorities do other EU countries bring to the table? How much overlap with the UK is there? UKMr Cameron's Conservative government sees controlling immigration from the EU as a top priority. Limiting options for EU migrants to claim welfare benefits could make moving to the UK less attractive. Mr Cameron says his main purpose is to eradicate abuse of the system.From 2004 the UK saw a huge surge in migration from Eastern Europe - especially Poland - with EU enlargement.Free movement of people is enshrined as a fundamental right in the EU treaties. It is one of the ""four freedoms"" of the single market - people, goods, services and capital. The European Commission - the EU's executive - says that those freedoms are non-negotiable.Under Mr Cameron's plans, EU migrants new to the UK would not be able to claim in-work benefits, such as tax credits and access to social housing, for four years. The Commission says such a move would be ""highly problematic"", but is considering whether the UK could have an ""emergency brake"" to curb immigration from the EU. The brake might be invoked if the UK could show that migrants were putting too much strain on schools, hospitals and other services.Mr Cameron's other three priorities cover:You can read more about the UK government's EU reform agenda in this Q&A.GermanyEU migrants' welfare claims are certainly a political issue in Germany. The influx of non-EU migrants has put huge pressure on German housing and welfare. A record 1.1 million migrants sought asylum in Germany in 2015.In November 2014 the European Court of Justice backed Germany's right to deny certain benefits to a Romanian woman and her son living in Germany, in the Dano case. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government favours a six-month limit for EU jobseekers, after which they can be expelled from the country, tougher qualification rules for child benefit paid to children living outside Germany and a re-entry ban for welfare fraudsters. That is an agenda similar to Mr Cameron's.But Germany is worried about any UK restrictions on in-work benefits for EU migrants, Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform says.""Germany won't upset the Poles - Germany's relations with Poland are arguably as important as those with the UK,"" he told the BBC.Germany has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe and relies heavily on migrant workers from fellow EU states, many of them Poles.Like the UK Conservatives, the German government is keen to develop the single market. But in the services sector there are some strong vested interests in ""protected"" professions - areas where foreign competitors face high barriers to entry.Germany is one of the strongest advocates of deeper eurozone integration, to bolster the single currency. That has already caused some tensions with the UK.Mrs Merkel wanted a treaty change to enforce new EU-wide budget rules - something that Mr Cameron famously vetoed in December 2011. His veto came after France and Germany had refused to grant a separate ""protocol"" to exempt the City of London from new EU financial service regulations.FranceThere are worries in the French political elite - as in Germany - that Mr Cameron's reform ideas could trigger EU treaty change. That is anathema to President Francois Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, both of whom must fight general elections in 2017.Mr Hollande defends the freedom of movement principle, but there is great concern about immigration in France, particularly after Islamist extremists managed to enter from Belgium undetected last November to murder 130 people in Paris. Mr Hollande's main political rival, conservative ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, is urging reform of the Schengen passport-free travel system. National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen wants barriers to immigration - she totally rejects EU migration policy. So there is some French sympathy for Mr Cameron's demands, though French concerns tend to focus on radicalisation of Muslims in the banlieues (suburbs).French welfare benefits - as in many other EU countries - are mainly insurance-based. The UK's welfare system is more universal - funded out of general taxation. Stephen Booth of the Open Europe think-tank says the UK system makes it harder to change in-work benefits without other Europeans seeing it as discrimination. ""The UK tax credit system doesn't fall neatly into EU definitions of social security,"" he told the BBC.On the single market, France's economic woes have made its politicians more open to liberalisation, and that is happening in some sectors, albeit slowly. Prime Minister Manuel Valls is seen as pro-business and there is French support for creating a capital markets union, so that businesses can turn to financial services other than banks for loans.But France remains hostile to British calls for cuts in agricultural spending.The NetherlandsFree trade lies at the heart of the Dutch commitment to the EU, so in that respect the Dutch position is very close to the UK's.The Dutch government presented EU reform proposals in 2013 which called for less EU regulation, in language similar to Mr Cameron's. They opposed further EU attempts to harmonise social security systems.And the proposals said ""ever closer union"" should not be a general ambition. EU leaders have already started addressing UK concerns on that score. Their summit conclusions in June 2014 said: ""The concept of ever closer union allows for different paths of integration for different countries, allowing those that want to deepen integration to move ahead, while respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further.""The Netherlands supports UK calls to reform the EU's structural funds - big allocations to the EU's poorest regions, which are managed from Brussels. The idea is to end the bureaucratic procedure whereby net contributors to the EU budget send money to Brussels, only for it to be returned in the form of structural funds.Italy Italy is on the frontline of the EU's migration crisis in the Mediterranean and has played a key role in shaping the response to it.Facing unprecedented boatloads of migrants fleeing turmoil in Libya, Italy urged its EU partners to share the burden of housing them and processing asylum claims. That EU burden-sharing is going very slowly - and Greece is now the most urgent challenge. Syrian refugees are the biggest group among thousands of migrants who sail to Greek islands daily from Turkey. The UK has sent naval help to the Mediterranean, but it wants the EU to focus more on smashing people-smuggling networks and stopping the migrants before they reach Libya or Turkey.With its low birth rate Italy faces a big demographic challenge, like Germany, so it does not want measures that could discriminate against EU migrants. Many Italians also work elsewhere in the EU.UK ideas for boosting the single market and competitiveness could however win support in Italy, as its economy is fragile.PolandPolish leaders dislike Mr Cameron's plans on migrant benefits, fearing that they might discriminate against many Polish citizens living in the UK. In recent years more than 800,000 Poles have settled in the UK.However, the new right-wing Polish government is likely to be sympathetic to UK concerns about sovereignty.European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is playing a key role in the UK negotiations.On the euro, both countries worry about a eurozone ""inner club"" developing. Poland is treaty-bound to join the euro in future - unlike the UK. But it is equally concerned to protect its voting rights in economic policy.Poland and other former communist countries want more of the EU budget to be spent in their region, so that they can catch up with the older EU member states. They object to the British budget rebate, which was worth €5.3bn (£3.7bn; $5.8bn) to the UK in 2014.SwedenSweden is often seen as one of the UK's natural allies in Europe, sharing the UK enthusiasm for free trade and the business opportunities in the single market.And like the UK it has stayed out of the euro - though it does not have a treaty opt-out.Immigration has become a thorny issue in Sweden too.Like Mr Cameron, Sweden is keen to lessen the EU's regulatory burden, but it puts more emphasis on protecting workers' rights and promoting the green economy.Mr Cameron can rely on Swedish support for completing the EU single market and reforming the EU budget to help give Europe more economic clout globally.The Swedish parliament is one of the most pro-active in scrutinising EU legislation and in using the ""yellow card"" system, whereby several parliaments acting together can send EU laws back to Brussels for revision. That also brings Sweden closer to the UK Conservatives' agenda."
2016-02-01,Slow march,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35414075,"Chancellor George Osborne closed his 2011 Budget speech by setting out his aspiration for ""a Britain carried aloft by the march of the makers"". Part of his vision for the future was an economy with a more prominent role for manufacturing.How much has changed since then? The figures are not very flattering. The latest GDP figures (for the final quarter of last year) show manufacturing output slightly below the level it was at when Mr Osborne gave that earlier Budget speech.  Not by very much, it must be said - about half a percentage point. If you compare the picture today with the onset of the recession - the start of 2008 - the picture is rather more unkind. Manufacturing activity is 6.4% below that level. In other words, we are still making less than we did before the recession or at the time of Mr Osborne's speech. The number of jobs in manufacturing has actually gone up since 2011 by about 90,000, to 2.65 million, but it is still below the pre-recession level.  But was the chancellor's hope ever realistic? If we look at the history of manufacturing one thing is very clear. Fewer of us work in it than used to. In 1841, it was more than a third of the working population and it remained reasonably steady for 120 years. At the time of the census in 2011 it was down to 9%. If we look at the level of output in the sector we see a rather complex picture. The trend after World War Two was one of growth. Office for National Statistics data take us back to 1948. In the following half century or so manufacturing activity increased at an average annual rate of close to 1.9%. There were marked downturns during recessions, but longer periods between them when the sector's output grew. It peaked at the turn of the century. There followed a decline and renewed growth until the year before the most recent recession when it achieved a level just short of the 2000 peak. Then came the downturn, the Great Recession, as it has been called. Manufacturing production fell sharply. It is now up from the low point, but has not regained all the lost ground. That half century of growth up to 2000 was real enough. But it was slower than the rest of the economy. That means the sector accounted for a declining share of total economy activity. Service industries grew more rapidly. The point has been underscored by developments during the latest recovery. While manufacturing is still below its pre-recession level, the service industries, which did suffer a decline, are now 12% ahead. The UK is not alone in its experience of a declining share of manufacturing.  As of today, the UK figure is among the lowest in the rich countries. At 11% according to World Bank data in 2014, it was the same as France, ahead of Norway and Australia (which have large natural resource industries so you might expect that) and just behind the US.For most others the share was higher, more than 20% in Germany (2013 figures) and 30% in South Korea, a comparatively new member of the club of advanced economies.  The figures are also relatively high in some of the former communist economies of Eastern Europe.But over the years, most of the rich nations have seen their manufacturing shares decline as the sector has been outstripped by service industries' growth.   There are also countries outside this group that have seen the share of manufacturing decline. China is down to 36% from 42% in 1981.There are some fundamental forces at work according to some economists.  Stephen Broadberry and Tim Leunig of the London School of Economics say half the decline can be explained by the falling prices of manufactured goods compared with other products, and by the fact that people tend to spend more of their income on services as they get richer. There have also been competitive challenges, from other rich countries and lower-cost challengers.  Steven Fothergill and Tony Gore of Sheffield Hallam University wrote: ""In the face of competition from low-wage economies such as China, for the vast majority of UK manufacturing there has simply been no alternative to going down the high-value route.""None of this means that there is no future for manufacturing in the UK. Far from it. In 2014, the Boston Consulting Group described UK manufacturing as a ""rising regional star"" in terms of the competitiveness of national manufacturing.There has been what some have described as a renaissance in British car making.But there have been some very conspicuous industrial setbacks, notably to steel producers, which could do some damage to other areas of the economy.The TUC's secretary general, Frances O'Grady, as well as criticising the government's response to the steel crisis, described manufacturing more widely as one of Mr Osborne's failures. ""If the government had made the right choices with strong investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation, we could be in a much stronger position,"" she said.Mr Osborne's remarks about manufacturing back in 2011 have also drawn some criticism from a very different perspective, from people with a very free market perspective. Earlier this month, Michael Martins of the Institute of Directors wrote: ""Certain types of manufacturing can be, and are, successful in Britain, but it is not intrinsically better than the service sector. The sooner the chancellor acknowledges this, the better"". Philip Booth of the Institute of Economic Affairs, writing soon after the 2011 Budget was even more scathing: ""Entrepreneurs do not need George Osborne to decide whether they should be involved in 'making' or 'serving' and the government should stop trying to shape the future of Britain's economy."" What is clear from the data is the makers have not marched very far, not yet at least. The most recent GDP figures show them standing rooted to the spot. But they remain an important feature of the British economic landscape.  "
2016-02-01,Could EU break up?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202151314/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35405896,"For the past 10 days, Europe's leaders have been engaged in a bout of gloom.  They openly admit Europe has lost control of the migrant crisis, and they fear for the future of the European project itself.Certainly, the Schengen agreement - which guarantees freedom of movement and is one of the pillars of European unity - is being widely ignored as fences go up and border controls reappear.On Monday Greece was even warned that it could find itself excluded from the Schengen area if the flow of migrants is not stemmed.But do these leaders really believe the European Union itself is at risk? It strains credibility to believe the single market is at risk and European project could fall apart in months.But there is an element of fear seeping through the corridors of the Berlaymont building in Brussels and the Bundestag in Berlin.At the heart of the crisis, the problem is simple: ""We cannot cope,"" Mr Rutte said, ""with the numbers any longer."" In 2015, 1.83 million migrants came to Europe, of which 1.1 million sought asylum in Germany. More than 35,000 have crossed from Turkey into Greece since the start of the year.German leaders have repeatedly said migrants are a European problem, but that analysis is not universally shared. Many politicians in Eastern and Central Europe incline to a different script: that Mrs Merkel encouraged large numbers of migrants by essentially laying out a welcome mat. The Germans, according to this narrative, provided the pull factor but are insisting others share the burden of dealing with the crisis. So there are divisions and mistrust.The European Commission believed the answer lay in sharing out the refugees between countries. It was agreed 160,000 migrants would be resettled across Europe.Only 331 have been moved so far. Countries - irritated by majority voting - have simply ignored the plan.Mrs Merkel made a big bet on Turkey: that in exchange for €3bn and the offer of visa-free travel, Turkey would slow the numbers crossing the narrow straits to Greece. But not all the funds have been forthcoming, and Turkey has frustrated Europe's leaders with its lack of action.In the meantime, countries began implementing their own measures. Hungary built a fence. Germany, Austria,France, Denmark, Sweden and Norway all began introducing checks at their borders. It amounted to a suspension of the Schengen agreement.  They insisted the controls were temporary, but they are looking to extend them. Further plans have continued to cascade out of the commission's meetings.There would be a compulsory sharing out of refugees across the EU - even though it has shown little evidence of this working so far.Secondly, Greece and Italy - the two countries where most of the migrants first arrived - would create hotspots, or reception camps, where people would be registered. Those who did not qualify for asylum would be turned around. But in Greece, only one out of five planned camps has been built. And if the migrants are refused asylum, it is unclear which force will physically remove them from Europe and where they will go.German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel hinted aid would be withdrawn from North African countries if they did not take back rejected asylum seekers.Many of Europe's leaders believe it will be impossible to save Schengen if Europe's external borders are not secured allowing potential refugees to be screened and processed and not just waved through to Austria and Germany.  But they have lost faith in Greece's ability to do this, so the commission has proposed a European Border and Coast Guard force, which in an emergency could overrule national governments. Such a force would impinge on sovereignty. Arguments are likely to be fierce before it is operational, and it is unclear what would happen if governments objected.Pressure is growing on Greece to cooperate. There is talk of Greece having to leave Schengen if it does not agree to take the border guards, or that the Schengen border could be moved  - maybe to Slovenia - so Greece no longer forms part of the EU's external frontier.But it is not just a case of Greece being awkward. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras fears if Greece starts processing all the migrants and denying some of them asylum, the country could become ""a massive refugee camp"".And if the border moved to a country such as Slovenia, then there too a no-man's land for stranded refugees could develop.In the meantime, countries act unilaterally. Macedonia, on Greece's northern border, is building a 10ft (3m) razor-wire fence. Austria has decided to cap the number of asylum seekers it will accept in 2016, at 37,500.All the time, the pressure grows on Mrs Merkel to cap the number Germany will accept. She continues to refuse. Not only would it be an acceptance her policy had failed - but she fears the refugee problem would be pushed back into Eastern Europe and the Balkans, further undermining the Schengen agreement. The pressure the German chancellor is under was reflected in the words of the German President Joachim Gauck, who said refugee quotas might be ""morally and politically necessary"".Even in the winter months the numbers of migrants has not subsided. Some 2,000 are continuing to arrive each day, which - some of Europe's leaders insist - is unsustainable.What this chapter of events underlines is how difficult it has been to forge a European response to the crisis.It raises questions about German leadership.It reflects the pressure on politicians to look after their own national interests by slowing down migrant numbers. It has exposed divisions between Eastern Europe and the northern countries. It reflects different values, a resistance in the East to embrace a multicultural society they have little experience of.And that clash of values is also evident in Germany, where the Bavarian leader Horst Seehofer - an ally of Mrs Merkel - questions what more refugees will do to the country.""That is then a different society. And the people don't want Germany or Bavaria to become a different society,"" he said.So what will happen? The answer almost certainly does not lie in the commission's plans.EU countries will have to use their financial power to persuade other countries to take back failed asylum seekers. A huge investment - as the German Finance Minister has suggested - will have to be made in countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon to persuade them to keep people in camps but in much better conditions than they are at present. In the longer term, it will probably require some sort of Marshall plan to prevent people fleeing the countries on the rim of the Mediterranean. It may be that, like Canada, the EU will take only refugee families from Syria, rather than young men. And it may be, as some politicians are suggesting, the EU will have to demonstrate a greater willingness to deport failed seekers of asylum.The EU's immense achievement of helping to sow peace in Europe and spread democracy is not at risk - but the migrant crisis is tearing at the fabric of a community of shared values."

The deal, which includes an ""emergency brake"" on migrant benefits, paves the way for the UK's EU referendum to take place as early as June.EU exit campaigners said it did not come close to what the PM had promised.But the prime minister says it is a deal ""worth fighting for"" and he is launching a fresh round of diplomacy to persuade other EU leaders to sign up to it.The draft deal was published by European Council president Donald Tusk after months of negotiations between UK and EU officials.Mr Cameron's proposed four year ban on in-work benefits for EU migrant workers could come into force immediately if the UK votes to remain in the Union.But it would have to be agreed by other EU nations and it would be ""graduated"", with more money from tax credits paid to migrants the longer they remain in the UK.It says Mr Cameron's demand to exempt Britain from the EU principle of ""ever closer union"" between member states would be written into a future treaty.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations.Migration: The prime minister got his emergency welfare brake. But it is not clear how easy it will be to pull that brake or how long it will last, writes deputy political editor James Landale.Benefits: While the in-work benefits of EU migrants will be curbed for four years if other countries agree, they will be gradually restored the longer they stay in the UK. EU migrants will be able to send child benefit back home, but would get a lower level if the cost of living in the country where the child is is lower. Mr Cameron had wanted to block all of it. Sovereignty: The PM has secured a clear legal statement that the UK is not committed to further political integration and that the phrase ""ever closer union"" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties. He has also got new powers for national parliaments to block new EU laws but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used. Competitiveness: The PM has got some language that commits the EU to strengthen the internal market and cut red tape. But they have been promising to do that for years. Protecting non-euro countries: There will be a new mechanism to get the eurozone to think again about decisions that could hit the City of London. Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.

A July or September referendum remains a possibility but a repeat of last summer's migrant crisis in the Mediterranean and eastern Europe could make Mr Cameron's job of making the case for remaining in a reformed EU more difficult.A cross-party group of MPs, led by the SNP, has warned Mr Cameron against holding the EU referendum in June, arguing it will be too close to elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, London and local authorities. Labour has said it will not block a June referendum. The prime minister said ""more work"" needed to be done to ""nail down"" details but added: ""We said we needed to deliver in four key areas, this document shows real progress on that front.""He said the proposals were some ""something worth fighting for"", and were good enough that he would back Britain joining the EU under these terms, if it was not already a member.He said Britain could have the ""best of both worlds""  by giving it access to the single market and a voice around the top EU table, while retaining its status as a ""proud independent country not part of a superstate"".He said ministers would be free to campaign for either side in a personal capacity, but the government would ""not be taking some sort of neutral position"". ""If we get this deal in February or in March or later and if the cabinet agrees to this deal the government's position will be to campaign for Britain to stay in a reformed European Union."" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg if he could guarantee the reforms would cut immigration and had not been watered down, he said: ""I can say, hand on heart, I have delivered the commitments made in my manifesto."" Read more from Laura KuenssbergRichard Tice, co-founder of Leave.Eu, accused Mr Cameron of ""trying to deceive the British people by saying that there's substantial change - there is nothing except a restatement of the existing status quo"".The Vote Leave campaign said Mr Cameron had broken a key Conservative manifesto pledge to insist on a four year ban on in-work benefits, saying that the ban was now conditional.Former defence secretary Liam Fox said the proposals did not ""come close"" to the changes voters had been promised.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron's deal was ""pathetic"" and ""hardly worth the wait"".President of the European Council Mr Tusk said the package was ""a good basis for a compromise"", adding that ""there are still challenging negotiations ahead - nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".Two of the favourites to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader, Boris Johnson and Theresa May, have also been touted as possible figureheads for the campaign to leave the EU. Mr Johnson, the London mayor, said he had ""doubts"" about the red card mechanism, saying there was ""much, much more that needs to be done"" on European reform.Home Secretary Mrs May also said more needed to be done, but added:  ""This is a basis for a deal."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she appeared on the verge of backing the prime minister and that her reaction would come as a blow to the Out campaign.Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed.But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. Read more: James says Cameron in campaigning modeThe BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler says: ""My first instinct is that this is something everyone can work with. ""Eastern and Central European countries will continue to complain about the suspension of migrant in-work benefits.  ""They are likely to argue that the EU has sold its principles down the river in an attempt to keep the UK in the EU. ""However it can be argued from this text that the so-called 'emergency brake' is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.""

2016-02-02,Labour calls for Scots income tax rise,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35461968,"Labour has called for an immediate 1p increase in Scottish income tax rates.The party said the move would raise about £500m every year, which it said would be enough to avoid cuts to education and other local services.Holyrood will be given limited powers over income tax rates from April, with more flexible powers later due to be devolved under the Scotland Bill.The Scottish government has said it will not alter income tax rates until these greater powers come into force.But that will not be until next year at the earliest. Under the more limited powers, which have been devolved under the Scotland Act 2012, any changes in income tax rates would need to be replicated across all bands.The Scottish government has argued that this would mean the least well-off would be hit hardest by any increase. In his draft budget, which was unveiled in December, Finance Secretary John Swinney said he would be keeping income tax rates in Scotland the same as the rest of the UK in 2016/17.He said he hoped the greater flexibility in setting income tax rates offered by the Scotland Bill proposals would allow the the Scottish government to introduce a ""more progressive"" tax regime in the future.But Scottish Labour said its plan for a 1p rise in income tax across all bands from April would be offset by taxpayers earning less than £20,000 receiving a £100 annual boost to their income through a payment scheme. This £100 payment, which would be administered by councils, would be ""far in excess"" of the additional £20 which someone earning just above the minimum wage would pay in income tax over the course a year, the party said. Labour said someone on a salary of about £30,000 a year would pay less than £4 a week extra under its plan.But someone on the same £144,687 wage as the first minister would pay an extra £28 a week (£1,447 a year), it said.Read more hereScottish Labour's proposal would mean that income tax rates in Scotland would be higher than elsewhere in the UK.Leader Kezia Dugdale, said: ""Given the choice between using our powers or making cuts to our children's future, we choose to use our powers.""We will tear up this SNP budget that simply manages Tory cuts and instead use the power we have to set the Scottish rate of income tax 1p higher than the rate set by George Osborne. This will provide an extra half a billion pounds a year to invest in the future.""We don't do this because we want to use the powers for their own sake. We do it because there is no other alternative to cutting into our nation's future.""Mr Swinney's draft budget is due to be debated at Holyrood on Wednesday.SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said questions surrounded the figures being quoted by Scottish Labour.He told BBC Scotland: ""The Revenue and Customs say it's £475m. A £50m rebate would mean it's £425m.""There would be administration costs. Would councils have to pay the administration costs or are Labour going to pay that?""There's an HMRC charge. The fact is there are so many questions about this policy, I don't think it gets even off the starting block.""Last week, the Scottish Liberal Democrats also proposed increasing income tax rates by 1p to raise extra funds for schools.But the Scottish Conservatives have said that taxes in Scotland should be no higher than the rest of the UK - and lower when affordable.Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: ""It would hit every basic rate taxpayer in the pocket. It would damage jobs and hurt Scotland's economic revival. And it would add ridiculous complexity to our tax system - with the lowest paid being asked to go to their local council  to get a £100 cashback on a tax rise they never asked for. ""It simply isn't credible.""The Scottish Greens the ability to adjust the Scottish rate of income tax to make the tax take progressive was ""extremely limited"" and Labour's proposal would involve ""extra complexity and cost""."
2016-02-02,Councils to get Sunday trading powers,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35475935,"Ministers are to press ahead with plans to allow councils in England and Wales to relax Sunday trading laws.Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the move would allow local authorities to ""help struggling High Streets"".He told MPs the policy, previously reported to be facing strong opposition in the Commons, would be added to the government's Enterprise Bill.Unions said ministers were ""behaving disgracefully by trying to change Sunday trading by the back door"".Devolving Sunday trading laws to councils was first announced by George Osborne in the July Budget, and a consultation into the change closed in September.Small shops - up to 280 sq m -  are currently entitled to open when they want, but on Sundays, larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00.In the Commons, Mr Javid's Labour shadow Angela Eagle criticised the way the government was seeking to make the change and as well as what she said was a lack of detail.She accused Mr Javid of a ""gross abuse of power"" asking why the plans were being added ""at this late stage"" rather than being in the Bill from the start.Mr Javid said the government's intentions ""have been clear"" and said amending the Enterprise Bill, which is currently making its way through the Commons, was ""the right vehicle to make those changes"".He told MPs the decision to change Sunday trading hours would be ""entirely local"", adding: ""If the people of Bromsgrove or Barking say they want to see longer Sunday opening hours, who are we here in Westminster to stand in their way?""Under the proposals, local authorities will be able to restrict the longer hours to certain zones - such as High Streets and city centres, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said.It promised that shop workers who wanted to ""opt out"" of working on Sundays would be able to do so, for example on religious or family grounds.The response to the consultation would be published ""shortly"", the government said.Retail union Usdaw said MPs should be able to ""properly consider"" the views expressed in the consultation.General secretary John Hannett  described the current Sunday Trading Act as a ""great British compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years and gives everyone a little bit of what they want.""Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work; whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shop workers can spend some time with their family."""
2016-02-02,UKIP members to set candidate rankings,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-35470132,"UKIP members will decide the final rankings of regional candidates for May's assembly elections after a row within the party.Some local UKIP branches have raised concerns candidates from outside Wales would be imposed on them.UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said the decision to give party members the final say was ""a great victory"".Former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless will be among the names under consideration.There have been allegations of splits within the party's top ranks over the issue.In January, UKIP councillor Kevin Mahoney said he would quit the party if Mr Hamilton, Mr Reckless and Alexandra Phillips, UKIP's head of media in Wales, were selected on the regional lists. Opinion polls suggest UKIP is likely to win seats in the assembly for the first time at May's elections.Applications to be regional candidates are narrowed down to a shortlist. Party members then decide the order that those candidates are listed for the four seats in each of the assembly's five regions.Mr Gill told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's gone back to the grassroots, it's gone back to the membership. We have had a great victory here.""I think it's up to the members to decide for themselves who they want to represent UKIP in Wales.""UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""I have long argued that the UKIP members in Wales should get the final say on who represents our party in the Welsh assembly elections.""These elections in May are our best opportunity to make a breakthrough into UK domestic politics.""This is the first time Nathan Gill has spoken publicly about his ""big battle"" with the party's national executive committee over the selection of regional candidates.It's difficult to argue with a system that means local party members will have the final say over who tops the regional list.If Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are as unpopular with local party members as some have been saying, then presumably they won't be anywhere near the top of the list.Nathan Gill has been claiming victory. But bearing in mind this is a party that likes to take the moral high-ground in being above all a grassroots organisation, is it a battle it should have been having in the first place?Behind the scenes, this has been a damaging row internally for UKIP in Wales. The party will be hoping the decision will heal some of those divisions."
2016-02-02,'Plebgate' officer denies misconduct,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35473743,"A police officer thanked Andrew Mitchell for his ""candour"" at a meeting to discuss the ""plebgate"" row, but the following day told a radio station he had been evasive, a tribunal has heard. Det Sgt Stuart Hinton and two other Police Federation representatives met the Tory MP in October 2012, weeks after the Downing Street incident.The next day, he told the BBC the MP should resign for not fully explaining.The officer denies breaching police standards on honesty.The ""plebgate"" row centred on a 15-second confrontation in September 2012 between Mr Mitchell and PC Toby Rowland, in which - according to the Sun newspaper -  the then Conservative chief whip called the officer a ""pleb"" for his refusal to permit him to cycle through the main gates at Downing Street.Opening a gross misconduct case against Det Sgt Hinton, Aaron Rathmell said a recording of the meeting, which was played to the tribunal, showed the MP had admitted to swearing at a police officer during an exchange at the gates of Downing Street but denied calling him a ""pleb"". The recording also revealed that during the meeting Det Sgt Hinton praised Mr Mitchell for his ""candour"" after the MP told them what happened and said he was ""profoundly and deeply sorry"". Following the meeting, serving Warwickshire Police officer Det Sgt Hinton made comments, in an interview on BBC Radio Five Live on 13 October, about what was said at that meeting. The tribunal is considering whether these remarks were deliberately misleading.Mr Rathmell told the tribunal: ""Mr Hinton appeared on BBC radio and commented: ""He (Mr Mitchell) still won't say exactly what he did say, which suggests that the officer's account is more likely to be the accurate one."" Mr Rathmell said Det Sgt Hinton made these comments despite the fact he seemed satisfied with the answers he heard in the meeting, telling Mr Mitchell ""I appreciate your candour"" and later ""everybody can have a bad day"".Det Sgt Hinton and two colleagues from neighbouring forces had used the meeting ""as a springboard"" for a publicity campaign against government spending cuts, Mr Rathmell said. He added: ""The key controversy in this case surrounds exercising of judgment as to whether Sgt Hinton gave a misleading account regarding the meeting with Mr Mitchell, rather than facts or witnesses' statements being in dispute.""Mr Mitchell was forced to resign from the cabinet over the ""plebgate"" row but vowed to clear his name in the libel courts, launching an action against the Sun. But a judge ruled in 2014 that the MP probably had called PC Rowland a ""pleb"", and Mr Mitchell was ordered to pay damages as well as the Sun's legal costs.The misconduct panel is being held at the Warwickshire Police headquarters to hear an allegation the officer breached the force's professional standards of honesty, integrity and conduct.Det Sgt Hinton, who was secretary of the local Police Federation branch at the time, denies any wrongdoing.The hearing, which is scheduled for up to three days, continues."
2016-02-02,"Tackle cold homes, ministers told",https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35459447,"Bringing the UK's ageing homes into the 21st century should be a key infrastructure priority, ministers have been told.The government is consulting on a multi-billion pound plan for roads, rail, flood defences and energy.But opposition parties and institutions have told BBC News that home energy efficiency is equally important.Unless homes are insulated, they say the UK will miss targets to end fuel poverty and cut carbon emissions.The plan to make home energy efficiency a key infrastructure priority was proposed by the right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange (PX).BBC News found wide support, including from Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru, the CBI, TUC, the union GMB, the left-leaning think-tank IPPR, the all-party parliamentary group Green Alliance, the World Energy Council, the Institution of Civil Engineering and leading energy academics.The government declined to comment but its advisory body the National Infrastructure Commission said it would consider whether to take the idea further.PX argues that improving home efficiency creates many jobs; combats fuel poverty; reduces air pollution; minimises carbon emissions; cuts fuel imports; benefits the balance of payments; and reduces the need to build new power stations.""It's pretty much a no-brainer,"" said Richard Howard of PX. ""Bringing people's homes up to standard is incredibly good value for money. We don't typically think of housing as infrastructure like we think of roads and railways - but we've got to change the way we approach this: housing is critical infrastructure."" The CBI's Rhian Kelly told BBC News: ""Energy efficiency in homes and businesses is often at the back of the queue, so it's right that we see a sharper focus on making buildings more insulated, leading to significant savings for households and firms and important environmental benefits.""Professor Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said:  ""For too long, there has been an assumption that infrastructure includes energy supply and energy networks, whereas the type and quantity of energy we use (and might need in future) is heavily dependent on infrastructures that use energy such as buildings, vehicles and appliances.""Christophe Frei, General Secretary of the World Energy Council, said: ""This is such a no-brainer. It responds to energy efficiency, addressing fuel poverty, replacing new capacity requirement - and the financing is so much easier to do because the pay-back period is so short. But it needs the policies.""Among the organisations the BBC contacted, only the Institute for Economic Affairs did not back the plan, saying that using taxpayers' funds to improve housing was not a good use of public money.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin and Facebook https://www.facebook.com/roger.harrabin"
2016-02-02,Crime chief faced criticism in last job,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35466283,"New National Crime Agency head Lynne Owens was appointed amid concerns about her performance as chief constable of Surrey Police, the BBC has learned.Kevin Hurley, Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner, said he had considered seeking her dismissal before she took over the national policing role.Concerns about public protection and child safeguarding in Surrey were down to a ""failure of leadership"", he said.Mrs Owens said she underwent a ""lengthy and thorough"" NCA interview process. The Home Office said she was an ""exceptional"" policing leader.Last November, Mrs Owens, 47, saw off strong competition to be named director-general of the National Crime Agency - one of the most prestigious and highly paid roles in policing. The NCA has responsibility for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre - known as CEOP. But in the months leading up to her appointment, Mrs Owens's record on child protection had been brought into question by Mr Hurley.  Highly critical inspection reports of the force had led Mr Hurley to declare that he had lost confidence in Mrs Owens and was considering starting the formal process - known as Section 38 - that could have led to her dismissal.Criticisms included the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) finding failings in the way the Surrey force had handled the case of 14-year-old Breck Bednar, who was groomed online before being murdered.Mr Hurley had previously been a supporter of his chief constable, extending her contract in 2012 and writing to Home Secretary Theresa May in 2014 to say she had had an ""outstanding year"".But during the 12 months leading up to November 2015, all that had changed.  Emails and documents disclosed to BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act show that over this period, Mr Hurley's confidence in the chief constable's ability to deal with the problems ebbed away.The minutes of a public protection scrutiny meeting on 3 September reveal the PCC's concerns about the force's handling of rape, domestic abuse and female genital mutilation cases - as well as child protection.In September, Mr Hurley wrote a stinging 10-page letter to Mrs Owens saying he held her ""personally responsible"".He accused her of blaming others for the ""litany of failures"", claiming it was ""an example of moral cowardice"". He wrote: ""You have failed to act decisively or speedily to address many areas of concern in relation to public protection."" Mrs Owens has told the BBC these comments were ""ill-considered and inaccurate"".Mr Hurley delivered the letter to Mrs Owens at a meeting, during which she declared that she was applying for the NCA post.At the same meeting, Mr Hurley revealed he had been considering starting the formal process that could lead to Mrs Owens being dismissed or having to resign from the force.Mr Hurley then wrote to Sir Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, stating concerns that Surrey Police was ""failing vulnerable children, rape and domestic violence victims"" and asking for assistance. Mrs Owens issued a detailed 19-page rebuttal of the PCC's accusations, saying her 26-year police record was ""unblemished"" and that she had taken ""immediate and muscular"" action in response to child protection concerns.But in October, Mr Hurley wrote again to Sir Tom, saying: ""I have lost confidence in the chief constable's ability to lead the necessary cultural changes and cannot be sure that, under her command, the threat, risk and harm of public protection-related issues will be properly addressed.""Mr Hurley has said he was not asked about Mrs Owens's suitability for the NCA position, and only found out about her new job by a message posted by a journalist on social media.He said that had Mrs Owens not been appointed he would have started the formal dismissal process.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is a failure of leadership. The chief constable is the leader. She has let down the constables and sergeants, but more importantly she has let down our most vulnerable victims across the county."" The Inspectorate of Constabulary said it had briefed senior officials at the Home Office concerning the inspection work at Surrey, the ""nature of the correspondence"" from Mr Hurley and discussed the NCA appointment with them. However, it is understood that another inspectorate report, which is due to be published in the coming weeks, is expected to conclude that the force lacks understanding of serious and organised crime groups in Surrey and ""requires improvement"" in the way it deals with the problem.Mrs Owens said: ""I was selected to my current role by the home secretary after a lengthy and thorough process and am now focused on leading the National Crime Agency in its fight to cut serious and organised crime.""The Home Office said Mrs Owens was ""one of the exceptional policing leaders of her generation"".Officials pointed out that she went through a rigorous recruitment and selection process that included a ""testing"" panel interview. It said professional references and due diligence checks were also undertaken."
2016-02-02,'Catalogue of failures' hit Kids Company,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35455157,"The collapse of the Kids Company charity was a result of an ""extraordinary catalogue of failures"", a committee of MPs has said.The Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) also criticised the charity's trustees and the Charity Commission.Kids Company closed in August after questions over management and finances.Camila Batmanghelidjh, who founded the charity in 1996, said the report was ""a product of bias and rumour"".""The only place we got a rigorous fact-based investigation was with the police,"" she said, while former trustees condemned the report as  inaccurate, unbalanced and irresponsible.However, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, told the BBC the committee had been ""very careful with this report because we knew it was so controversial"".The inquiry had heard ""an extraordinary catalogue of failures of governance and control at every level - trustees, auditors, inspectors, regulators and government"", he said.The committee had heard positive accounts of valuable work by Kids Company, and of ""inspired and motivated employees"", which made the trustee board's failure to ensure the charity's sustainability ""all the more tragic"", he said.But he added that there had been ""a litany of allegations of inappropriate 'therapies', lavish spending and abuse of power within the organisation"".The charity supported deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol.By Lucy Manning, BBC News special correspondentThe report spares no one: Camila Batmanghelidjh, the trustees, government ministers, the auditors and regulators are all criticised.The heaviest criticism is for the trustees led by the BBC's Alan Yentob.He's described as someone who condoned excessive spending and lacked proper attention to his duties. The BBC is also accused of poor leadership for failing to take action against him when he tried to make suggestions about the BBC's reporting of Kids Company.The report also makes clear that even without the police investigation that triggered the charity's collapse, it would have been unlikely to survive due to the trustees' financial negligence and Ms Batmanghelidjh's reluctance to restructure the organisation she founded.Overall it makes for very sorry reading about a charity doing some good work let down by those who ran it, those who were supposed to oversee it and those who kept funding it without making proper checks.Mr Yentob and Ms Batmanghelidjh kept insisting there had been no financial mismanagement. This report makes clear there certainly was.Newsnight's Chris Cook pores over MPs' verdictWhile the committee's report said ultimate responsibility for the charity's closure was on its ""negligent"" trustees, the government and regulators must also learn lessons from its failure.  It was unacceptable that successive ministers appeared to release funds to the charity ""on the basis of little more than their relationship with a charismatic leader, small-scale studies and anecdotes"", it said. The committee says such an approach was an unjustifiable way to conduct government business and to handle public money. Ms Batmanghelidjh and Kids Company ""appeared to captivate some of the most senior political figures in the land, by the force of the chief executive's personality as much as by the spin and profile she generated for the charity"", the report added.The committee also highlighted ""extraordinary accounts of luxury items and holidays or spa days being lavished on 'Camila's kids', a favoured group of clients"". Conservative minister Oliver Letwin appeared before the committee in November to explain why he overruled civil service objections to pay a £3m grant to Kids Company just days before it collapsed.Speaking after the committee's report was issued, he said he believed it was ""the right thing to do to give this charity one last chance to restructure"".He said the government would be reviewing its grant-giving process ""in light of what we now know about Kids Company"".""By updating the process by which grants are awarded we will make sure the most stable, most effective charities receive taxpayer funds,"" he said.June 2015: Concerns raised by the Cabinet Office about Kids Company's request for a £3m government grant, but ministers approve the fundingJuly 2015: Ms Batmanghelidjh steps down, denying the charity has been mismanaged. The Met Police launches an investigation into allegations of failings and abuse linked to the charity.August 2015: Ministers say they want to recover the government grant. The charity closes. Ms Batmanghelidjh tells the BBC that Kids Company was subjected to a ""trial by media""October 2015: Ms Batmanghelidjh and Kids Company chairman Alan Yentob (at the time also a BBC executive) appear before the Commons Public Administration Committee and again deny the charity was badly run. The National Audit Office says the charity received at least £46m of public money despite repeated concerns over its managementJanuary 2016: The Met Police says it has concluded its investigation into allegations against the charity, and concluded there is no evidence of criminalityWhat went wrong?The report also said the charity's board of trustees ignored repeated warnings about the charity's financial health throughout its 19-year existence.It also failed to provide robust evidence of the charity's outcomes, or address increasing concerns about its programmes and behaviour of staff, it said.The trustees' negligent financial management was ultimately responsible for the charity's inability to survive, and its closure left many vulnerable beneficiaries without support, it concluded.The Metropolitan Police last week announced they had found no evidence of criminality after investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the charity. Kids Company had always denied the claims.And the PACAC also called on the Charity Commission to raise its profile so as to provide a more visible outlet for people to raise concerns with.""The commission projects too limited a public profile to provide much reassurance about charities and their regulation, and to attract complaints,"" the report said.  Camila's Kids Company: The Inside Story will be broadcast on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday 3 February, and on BBC Two in Wales. "
2016-02-02,May's surveillance bill 'confusing',https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/35455343,"The home secretary's plan to force internet service providers to store everyone's internet activity is vague and confusing, says a committee of MPs.Police and security services will be able to see names of sites visited in the past year without a warrant, under the draft Investigatory Powers Bill.The science and technology Committee says its requirements are confusing, and firms fear a rise in hacking.The Home Office said it would study the report's findings. When she announced the draft bill last year, Theresa May stressed that the authorities would not be able to see individual web pages visited, just basic data, such as domain names like bbc.co.uk or facebook.com.But tech firms have told MPs it may not be possible to separate out data in that way and the plans were not clear about was meant by ""internet connection records"".Committee chairman Nicola Blackwood said: ""There remain questions about the feasibility of collecting and storing internet connection records (ICRs), including concerns about ensuring security for the records from hackers. ""The bill was intended to provide clarity to the industry, but the current draft contains very broad and ambiguous definitions of ICRs, which are confusing communications providers. ""This must be put right for the bill to achieve its stated security goals.""Mrs May insisted in January that the Home Office had been clear about what it meant by ICRs and was working closely with the industry on the legislation.The science and technology committee also raised concerns about powers to allow spies to hack into suspects' smartphones or computers, known as ""equipment interference"".Ms Blackwood said the technique may ""occasionally be necessary"", but added: ""The tech industry has legitimate concerns about the reaction of their customers to the possibility that electronic devices could be hacked by the security services.""There are also concerns, expressed by Apple and other tech giants, that the bill will force them to adopt weaker encryption standards.Some products, such as the iPhone, allow people to communicate privately in a form that cannot be decoded, even by the company which makes the device, known as ""end-to-end encryption"".The bill would strengthen the power to force firms to give up decryption keys so that coded messages might be read.But Nicola Blackwood said the government had to do more to ""allay unfounded concerns that encryption will no longer be possible"". Service providers, such as BT and Sky, are concerned about the cost of storing internet records for 12 months, something they do not routinely do at the moment.The Home Office says the overall cost to the industry will be £174m over 10 years and ""reasonable costs"" will be reimbursed, but the industry has cast doubt on that estimate.The committee said the government should make an ""explicit commitment"" to pay the full costs incurred by compliance,"" to protect smaller firms hit with demands to store records.The Home Office said it was important companies did not suffer a commercial disadvantage and stressed there were no plans to change a long-standing position of reimbursing 100% of costs associated with data retention.Security Minister John Hayes said: ""We are mindful of the need for legislation to provide law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats to our country in the modern age, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements.""The government's final proposals will be set out in the spring."
2016-02-02,Black workers 'suffer 23% pay gap',https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35441833,"Black workers earn much less than similarly qualified white workers, at all levels of education, research suggests.Analysis of pay data by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests that the difference in average pay rates amounts to a gap of 23%.Black graduates earn on average £14.33 an hour, compared with £18.63 earned by white graduates, the TUC says.The average pay gap between black and white workers with A-levels is 14%.And at GCSE level the gap is 11%, the TUC says.The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Race still plays a huge role in determining pay.""The harsh reality is that at any level of education, black and Asian workers are getting paid less than their white counterparts.""The government cannot afford to ignore these figures and must now take genuine action to tackle pay discrimination."" The Runnymede Trust, a leading race equality think tank, has previously found that pay gaps are not due to the type of university attended, as they even extend to black workers with degrees from the most selective Russell Group of universities.In fact the TUC's analysis, based on the Labour Force Survey figures from 2014 and 2015, shows the pay gaps are widest for those with higher qualifications. ""This suggests that education alone will do little to address racial inequalities, and the need for interventions that directly challenge racial inequalities in the workplace,"" the TUC said.The trade union umbrella body is calling on the government to recognise the scale of the problem and to urgently develop a race equality strategy.As part of an anti-discrimination drive announced on Sunday, David Cameron said universities in England would be forced to disclose the proportion of ethnic minority applicants who get places.The prime minister said transparency would force top universities like Oxford to work harder to broaden their intake."
2016-02-02,Google deal 'not a glorious moment',https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35453772,"Google's £130m UK tax settlement was ""not a glorious moment"" for the government, Business Secretary Sajid Javid has acknowledged.The UK tax authorities' agreement with Google has fuelled a ""sense of injustice"" that big businesses receive preferential treatment, he said.His comments come a week after Chancellor George Osborne called the settlement a ""major success"". Google said it was in favour of reforms to make international tax clearer.However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned the fallout from the tax row had damaged Google's brand.""The reputational damage to Google, I think, is immense,"" he said, and suggested the ""saving they have made in tax is not worth the reputation damage they have had"".Mr McDonnell also repeated a call for Google and HMRC to release details of how the agreement was struck.He has published his tax return, showing he paid £14,253 in tax last year, and urged the chancellor to do the same, saying taxpayers filling in their own tax returns, which are due by midnight, would be ""feeling angry"" about the Google settlement.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid agreed that ""more needs to be done"" to ensure multinational companies pay the correct corporation tax.""I speak with thousands of companies small, medium-sized as well as, of course, large companies and there is a sense of injustice in what they see,"" he said.But the Google agreement could be seen as a ""success"" in so far as it would help to change the behaviour of other large companies, he said.Big businesses will see that HMRC ""will not give up, they will come after you if they feel you're not paying your fair share in taxes,"" he said. Earlier, a senior Google executive said the company felt the global tax system, which dates back to the 1920s, needed to be updated.Peter Barron, a senior Google communications director, told the Marr Show: ""We would like to see more simplicity and more clarity, not least because we would like to be seen to be paying the right amount."" Google still follows its motto of ""Don't be evil"" and tries to do the right thing, including on tax affairs, he said.UK sales account for around 10% of Google's global revenues, but the tech giant says UK profits, which is how corporation tax is calculated, are lower."
2016-02-02,Corbyn 'low payers' plan criticised,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35454109,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's proposal to penalise firms who do not pay the Living Wage has been described as ""unworkable"" by his business spokesman.Angela Eagle told The Sunday Times the plan to ban such firms from paying dividends was ""not a runner"".The idea was criticised as ""silly"" by Labour economic adviser David Blanchflower, in the New Statesman. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the criticisms would be taken on board in the party's policy review.Mr Corbyn floated the idea of banning profitable firms who ""depend on cheap labour for those profits"" from paying dividends to shareholders in a speech earlier this month.Ms Eagle, who heads Labour's National Policy Forum, said companies should be encouraged to act more fairly, but ""a ban on dividends is not the way to do it"".She told The Sunday Times: ""It is an interesting idea, but it does not actually work.""Asked to respond to her comments on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Mr McDonnell said ""that's why it's open for discussion"".The government is set to increase the current minimum wage, which rose to £6.70 an hour last year, to a £9 an hour for over 25s by the end of the decade.It will be rebranded as a National Living Wage, but Labour argues it will still be below the level full time workers need to afford a decent standard of living.Mr McDonnell said he planned to bring in a legally enforceable ""real living wage"" when Labour came to power.""But in the meantime, we want to campaign with shareholders so that they pressurise their companies to abide by a real living wage and I think there is an alliance to be built there,"" he added.Responding to criticism from David Blanchflower, who is a member of Labour's economic advisory panel, Mr McDonnell said ""we will listen to his advice and take it on board"".Mr Blanchflower said the new Labour leadership had to ""learn fast"" about the realities of capitalism and stop suggesting ""silly stuff"" such as the dividends ban.In a separate development, Lord Mandelson has accused Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters of declaring war on ""decent Labour party members"" who do not share their values.He denied there was a civil war going on in the Labour Party but said many of those who back Mr Corbyn are now wondering if he is up to the job.The former minister, who served in government under two Labour prime ministers said he thinks Jeremy Corbyn is ""unsupportable"" by the public, and is failing to put ""fear"" into the Conservatives.Speaking to BBC South West, he said: ""People sense that we just don't have credible policies and certainly not a leader they'd like to see as prime minister.""And certainly if we fight the election in 2020 as we are now then my fear would be that we would face a very disappointing result. ""But there's time to go between now and then. And time for the party to make up his mind what it wants to do.""He added: ""For Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters to turn around and say for people who disagree with them, that they are just Tories, that's not just insulting, that is actually very divisive, and a declaration of war by them on many decent Labour party members who share Labour party values.""

2016-02-02,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-02,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-02,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-02,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4 and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May wil be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-02,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-02,Campaigner Cameron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35476204,"It comprises 17 pages of closely argued legal jargon, diplomatic ambiguity and square brackets. The contents are dismissed by critics as a ""pint-sized package"" that fails to match the prime minister's lofty ambition of fundamental reform. It is a draft text that oozes with the obfuscation of old-style EU fudge. There are paragraphs of compromise that fail to meet the promises of the Conservative manifesto. The newspapers look down sniffily and ask: ""Is that it?"" Tory MPs mutter to one another in the corridors of Westminster, unable to hide their disappointment. One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of ""polishing a poo"". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders. And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain ""better off, more secure, more prosperous"". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the ""best of worlds"" and that was ""something worth fighting for"".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed. But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive. And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat. So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today. And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling. They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month. But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave. It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak. So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal. But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating. In other words, the referendum campaign has begun. "
2016-02-02,EU leaders on board?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35469933,"My first instinct is that this is something everyone can work with.Eastern and Central European countries will continue to complain about the suspension of migrant in-work benefits.They are likely to argue that the EU has sold its principles down the river in an attempt to keep the UK in the EU. They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels. However the government will hope it will sound good in terms of wrestling back powers from Brussels to the UK - and to other EU countries.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumReferendum timeline: What will happen when?Q&A: What does Britain want from Europe?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-02,Analysing Tusk letter,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471117,"David Cameron has hailed a draft EU reform deal as delivering the ""substantial changes"" he wants to see to the UK's relationship with the 28-nation bloc.He says some work is needed to hammer out the details ahead of a crunch summit in Brussels on 18 February.But how does the 16-page letter drawn up by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, measure up to what the prime minister originally wanted from the negotiations?The BBC's chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt gives his verdict while Europe correspondent Chris Morris looks at how the deal will be perceived elsewhere in the EU.What Cameron wanted: Allowing Britain to opt out from the EU's founding ambition to forge an ""ever closer union"" of the peoples of Europe so it will not be drawn into further political integration in a ""formal, legally binding and irreversible way"". Giving greater powers to national parliaments to block EU legislation.What Tusk has offered: ""The references to an ever closer union among the peoples are... compatible with different paths of integration being available for different member states and do not compel all member states to aim for a common destination.""It is recognised that the United Kingdom... is not committed to further political integration into the European Union.""Where reasoned opinions on the non-compliance of a draft union legislative act with the principle of subsidiarity, sent within 12 weeks from the transmission of that draft, represent more than 55% of the votes allocated to the national parliaments, the council presidency will include the item on the agenda of the council for a comprehensive discussion."" Gavin Hewitt: The words ""ever closer union"" stay, but they have been interpreted as not meaning political integration or new powers for the EU. In essence, this is what the government wanted - the EU accepts there are not just different speeds to European integration but countries may have different destinations. What the government did not get was recognition the EU was a union with ""multiple currencies"". Mr Cameron has won inclusion of a ""red-card"" mechanism, a new power. If 55% of national parliaments agree, they could effectively block or veto a commission proposal. The question is how likely is this red card system to be used. A much weaker ""yellow card"" was only used twice. The red-card mechanism depends crucially on building alliances, and the UK has not always been successful at that.In these negotiations, some key areas seem to have been dropped. There will be no repatriation of EU social and employment law, which was a 2010 manifesto commitment. There will be no changes to the working-hours directive. The sceptics will argue that over sovereignty, the UK has not won back control over its affairs.Chris Morris: The idea that different member states will move at different speeds and on ""different paths"" was already widely accepted. Britain won't be in the inner core, but we knew that already. There is also specific language in these draft proposals that encourages the eurozone to integrate further - as most governments accept that it must. The idea of a red card for national parliaments makes a nice headline, but it may not make much difference in practice. It would still be easier to block legislation in the Council of Ministers (threshold 35%) than under the new proposal in which 55% of EU parliaments would have to club together to make an objection. What Cameron wanted: The Conservative manifesto said: ""We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years."" It also proposed a ""new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years"".The manifesto also pledged to ""end the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all"", adding that ""if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leave"".Mr Cameron also wanted to prevent EU migrant workers in the UK sending child benefit or child tax credit money home. ""If an EU migrant's child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid,"" says the Tory manifesto.What Tusk has offered:""[New legislation will] provide for an alert and safeguard mechanism that responds to situations of inflows of workers from other member states of an exceptional magnitude over an extended period of time… the implementing act would authorise the member state to limit the access of union workers newly entering its labour market to in-work benefits for a total of up to four years from the commencement of employment.""Gavin Hewitt: This is the ""emergency brake"" there has been much talk about. If there were excessive strain on the welfare system, in-work benefits could be denied to EU workers for four years. This is, essentially, what Mr Cameron wanted.The government had promised to reduce the numbers of EU migrants and believes the UK's current benefits act as a pull factor. The EU has agreed it would be ""justified"" to trigger an emergency brake without delay after the referendum if the UK votes to stay in the EU. But there are questions here:Mr Cameron has failed in his demand to ban migrant workers from sending child benefit money back home, but they would get a lower level of payments if the cost of living in the country where the child lives is lower.The government has already reached an agreement on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseeker's allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers allowance and housing benefit, for six months. The Tusk letter does not mention changes to social housing entitlement but they were never part of Mr Cameron's preliminary negotiations. Chris Morris: There will still be considerable opposition in Eastern Europe towards anything that smacks of discrimination against their citizens. Little wonder that David Cameron's next stop on his tour of Europe will be a return to Warsaw on Friday. He has some persuading still to do. There is also a lot of detail surrounding the emergency brake proposal that remains vague, and there's likely to be some difficult late night debate ahead. The basic premise - that the UK can treat nationals from other EU countries differently, even if only for a short time - is certainly a departure from the status quo. Other countries may look to take advantage of this as well, and that will make some EU officials nervous.What Cameron wanted: An explicit recognition that the euro is not the only currency of the European Union, to ensure countries outside the eurozone are not materially disadvantaged. He also wanted safeguards that steps to further financial union cannot be imposed on non-eurozone members and the UK will not have to contribute to eurozone bailouts.What Tusk offered: ""Measures, the purpose of which is to further deepen the economic and monetary union, will be voluntary for member states whose currency is not the euro.""Mutual respect between member states participating or not in the operation of the euro area will be ensured.""Legal acts... [between eurozone countries] shall respect the internal market."" Gavin Hewitt: The UK government wanted safeguards that as the eurozone integrated further, it did not take decisions that threatened the essential interests of those outside the eurozone, such as Britain. Key British interests are the single market and the City.Crucially, much of the detail here has not been worked out. It is not clear what rights non-eurozone countries have beyond being consulted and not having to pay for the financial stability of the euro. This could well be a source of friction at the forthcoming summit.Chris Morris: It's just a hunch, but this could still be the issue that has EU leaders haggling into the early hours when they convene for a summit later this month. It threatened to delay the release of Mr Tusk's draft proposals today, as French President Francois Hollande sought assurances that Britain would not hold any kind of veto over eurozone business. Another emergency brake would be deployed here, but it is not entirely clear what would happen if consensus between euro ins and outs proved impossible. This is such an important long-term issue that there may be those who say that further clarity is essential before they can sign up to a final deal. What Cameron wanted: A target for the reduction of the ""burden"" of excessive regulation and extending the single marketWhat Tusk offered: ""The EU must increase efforts towards enhancing competitiveness, along the lines set out in the Declaration of the European Council on competitiveness. To this end the relevant EU institutions and the member states will make all efforts to strengthen the internal market….this means lowering administrative burdens.""Gavin Hewitt: This was the least controversial of the government's demands. The spirit of the times in Brussels is to do less but better. Such statements do not always accord with reality, however. Certainly Mr Cameron has been at the forefront of arguing for less red tape and less regulation on business.Chris Morris: Who doesn't want a more competitive Europe? The question is how best you achieve it.  These proposals envisage a declaration that the EU would work towards greater integration of the single market. But they've said that before, so it doesn't feel all that new. There is also provision for an annual audit of EU regulation with the aim of reducing red tape - but, again, that is already a stated priority of the current European Commission. This feels a little bit like more of the same, but officials argue that it needed clarifying in the context of the EU debate in the UK.

2016-02-02,Canvassing the Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35466853,"Here are ten things about MPs' views about the UK's referendum on whether to stay in or leave the European Union, courtesy of research by the respected political academics Tim Bale, Philip Cowley and Anand Menon.They interviewed 129 MPs, a sample they say is closely representative of Parliament as a whole. So what did those MPs, speaking anonymously, tell them?1) Overwhelmingly, MPs think that the UK will vote to stay in the European Union - that was the response of seven out of 10 of those who spoke to the researchers.But how will MPs themselves vote?2) Half of respondents said they would be voting in favour of remaining in the EU. 11% said they would be voting to leave, but a third said that their views would depend on the terms of the prime minister's renegotiation with Brussels. Among Conservative MPs, 70% either said their vote would be based on the renegotiation, or they didn't know yet how they would vote.So, whilst some say this whole renegotiation malarky is pointless because people will vote on the bigger principle of the UK's place in the world, this research suggests something else: those who are undecided now might be persuadable when a large chunk of MPs (including the prime minister) finally say how they're going to vote, and this could prove decisive. 3) Still not convinced? Take a look at the views of Conservative MPs and Tory party activists. When you compare this study with research into the views of the Tory rank and file, it appears Conservative MPs are slightly more Eurosceptic than their grassroots, but both party members and those at Westminster overwhelmingly say ""lets wait and see what the prime minister gets"". So, on the face of it, the renegotiation does matter to them. Or, perhaps for some, they will want to be loyal to their party leader, and agree with whatever he concludes when the renegotiation is complete. David Cameron is highly likely to advocate staying in the EU - and will probably convince a healthy chunk of Conservative MPs and voters to support him.4) So, given I've claimed there is evidence to suggest this renegotiation does matter, do MPs think David Cameron will achieve very much? The short answer: no. Just 9% of MPs said they expected the negotiations to produce a great deal of change, and 21% expected a ""fair amount"" of change. The majority expected ""not very much"" or no change at all.Therefore, the renegotiation could prove both crucial and, in concrete terms, insubstantial in the view of many.5) How do MPs' views on the EU compare with those of the electorate? By comparing their research with the analysis of others, the academics conclude that Conservative MPs are, on balance, considerably more inclined than voters to believe the UK has not benefited from being a member of the EU. Labour MPs are even more out of line, but in the opposite direction.Tell me more, do I hear you say?6) OK, voters are sceptical about any supposed benefits to the UK of EU members throwing more of their lot in together and integrating, but are nowhere near as sceptical as some Conservative MPs.So, when I say ""European Union,"" what is the first thing that comes into your mind? And what is the first thing that comes into MPs' minds?7) The most referred-to feelings Conservative MPs associate with the EU are ""uneasy"", ""angry"" and ""hopeful."" So not that sunny.8) Labour MPs are positively beaming: ""hopeful"", ""proud"" and ""happy"" are the most popular sentiments from them.9) And what about us lot, the electorate? ""Uneasy"", ""hopeful"" - oh, and ""indifferent"".  Perhaps evidence that the kind of stuff that can obsess Westminster might not mean much to plenty of others. But at least one begs to differ, because....10) ...one MP said they wouldn't be voting in the EU referendum. I wonder who that was?"
2016-02-02,European goals,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35427610,"We know a bit about what politicians and business leaders think about the upcoming referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, but what about the world of football?Would a British exit change the character of the Premier League, which relies so heavily on European players and managers? Or would it give a boost to home-grown talent? As the January transfer window reaches its climax, we asked football experts, the governing bodies and both sides in referendum debate for their views.Football's governing bodies like to stay out of the political spotlight, and they refused to comment when asked if they were for or against the UK's EU membership.But Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore gave an insight into his position last October, in a little reported speech to the Institute of Directors. According to the International Business Times, he said: ""I believe we, in the UK, must be in Europe from a business perspective. I believe in the free movement of goods, but when it comes to services, we must be entitled, especially in the audiovisual world, to territorialism.""By services he meant broadcasting rights, which the Premier League's entire £3.3bn a year business depends on. Scudamore argued that broadcasting rights should be protected by national governments, to protect the Premier League's exports of raw live feeds of games from piracy and copyright infringement.The FA is concerned about the influx of foreign players into the top tier of the English game, which it believes is crowding out young home-grown talent. Working with the Home Office, it has brought in tougher visa restrictions on players from outside the EU, to ensure only established stars can be snapped up by English clubs.The FA declined to comment on whether it would like to see similar restrictions on players from within the EU, which could only come about if Britain left.""The interests of the FA, which is concerned about the future of the England team, and the Premier League, which is concerned with maximising the value of national and international broadcasting rights for the clubs, are far from identical.""If - after Britain left the EU - there was a strict migration quota strictly applied then one would assume that the Home Office would give preference to the thousands of workers needed to keep essential public services going. Footballers and other sports people would not be given priority, except, perhaps, for the absolute stars.""The worst case scenario for the Premier League is that it would not be permitted to attract foreign stars in great numbers and would then lose ground in international sponsorship and broadcasting rights to rivals like Spain and Germany. This would make a minor hole in the UK's invisible exports and tax receipts as well.""While Premier League teams might thus be forced to give more opportunities to home grown English players, it is doubtful whether the growing insularity of English football would actually benefit the England team because of diminished opportunities to play against the very best and to be coached by the very best.""In the end, it will all depend on how British politics evolve after an exit from the EU. If right wing 'Little Englanders' came to power, insisting on the strictest migration quotas, then the international attraction of the Premier League would be significantly reduced.""""British football, its clubs and its fans, are stronger and better off in Europe. ""For clubs, free movement plays a vital role in the transfer marker. Players from the EU can sign for UK clubs without needing a visa or work permit. ""Leaving the EU could have a big impact on foreign players, as a Guardian study has found that around two thirds of Premiership players from the EU would not meet the criteria currently used for non-Europeans to get a work visa automatically. ""Losing this unhindered access to European talent would put British clubs at a disadvantage. FA boss Martin Glenn has said that deteriorating relations between the EU and Britain is one of his 'biggest concerns'.""Fans benefit from Britain's membership of the EU. Europe's single market brings us cheaper flights, making it more affordable to see away games across Europe. Free movement, meanwhile, ensures that British fans don't face visa fees when travelling around Europe. ""But this is not just about the big leagues, it is also about the future of the sport. The EU promotes sport in schools across Europe. Under the Erasmus programme, anyone in Britain with a bright idea for a local football project can get money from the EU to get the ball rolling and make that idea a reality. Britain has received £1.5m in Erasmus sports funding over the past two years. ""Football in our country gains so much from being in Europe. Clubs and fans all benefit from European action, laws and funding. Leaving the EU would hurt our leagues, inconvenience our fans, and be a step back for the next generation of footballers.""""In the dressing room of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, the team tactics are quite clear. Run 'project fear' and scare voters about the prospect of leaving the EU. ""Their latest claims, that football would somehow be damaged by a vote to leave are utter nonsense and should be shown the red card. ""Their claims ignore the fact that outside the EU, we would be free to set our own policy on migration, visas, and work permits to suit our economy and our national game and instead assume we would apply an incredibly restrictive visa regime that literally no-one is arguing for.   ""Right now we are both prevented from implementing policies to nurture domestic talent and from bringing the top footballing talent from right across the globe. That's the worst of all worlds.""The FA has acknowledged the recent restrictions that have been introduced on skilled immigration from non-EU countries are the direct consequence of the EU's freedom of movement rules. ""This has hurt clubs' abilities to bring in players from outside of the EU while preventing any limits from being imposed within the EU. That's not a decision of anyone we elect, that's thanks to the controversial 1995 Bosman ruling in the European Court of Justice. This trade-off has happened across the economy, but what if it didn't have to give up control on players from inside and outside of the EU? ""What if the UK and the FA got to decide who plays in the Premier league from abroad rather than unaccountable and unelected EU judges? That's what would happen if we vote leave. Don't believe the scaremongering to the contrary."" ""Leaving the EU will be of great benefit for British football for it will mean we can lift our horizons to recruit from the rest of the world because it will become easier to introduce footballers from countries outside the EU. ""All we hear is the scaremongering about leaving the EU when the truth is it offers positive opportunities for us and children from poorer nations. Who could be against that?""The freedom of movement for people in the EU comes at the price of heavy restrictions on visas for potential signings from Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia. Once we leave the EU the UK will be free to treat footballers from all countries equally which will broaden the pool of talent for our teams, not reduce it. ""Why should our clubs find it difficult to gain a work permit for a highly talented Moroccan or Nigerian but a Belgian of only average talent is made an easy option. Surely it makes sense to treat everyone equally and let our clubs decide who they want to sign?"" "
2016-02-02,Diplomatic battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20160202215011/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32890895,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron is engaged in intensive diplomacy in Europe to win Britain's partners over to his ambitious plans for EU reform. The UK will hold an in/out referendum on its EU membership by the end of 2017. But what priorities do other EU countries bring to the table? How much overlap with the UK is there? UKMr Cameron's Conservative government sees controlling immigration from the EU as a top priority. Limiting options for EU migrants to claim welfare benefits could make moving to the UK less attractive. Mr Cameron says his main purpose is to eradicate abuse of the system.From 2004 the UK saw a huge surge in migration from Eastern Europe - especially Poland - with EU enlargement.Free movement of people is enshrined as a fundamental right in the EU treaties. It is one of the ""four freedoms"" of the single market - people, goods, services and capital. The European Commission - the EU's executive - says that those freedoms are non-negotiable.Under Mr Cameron's plans, EU migrants new to the UK would not be able to claim in-work benefits, such as tax credits and access to social housing, for four years. The Commission says such a move would be ""highly problematic"", but is considering whether the UK could have an ""emergency brake"" to curb immigration from the EU. The brake might be invoked if the UK could show that migrants were putting too much strain on schools, hospitals and other services.Mr Cameron's other three priorities cover:You can read more about the UK government's EU reform agenda in this Q&A.GermanyEU migrants' welfare claims are certainly a political issue in Germany. The influx of non-EU migrants has put huge pressure on German housing and welfare. A record 1.1 million migrants sought asylum in Germany in 2015.In November 2014 the European Court of Justice backed Germany's right to deny certain benefits to a Romanian woman and her son living in Germany, in the Dano case. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government favours a six-month limit for EU jobseekers, after which they can be expelled from the country, tougher qualification rules for child benefit paid to children living outside Germany and a re-entry ban for welfare fraudsters. That is an agenda similar to Mr Cameron's.But Germany is worried about any UK restrictions on in-work benefits for EU migrants, Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform says.""Germany won't upset the Poles - Germany's relations with Poland are arguably as important as those with the UK,"" he told the BBC.Germany has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe and relies heavily on migrant workers from fellow EU states, many of them Poles.Like the UK Conservatives, the German government is keen to develop the single market. But in the services sector there are some strong vested interests in ""protected"" professions - areas where foreign competitors face high barriers to entry.Germany is one of the strongest advocates of deeper eurozone integration, to bolster the single currency. That has already caused some tensions with the UK.Mrs Merkel wanted a treaty change to enforce new EU-wide budget rules - something that Mr Cameron famously vetoed in December 2011. His veto came after France and Germany had refused to grant a separate ""protocol"" to exempt the City of London from new EU financial service regulations.FranceThere are worries in the French political elite - as in Germany - that Mr Cameron's reform ideas could trigger EU treaty change. That is anathema to President Francois Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, both of whom must fight general elections in 2017.Mr Hollande defends the freedom of movement principle, but there is great concern about immigration in France, particularly after Islamist extremists managed to enter from Belgium undetected last November to murder 130 people in Paris. Mr Hollande's main political rival, conservative ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, is urging reform of the Schengen passport-free travel system. National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen wants barriers to immigration - she totally rejects EU migration policy. So there is some French sympathy for Mr Cameron's demands, though French concerns tend to focus on radicalisation of Muslims in the banlieues (suburbs).French welfare benefits - as in many other EU countries - are mainly insurance-based. The UK's welfare system is more universal - funded out of general taxation. Stephen Booth of the Open Europe think-tank says the UK system makes it harder to change in-work benefits without other Europeans seeing it as discrimination. ""The UK tax credit system doesn't fall neatly into EU definitions of social security,"" he told the BBC.On the single market, France's economic woes have made its politicians more open to liberalisation, and that is happening in some sectors, albeit slowly. Prime Minister Manuel Valls is seen as pro-business and there is French support for creating a capital markets union, so that businesses can turn to financial services other than banks for loans.But France remains hostile to British calls for cuts in agricultural spending.The NetherlandsFree trade lies at the heart of the Dutch commitment to the EU, so in that respect the Dutch position is very close to the UK's.The Dutch government presented EU reform proposals in 2013 which called for less EU regulation, in language similar to Mr Cameron's. They opposed further EU attempts to harmonise social security systems.And the proposals said ""ever closer union"" should not be a general ambition. EU leaders have already started addressing UK concerns on that score. Their summit conclusions in June 2014 said: ""The concept of ever closer union allows for different paths of integration for different countries, allowing those that want to deepen integration to move ahead, while respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further.""The Netherlands supports UK calls to reform the EU's structural funds - big allocations to the EU's poorest regions, which are managed from Brussels. The idea is to end the bureaucratic procedure whereby net contributors to the EU budget send money to Brussels, only for it to be returned in the form of structural funds.Italy Italy is on the frontline of the EU's migration crisis in the Mediterranean and has played a key role in shaping the response to it.Facing unprecedented boatloads of migrants fleeing turmoil in Libya, Italy urged its EU partners to share the burden of housing them and processing asylum claims. That EU burden-sharing is going very slowly - and Greece is now the most urgent challenge. Syrian refugees are the biggest group among thousands of migrants who sail to Greek islands daily from Turkey. The UK has sent naval help to the Mediterranean, but it wants the EU to focus more on smashing people-smuggling networks and stopping the migrants before they reach Libya or Turkey.With its low birth rate Italy faces a big demographic challenge, like Germany, so it does not want measures that could discriminate against EU migrants. Many Italians also work elsewhere in the EU.UK ideas for boosting the single market and competitiveness could however win support in Italy, as its economy is fragile.PolandPolish leaders dislike Mr Cameron's plans on migrant benefits, fearing that they might discriminate against many Polish citizens living in the UK. In recent years more than 800,000 Poles have settled in the UK.However, the new right-wing Polish government is likely to be sympathetic to UK concerns about sovereignty.European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is playing a key role in the UK negotiations.On the euro, both countries worry about a eurozone ""inner club"" developing. Poland is treaty-bound to join the euro in future - unlike the UK. But it is equally concerned to protect its voting rights in economic policy.Poland and other former communist countries want more of the EU budget to be spent in their region, so that they can catch up with the older EU member states. They object to the British budget rebate, which was worth €5.3bn (£3.7bn; $5.8bn) to the UK in 2014.SwedenSweden is often seen as one of the UK's natural allies in Europe, sharing the UK enthusiasm for free trade and the business opportunities in the single market.And like the UK it has stayed out of the euro - though it does not have a treaty opt-out.Immigration has become a thorny issue in Sweden too.Like Mr Cameron, Sweden is keen to lessen the EU's regulatory burden, but it puts more emphasis on protecting workers' rights and promoting the green economy.Mr Cameron can rely on Swedish support for completing the EU single market and reforming the EU budget to help give Europe more economic clout globally.The Swedish parliament is one of the most pro-active in scrutinising EU legislation and in using the ""yellow card"" system, whereby several parliaments acting together can send EU laws back to Brussels for revision. That also brings Sweden closer to the UK Conservatives' agenda."

2016-02-03,PM defends EU deal from critics,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35479506,"David Cameron has mounted a defence of his EU reform deal after it was questioned in the Commons by London Mayor Boris Johnson.Mr Johnson asked how the package would restore UK sovereignty and curb EU regulations - having earlier said the PM was ""making the best of a bad job"".The PM said it would make Britain ""stronger and better"".And in an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he denied having compromised over welfare curbs.The prime minister faced two hours of questions from MPs on the draft agreement unveiled by the EU which paves the way for the UK's in/out referendum.Responding to Mr Johnson, he jabbed his finger on the despatch box to emphasise his point, telling his Conservative colleague: ""I am not saying this is perfect, I am not saying the European Union will be perfect after this deal - it certainly won't be - but will the British position be stronger and better? Yes it will.""In his answer, the prime minister also said he would introduce measures to put the UK Parliament's sovereignty ""beyond doubt"" at the same time as he concludes his EU negotiations.BBC deputy political editor James Landale said this suggested how the PM might attempt to persuade Mr Johnson to back the campaign to remain in the EU.The London mayor has previously argued that it would be better if Britain was able to block EU laws on its own, without having to rely on the support of other member states.Asked before the debate about whether he supported Mr Cameron's reforms, he said the PM was making ""the best of a bad job"".But he added: ""Most people looking at this will think there's a lot more to do.""Mr Cameron is aiming to get agreement from all member states at a summit in Brussels in a fortnight, paving the way for a referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EU in June.He told MPs the details would need to be pinned down during the course of the ""intense"" round of negotiations - but the draft deal hammered out with top EU officials was the strongest ever achieved on freedom of movement rules.The prime minister urged Tory MPs to vote ""with their hearts"" based on what they believed was right for Britain and not what ""might be advantageous"" to them personally.That did not stop Eurosceptic Tory MPs lined up to criticise it, with Jacob Rees-Mogg saying Mr Cameron had two weeks to salvage his reputation as a negotiator after serving up ""thin gruel"" which had been further watered down.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party wanted the UK to remain in the EU but he dismissed the prime minister's renegotiations as a ""smoke and mirrors sideshow"" and said he had ""ended up exactly where he knew he would be, making the case to remain in Europe"".In a separate development, the first ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to Mr Cameron calling on him not to hold the EU referendum in June. In a joint letter Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness warn that with elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in May, a referendum campaign running at the same time ""risks confusing issues at a moment when clarity is required."" They also say it would make it ""virtually impossible"" for political parties in these areas to work together on the referendum campaign while their own elections are in progress. Alan Johnson, who is leading Labour's remain campaign, has said he will not oppose a June referendum.At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron insisted voters would be ""perfectly capable"" of coping with two separate ballots.Downing Street says ministers have agreed not to challenge Mr Cameron until he has secured a final deal at a summit in Brussels in a fortnight.But the BBC understands several Eurosceptic ministers - including Commons leader Chris Grayling - are discussing whether to break ranks before Mr Cameron announces the date of a referendum.Former defence secretary Liam Fox said he was ""certain"" four or five cabinet ministers would eventually join the campaign to leave, adding that the offer on the table meant that ""what we can get, at best, is better membership of the wrong club"".Home Secretary Theresa May - who is on the list of Conservative big names the out campaign want to recruit - released a statement on Tuesday saying the reform proposals provided ""a basis for a deal"". She said it was ""encouraging"" that key UK concerns about the ""abuse"" of EU free movement rules and the use of European law to block the deportation of foreign criminals were being addressed.UKIP leader Nigel Farage has, meanwhile, told MEPs Mr Cameron's deal was ""hardly worth the wait"" and ""really rather pathetic"", adding that it had ""no treaty change, no powers returned, and no control of our borders"". But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker talked up the draft deal in a speech to the European Parliament, saying: ""The settlement recognises this - it recognises that if the United Kingdom considered that it is now at the limit of its level of integration then that is fine. ""At the same time it makes clear that other member states can move towards a deeper degree of integration as they see fit. In this way we have addressed the prime minister's concern while respecting the treaties.""The draft deal includes an ""emergency brake"" to restrict in-work benefits for EU migrants. But it would have to be agreed by other EU nations and it would be ""graduated"", with more money from tax credits paid to migrants the longer they remain in the UK. The draft says Mr Cameron's demand to exempt Britain from the EU principle of ""ever closer union"" between member states would be written into a future treaty, and there are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations.After weeks of speculation about David Cameron's talks over the UK's relationship with Brussels, the papers finally get to assess the full package of proposed reforms.""EU chief Donald Tusk saw him coming,"" the Sun says. The Daily Express is also scathing saying: ""The only good thing that can be said for his efforts is that they clear the way for a referendum this summer. We say bring it on.""The Mirror argues there is a ""good case"" for Britain staying in the EU but that Mr Cameron ""isn't communicating it when he's more interested in presentation than substance"".But the PM wins support from the Financial Times, which says: ""For all the criticism, Mr Cameron looks set to secure a reasonable deal for Britain. In each of the areas where he has sought reform, the prime minister has made tangible progress"".Newspaper review in full: Deal or no deal?"

2016-02-03,First ministers urge EU referendum delay,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35483522,"The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged David Cameron not to hold an EU referendum in June, saying it will ""distract"" from devolved elections taking place in May.Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones and Arlene Foster have written to the PM to urge him to defer the date.They say a June date will ""confuse"" the process and make it hard for them to campaign effectively in the referendum.Mr Cameron told MPs that voters were able to differentiate between polls.David Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum by the end of 2017 but said he wants to get on with it and is reported to favour a poll on 23 June.However, the exact timing hinges on whether EU leaders agree to the draft package of reforms published on Tuesday at a summit next month, which would pave the way for a poll at the end of June. In their letter, also signed by Northern Ireland deputy first minister Martin McGuinness, the three political leaders say it is vital that voters are properly informed about the issue at stake in the referendum and this could be compromised if the campaign overlaps with that for elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Stormont Parliament on 5 May.""We believe that holding a referendum as early as June will mean that a significant part of the referendum campaign will necessarily run in parallel with those elections and risks confusing issues at a moment when clarity is required,"" they write.Analysis by Nick Eardley, BBC Scotland's Westminster correspondentOpposition in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to an early referendum has been building in recent weeks.There is concern that a date just weeks after the 5 May election would mean the campaigns become confused or there wouldn't be time to properly consider the European issue. It is interesting to note the Labour Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones has signed this letter. Nationally his party favours a June vote - Alan Johnson, the leader of the Labour In campaign said yesterday his party would not stand in the way of a 23 June referendum. And last night, Scottish Labour's leader Kezia Dugdale told BBC Scotland she was happy for the vote to be held then.But expect continued pressure from devolved governments and administrations on this issue. Even if David Cameron can persuade other European leaders of his renegotiation plans, it's possible he will face significant opposition domestically on the date. ""Furthermore, it will be virtually impossible for the political parties in our respective territories to plan effectively for, and where appropriate work together on, the referendum campaign while our own elections are in progress. ""We believe that the European Referendum is of vital importance to the future of the whole United Kingdom and the debate leading up to it should, therefore, be free of other campaigning distraction.""Raising the letter during Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Angus Robertson said the PM should show ""respect"" for the voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and make a commitment not to hold the poll in June.Mr Cameron said no date had been agreed but he could guarantee that the referendum would not be held within six weeks of devolved elections, which he claimed had been asked for by former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond. ""I respect the electorates of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis that I think people are perfectly able of making up their minds in a local election or Scottish Parliamentary election and then a period of some weeks later making up their mind all over again on the vital question of the European Union,"" he said.""No date has been fixed and there must be a six-week gap but, frankly, I think he is looking for things to complain about."""
2016-02-03,Universal Credit 'leaves people poorer',https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35475350,"The introduction of Universal Credit (UC) will leave working families worse off on average, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said.UC, which combines six benefits into one monthly payment, was intended to be more generous than the current system but the IFS said cuts to the programme meant this would not be the case.But it said UC would encourage people into work and save £2.7bn a year.Ministers said the IFS had ignored other benefits such as extra childcare.Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).According to the IFS research, an estimated 2.1 million families will face an average loss of £1,600 a year, while 1.8 million will gain an average of £1,500.Its figures suggest 1.1 million homes with no-one in paid work will lose out by about £2,300 a year, while 500,000 are expected to gain of £1,000. Working single parents are said to face an annual loss of £1,000.The new payments system still only affects a minority of claimants, but it is gradually being rolled out across the country.Robert Joyce, the author of the IFS report, added: ""The potential gains from simplifying the working-age benefit system remain mostly intact: Universal Credit should make the system easier to understand, ease transitions into and out of work, and largely get rid of the most extreme disincentives to work or to earn more created by the current system.""The government has always said that Universal Credit (UC) would encourage more people to find work.The IFS said that was true for most people, but not all.It said that single parents, for example, had less of an incentive to work under UC than under the old system.Where couples are concerned, UC encourages just one of them to find employment, rather than both, the IFS claimed.Single parents claiming UC will keep 8% less of their earnings than previously, its figures suggest.Although Chancellor George Osborne abandoned cuts to tax credits in the Autumn, cuts to UC announced last summer will still go ahead.From this April the amount that anyone on UC can earn before their benefits are cut will be reduced.This so-called Work Allowance will be £4,764 for those not claiming for housing costs, or £2,304 for those who do.Once claimants earn above that amount, they lose 65p for every pound they are paid.From April 2017, parents making new UC claims will only be able to take their first two children into account, while the first child premium will be abolished.Separately, a committee of MPs has also complained that UC is getting further and further behind schedule.The Public Accounts Committee report accused the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of being ""evasive"" when asked about the delays.But the DWP said that the programme was being rolled out ""safely and securely"" and would be completed by March 2021.The overhaul of the welfare system has been driven by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who argued that too many people were trapped on benefits. But shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said Mr Duncan Smith's claims were ""in tatters"". He said ""everyone can now see that successive cuts to Universal Credit have destroyed many of the work incentives that were supposed to be the very reason for the scheme, hitting single parents particularly hard"".The government has always said that no individuals will lose money as a result of the changes. New claimants for UC will also be helped by transitional support.And a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Universal Credit will make work pay and increase financial incentives for people to work more, while also bringing the welfare bill under control.""He added: ""Universal Credit also includes a wide range of additional benefits - including increased childcare and more support from a dedicated work coach both things that were ignored in the IFS's analysis."""
2016-02-03,Benefit brake 'to address UK concerns',https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35481923,"Limiting in-work benefits to new EU arrivals will help tackle the effects of record migration to the UK since 2004, the EC's president has said.Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would ""address the consequences"" of that.But he said the emergency brake would only apply in ""exceptional cases"".Eurosceptics say it is ineffectual and could make the situation worse.Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a ""handbrake turn"" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive ""graduated"" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that.They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally. Defending the proposals and the rest of the draft deal in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the entire package - which must be approved by the EU as a whole, was ""fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states"".On welfare, he said: ""We propose to create a safeguard mechanism tailor-made to the concerns of the UK, that would allow it to restrict the excess of EU workers newly entering its Labour market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years.""The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time - that is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary to make it compatible with the (EU) treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.""Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so.One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK. Mr Juncker said ""as a result"" of that decision ""over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens"". He added. ""In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision.""But UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015.""We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn.""Mr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between ""vested self-interests and people power"".Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China.""I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest,"" he claimed. ""We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States.""It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe."""
2016-02-03,Devolution bill attacks 'ill-informed',https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-35476460,"Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has hit back at his critics over plans to rewrite the devolution settlement.He told MPs much of the criticism of UK ministers' draft Wales Bill was ""ill-informed or just plain wrong"".But First Minister Carwyn Jones said Mr Crabb wanted a ""political row to hide his embarrassment"" over criticism of the proposals.Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith said Labour would not back the ""badly flawed"" bill without radical changes.She told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme: ""As the bill stands at the moment, we cannot back it as it would mean turning the clock back, meaning that some of the things the assembly has done to date would not be possible and it would end up in the courts time, after time, after time.""The new laws would give Welsh ministers more power in some areas, let the assembly call itself a parliament and decide its own election rules.It would also scrap the requirement to hold a referendum before Wales gets some control over income tax powers.The bill aims to set out more clearly which powers are reserved to Westminster, but opposition politicians and academics say it could lead to a reversal of devolution and give UK ministers a ""veto"" over Welsh decisions.Defending his plans, Mr Crabb told a meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee on Wednesday: ""There is no 'English veto' and there is no 'roll-back' - the bill actually strikes the right balance.""The Welsh secretary conceded there were ""elements of the bill"" that would need to change, but warned that ""when the first minister keeps moving the goalposts and shifting his own position it makes negotiation very difficult"".He accused Mr Jones of being ""in the same camp"" as Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood ""arguing for a devolution settlement that undermines the role and legitimacy of UK government"". Suggesting he fears Mr Jones has ""given up on the Union"", the Welsh secretary added: ""It is absurd for Welsh government to be arguing for a devolution framework which not only gives them free rein in devolved areas but also total freedom to block and interfere in decisions by UK ministers.""Responding, Mr Jones said Mr Crabb ""wants to have a political row to hide his embarrassment over the recent criticism of his draft Wales Bill"" but he was going to ""disappoint him"". ""He knows our views. He knows the views of the entire National Assembly for Wales, including the Conservative group, who by his own logic are now in favour of independence. ""He knows the views of every constitutional expert who has looked at the draft bill."" The first minister urged Mr Crabb to stop ""throwing stones and buckle down to the hard task of actually fulfilling the promise his prime minister made to the people of Wales"" on Welsh devolution.Liberal Democrat peer Lord German told the BBC's Wales Report programme the principle of the draft bill was ""absolutely right"", but UK ministers had a ""job to do to make sure the legislation is clearer""."
2016-02-03,PM to visit NI to campaign for EU place,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-35481946,"Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to visit Northern Ireland to explain why he believes the UK will be better off remaining in a reformed EU.But Northern Ireland's first minister has said it looks like her Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will campaign for the UK to leave the European Union.Arlene Foster said she was disappointed by the deal between the prime minister and EU officials on UK's membership.She said she will wait until talks end before making a final decision.However, Mrs Foster has joined the first ministers in Scotland and Wales in asking Mr Cameron not to hold the EU referendum in June.She has signed a joint letter with Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones.Their letter to Mr Cameron warns that with elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in May, an EU referendum campaign running at the same time ""risks confusing issues at a moment when clarity is required"".Mrs Foster told the BBC it would subsume the issues surrounding May's Stormont Assembly vote.Regarding her own party's position on EU membership, she said: ""Given where we are today, it looks very much as if we will be on the coming out of Europe side.""We are a Eurosceptic party and it certainly looks as if we're not going to get a deal which will bring any fundamental reforms in respect of our relationship with the European Union.""In the House of Commons on Wednesday, the prime minister dealt with questions from unionist MPs concerned about the cost of the UK's EU membership and concerns from Irish nationalists about the impact any withdrawal from the EU may have on cross-border relations on the island of Ireland.South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, from the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) asked for a guarantee that the free movement of people across Ireland would continue in the event of a UK withdrawal from the EU.Mr Cameron said he believed this would be addressed. DUP MP Sammy Wilson challenged the prime minister to visit what he called Northern Ireland's ""devastated fishing villages"" and talk to others angered by the EU's policies."
2016-02-03,Public 'not told' about council powers,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35479059,"Councils in England must do a better job of telling residents about new powers they are being given by Whitehall, MPs have said.The government's ""devolution revolution"" to councils includes housing, transport and planning. The Communities and Local Government Committee welcomed the policy but said there was a ""significant lack of public consultation"" in the process.Councils said they recognised the ""need for greater public engagement"". Greater Manchester has been at the forefront of the government's move to devolve powers and spending controls to local government through a series of ""deals"" with each area.Chancellor George Osborne has hailed Manchester's deal as creating a ""Northern Powerhouse"", and similar agreements have been struck with other regions in England, which have to adopt ministers' preferred model of an elected mayor in return.The committee said it strongly supported the principle of devolution, saying the current deals ""should be the starting point, not the destination"". But the MPs, who held a public evidence session in Greater Manchester as part of their inquiry, also said many people had complained about a lack of consultation.""The vast majority of contributions, often made in angry tones, arose from the perceived lack of efforts by the combined authority to engage the public about the deal relating to their local area,"" the committee said.""For devolution to take root and fulfil its aims, it needs to involve and engage the people it is designed to benefit. There has been a consistent very significant lack of public consultation, engagement and communication at all stages of the deal-making process.""Council leaders from other parts of the country told the committee the public had not been consulted before their deals were agreed.It is particularly important to engage the public where health powers are being devolved, the MPs said, because ""the public's response is likely to be more emotional"".The committee said the government had driven the first wave of devolution deals through ""at rapid pace"", which meant ""no opportunity for engagement with residents"", but said council leaders should still have communicated the deal to residents and told them how they would be affected.The Department for Communities and Local Government said it welcomed the committee's support for its ""devolution revolution"" and said there was ""no one-size-fits-all approach"" for different areas.Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said: ""While it is right that devolution deals are not imposed, but negotiated and secured by local places, we recognise the need for greater public engagement throughout the deal-making process and are working with councils to support them in this."""
2016-02-03,Holyrood rejects income tax rise calls,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35479646,"MSPs have rejected plans for income tax rates to increase by 1p in Scotland from April of this year. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had said the move would raise £500m to safeguard education and other public services. But Finance Secretary John Swinney said increasing income tax would punish Scotland's lowest-paid workers. He has vowed to keep income tax rates the same as the rest of the UK for the time being.Mr Swinney was speaking as MSPs debated his draft budget for the forthcoming financial year, which marks the first time Holyrood ministers have been required to play a part in determining income tax rates in Scotland.MSPs backed the general principles of his budget and rejected a Labour amendment calling for the new Scottish Rate of Income Tax to be set at 11p - a penny higher than the rest of the UK across all bands. Speaking at the start of the budget debate, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government's longer-term financial decisions were influenced by the expectation of further powers, including over income tax rates and bands, being devolved under the Scotland Bill which is currently going through the UK Parliament. He added that his budget was aimed at delivering a ""strong and sustainable economy"" while tackling economic inequality.Mr Swinney said: ""The limited nature of the income tax power currently available to the Scottish Parliament only allows for a single rate to be set and then applied to all three income tax bands. ""This means that any increase on the wealthiest would also apply to the lowest income tax payers. Proposals from other parties to increase income tax by 1p next year will hit those tax payers least able to pay.""Mr Swinney also said that the ""last thing he was going to do"" was put up taxes for teachers and public service workers who have ""had to endure pay constraints because of the austerity programme of the United Kingdom government. He added: ""The uprating of the living wage, its extension to social care workers and an uplift of £400 for those covered by public sector pay policy earning £22,000 or less will see tens of thousands better off because of this budget.""Scottish Labour had tabled an amendment to the budget, calling for the Scottish rate of income tax to be set at 11p, a penny more than the rate proposed by the SNP administration.Labour argued that this cash would help avoid cuts to schools and other local public services.The party's finance spokeswoman, Jackie Baillie, told the Holyrood chamber that teachers were ""doing their own photocopying, buying jotters for the classroom - there are no resources in our classrooms"".Ms Baillie said these teachers ""absolutely understand"" the calls for income tax to be raised in order to defend education budgets, and pointed out that her party had proposed a £100 rebate for the lowest-paid workers.She claimed Mr Swinney's budget was ""austerity on stilts"", but told him: ""It is not too late for the SNP - we could work together to end Tory austerity in Scotland. ""You used to want to do so - to invest in our children, to invest in our economy, to invest in our future.""For all his noise, he [Mr Swinney] knows how painful these cuts are, and he knows he doesn't have to do this.""Labour's plans for a 1p rise in income tax were unveiled days after the Scottish Liberal Democrats proposed increasing the levy to help fund education.Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Mr Swinney now had the powers to ""do something about"" austerity, but had refused to use them.Mr Rennie added: ""He is imposing the kind of budget that he has previously condemned.""The people of Scotland will know that his refusal to act means that every single cut to public services in Scotland is a John Swinney cut. He cannot point anywhere else any more."" Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives pledged to resist any increase in taxes, and said Mr Swinney was right to keep income tax rates at their current levels. But he added: ""We know the Scottish government will always complain it does not have enough money, and we know they will always put the blame for this at Westminster's door. ""The difference in this budget is that the finance secretary could have made the choice, if he wished, to increase taxation and he chose not to do so.""Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens credited both Labour and the Liberal Democrats for recognising that revenue would need to be raised in order to protect public services. He added: ""Simply managing cuts from Westminster and blaming the UK government - which is, to be fair, culpable for the deeply wring and damaging actions it is taking - is not enough.""We have to know what to do about it and raising revenue is going to be an important part of the response"".MSPs voted to back the general principles of the Budget Bill by 63 to 46, with 15 abstentions.The amendment from Labour, calling for the Scottish rate of income tax to be set at 11p for 2016-17, was defeated by 81 votes to 43."
2016-02-03,Minister 'confident' over funding deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35478408,"The Scotland Bill's passage through the House of Lords has been delayed while wrangling over the fiscal framework continues. Peers were due to resume line-by-line scrutiny on 9 February but that has now been put back until 22 February.The Scottish government wants a deal concluded by 12 February to allow time for it to be examined at Holyrood. Scottish Secretary David Mundell has informed Holyrood's Devolution Committee of the delay.The negotiations on the fiscal framework - the financial arrangements underpinning the transfer of new powers to the Scottish Parliament - have proved both protracted and complicated. The Scottish government has said there is still ""some distance to go"" before a deal can be agreed and threatened to veto any formula that was ""unfair to Scotland"".First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned recently that Scotland stood to lose billions of pounds over the next few years under the Treasury's current proposals.Talks between the two governments are due to resume in Edinburgh on Monday. In a letter to Holyrood's Devolution Committee, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""The fiscal framework talks are continuing, and I am optimistic about the process. I am doing everything I can to secure an agreement which is durable and fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK.""All through the process we have made time for these issues to be properly considered and discussed, and that remains the case.""I want to ensure both the Scottish Parliament and the House of Lords have as much information as possible for their consideration. It has been agreed, therefore, that the next parliamentary stage of the Scotland Bill will be rescheduled. ""This will allow more time for negotiations between the Scottish and UK Governments to progress. I am confident both parliaments will have the opportunity to properly consider the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework before the Scottish Parliament's dissolution on March 23.""Deputy First Minister John Swinney responded to Mr Mundell's letter, promising the Scottish government would do ""all we can"" to secure an agreement.But he added: ""We will not sign up to any proposed agreement which short changes Scotland by locking in long-term cuts to our budget.""We are working to a deadline of February 12th for talks to be concluded because the Scottish Parliament requested this, as members need time to properly scrutinise and vote on an agreed fiscal framework package before it is dissolved next month ahead of May's election - but we will give all the time possible to secure a deal.""Earlier the Treasury minister negotiating on behalf of the UK government said he was ""confident"" a deal would be reached. Greg Hands said he had cleared his diary for a full day of talks in Edinburgh next Monday and he remained ""upbeat"" that an agreement would be struck. What is the fiscal framework?He told the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee: ""I'm ready to deal. I'm off to Edinburgh on Monday and I remain upbeat on that possibility.""The UK government remains committed to getting that deal.""An agreement would set out how Scotland's annual block grant from the Treasury will be adjusted to take account of the new tax powers.Mr Hands insisted the proposals will provide ""huge new opportunities"" for the Scottish government to grow the economy.The deal must be ""fair to taxpayers in Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK"", he told the committee.Mr Hands said: ""Neither Scotland nor the rest of the UK should be better or worse off as result of the initial act of devolution. ""Thereafter, the Scottish government should bear the fruit of good policy decisions and the consequences of poor policy decisions.""The committee chairman, SNP MP Pete Wishart, warned that Mr Hands and Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney appeared to have ""very different perspectives"" on the long-running negotiations.""There does seem to be some distance to go in terms of getting an agreement on this,"" Mr Wishart said. Scottish Labour had earlier called for the 12 February deadline to be abandoned, and said neither side should walk away until a deal is reached. The party has criticised a lack of transparency in negotiations and called on minutes of meetings to be published. Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: ""Over the past few days we have seen the negotiations descend into a blame game. ""People across Scotland will not understand that after the negotiation for more powers, this deal could fall apart at the last minute."""
2016-02-03,Councils to get Sunday trading powers,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35475935,"Ministers are to press ahead with plans to allow councils in England and Wales to relax Sunday trading laws.Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the move would allow local authorities to ""help struggling High Streets"".He told MPs the policy, previously reported to be facing strong opposition in the Commons, would be added to the government's Enterprise Bill.Unions said ministers were ""behaving disgracefully by trying to change Sunday trading by the back door"".Devolving Sunday trading laws to councils was first announced by George Osborne in the July Budget, and a consultation into the change closed in September.Small shops - up to 280 sq m -  are currently entitled to open when they want, but on Sundays, larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00.In the Commons, Mr Javid's Labour shadow Angela Eagle criticised the way the government was seeking to make the change and as well as what she said was a lack of detail.She accused Mr Javid of a ""gross abuse of power"" asking why the plans were being added ""at this late stage"" rather than being in the Bill from the start.Mr Javid said the government's intentions ""have been clear"" and said amending the Enterprise Bill, which is currently making its way through the Commons, was ""the right vehicle to make those changes"".He told MPs the decision to change Sunday trading hours would be ""entirely local"", adding: ""If the people of Bromsgrove or Barking say they want to see longer Sunday opening hours, who are we here in Westminster to stand in their way?""Under the proposals, local authorities will be able to restrict the longer hours to certain zones - such as High Streets and city centres, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said.It promised that shop workers who wanted to ""opt out"" of working on Sundays would be able to do so, for example on religious or family grounds.The response to the consultation would be published ""shortly"", the government said.Retail union Usdaw said MPs should be able to ""properly consider"" the views expressed in the consultation.General secretary John Hannett  described the current Sunday Trading Act as a ""great British compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years and gives everyone a little bit of what they want.""Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work; whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shop workers can spend some time with their family."""
2016-02-03,UKIP members to set candidate rankings,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-35470132,"UKIP members will decide the final rankings of regional candidates for May's assembly elections after a row within the party.Some local UKIP branches have raised concerns candidates from outside Wales would be imposed on them.UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said the decision to give party members the final say was ""a great victory"".Former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless will be among the names under consideration.There have been allegations of splits within the party's top ranks over the issue.In January, UKIP councillor Kevin Mahoney said he would quit the party if Mr Hamilton, Mr Reckless and Alexandra Phillips, UKIP's head of media in Wales, were selected on the regional lists. Opinion polls suggest UKIP is likely to win seats in the assembly for the first time at May's elections.Applications to be regional candidates are narrowed down to a shortlist. Party members then decide the order that those candidates are listed for the four seats in each of the assembly's five regions.Mr Gill told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's gone back to the grassroots, it's gone back to the membership. We have had a great victory here.""I think it's up to the members to decide for themselves who they want to represent UKIP in Wales.""UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""I have long argued that the UKIP members in Wales should get the final say on who represents our party in the Welsh assembly elections.""These elections in May are our best opportunity to make a breakthrough into UK domestic politics.""This is the first time Nathan Gill has spoken publicly about his ""big battle"" with the party's national executive committee over the selection of regional candidates.It's difficult to argue with a system that means local party members will have the final say over who tops the regional list.If Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are as unpopular with local party members as some have been saying, then presumably they won't be anywhere near the top of the list.Nathan Gill has been claiming victory. But bearing in mind this is a party that likes to take the moral high-ground in being above all a grassroots organisation, is it a battle it should have been having in the first place?Behind the scenes, this has been a damaging row internally for UKIP in Wales. The party will be hoping the decision will heal some of those divisions."
2016-02-03,'Plebgate' officer denies misconduct,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35473743,"A police officer thanked Andrew Mitchell for his ""candour"" at a meeting to discuss the ""plebgate"" row, but the following day told a radio station he had been evasive, a tribunal has heard. Det Sgt Stuart Hinton and two other Police Federation representatives met the Tory MP in October 2012, weeks after the Downing Street incident.The next day, he told the BBC the MP should resign for not fully explaining.The officer denies breaching police standards on honesty.The ""plebgate"" row centred on a 15-second confrontation in September 2012 between Mr Mitchell and PC Toby Rowland, in which - according to the Sun newspaper -  the then Conservative chief whip called the officer a ""pleb"" for his refusal to permit him to cycle through the main gates at Downing Street.Opening a gross misconduct case against Det Sgt Hinton, Aaron Rathmell said a recording of the meeting, which was played to the tribunal, showed the MP had admitted to swearing at a police officer during an exchange at the gates of Downing Street but denied calling him a ""pleb"". The recording also revealed that during the meeting Det Sgt Hinton praised Mr Mitchell for his ""candour"" after the MP told them what happened and said he was ""profoundly and deeply sorry"". Following the meeting, serving Warwickshire Police officer Det Sgt Hinton made comments, in an interview on BBC Radio Five Live on 13 October, about what was said at that meeting. The tribunal is considering whether these remarks were deliberately misleading.Mr Rathmell told the tribunal: ""Mr Hinton appeared on BBC radio and commented: ""He (Mr Mitchell) still won't say exactly what he did say, which suggests that the officer's account is more likely to be the accurate one."" Mr Rathmell said Det Sgt Hinton made these comments despite the fact he seemed satisfied with the answers he heard in the meeting, telling Mr Mitchell ""I appreciate your candour"" and later ""everybody can have a bad day"".Det Sgt Hinton and two colleagues from neighbouring forces had used the meeting ""as a springboard"" for a publicity campaign against government spending cuts, Mr Rathmell said. He added: ""The key controversy in this case surrounds exercising of judgment as to whether Sgt Hinton gave a misleading account regarding the meeting with Mr Mitchell, rather than facts or witnesses' statements being in dispute.""Mr Mitchell was forced to resign from the cabinet over the ""plebgate"" row but vowed to clear his name in the libel courts, launching an action against the Sun. But a judge ruled in 2014 that the MP probably had called PC Rowland a ""pleb"", and Mr Mitchell was ordered to pay damages as well as the Sun's legal costs.The misconduct panel is being held at the Warwickshire Police headquarters to hear an allegation the officer breached the force's professional standards of honesty, integrity and conduct.Det Sgt Hinton, who was secretary of the local Police Federation branch at the time, denies any wrongdoing.The hearing, which is scheduled for up to three days, continues."

2016-02-03,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-03,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-03,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-03,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-03,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-03,Campaigner Cameron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35476204,"It comprises 17 pages of closely argued legal jargon, diplomatic ambiguity and square brackets. The contents are dismissed by critics as a ""pint-sized package"" that fails to match the prime minister's lofty ambition of fundamental reform. It is a draft text that oozes with the obfuscation of old-style EU fudge. There are paragraphs of compromise that fail to meet the promises of the Conservative manifesto. The newspapers look down sniffily and ask: ""Is that it?"" Tory MPs mutter to one another in the corridors of Westminster, unable to hide their disappointment. One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of ""polishing a poo"". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders. And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain ""better off, more secure, more prosperous"". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the ""best of worlds"" and that was ""something worth fighting for"".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed. But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive. And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat. So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today. And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling. They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month. But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave. It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak. So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal. But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating. In other words, the referendum campaign has begun. "
2016-02-03,EU leaders on board?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35469933,"My first instinct is that this is something everyone can work with.Eastern and Central European countries will continue to complain about the suspension of migrant in-work benefits.They are likely to argue that the EU has sold its principles down the river in an attempt to keep the UK in the EU. They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels. However the government will hope it will sound good in terms of wrestling back powers from Brussels to the UK - and to other EU countries.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumReferendum timeline: What will happen when?Q&A: What does Britain want from Europe?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-03,Analysing Tusk letter,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471117,"David Cameron has hailed a draft EU reform deal as delivering the ""substantial changes"" he wants to see to the UK's relationship with the 28-nation bloc.He says some work is needed to hammer out the details ahead of a crunch summit in Brussels on 18 February.But how does the 16-page letter drawn up by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, measure up to what the prime minister originally wanted from the negotiations?The BBC's chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt gives his verdict while Europe correspondent Chris Morris looks at how the deal will be perceived elsewhere in the EU.What Cameron wanted: Allowing Britain to opt out from the EU's founding ambition to forge an ""ever closer union"" of the peoples of Europe so it will not be drawn into further political integration in a ""formal, legally binding and irreversible way"". Giving greater powers to national parliaments to block EU legislation.What Tusk has offered: ""The references to an ever closer union among the peoples are... compatible with different paths of integration being available for different member states and do not compel all member states to aim for a common destination.""It is recognised that the United Kingdom... is not committed to further political integration into the European Union.""Where reasoned opinions on the non-compliance of a draft union legislative act with the principle of subsidiarity, sent within 12 weeks from the transmission of that draft, represent more than 55% of the votes allocated to the national parliaments, the council presidency will include the item on the agenda of the council for a comprehensive discussion."" Gavin Hewitt: The words ""ever closer union"" stay, but they have been interpreted as not meaning political integration or new powers for the EU. In essence, this is what the government wanted - the EU accepts there are not just different speeds to European integration but countries may have different destinations. What the government did not get was recognition the EU was a union with ""multiple currencies"". Mr Cameron has won inclusion of a ""red-card"" mechanism, a new power. If 55% of national parliaments agree, they could effectively block or veto a commission proposal. The question is how likely is this red card system to be used. A much weaker ""yellow card"" was only used twice. The red-card mechanism depends crucially on building alliances, and the UK has not always been successful at that.In these negotiations, some key areas seem to have been dropped. There will be no repatriation of EU social and employment law, which was a 2010 manifesto commitment. There will be no changes to the working-hours directive. The sceptics will argue that over sovereignty, the UK has not won back control over its affairs.Chris Morris: The idea that different member states will move at different speeds and on ""different paths"" was already widely accepted. Britain won't be in the inner core, but we knew that already. There is also specific language in these draft proposals that encourages the eurozone to integrate further - as most governments accept that it must. The idea of a red card for national parliaments makes a nice headline, but it may not make much difference in practice. It would still be easier to block legislation in the Council of Ministers (threshold 35%) than under the new proposal in which 55% of EU parliaments would have to club together to make an objection. What Cameron wanted: The Conservative manifesto said: ""We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years."" It also proposed a ""new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years"".The manifesto also pledged to ""end the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all"", adding that ""if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leave"".Mr Cameron also wanted to prevent EU migrant workers in the UK sending child benefit or child tax credit money home. ""If an EU migrant's child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid,"" says the Tory manifesto.What Tusk has offered:""[New legislation will] provide for an alert and safeguard mechanism that responds to situations of inflows of workers from other member states of an exceptional magnitude over an extended period of time… the implementing act would authorise the member state to limit the access of union workers newly entering its labour market to in-work benefits for a total of up to four years from the commencement of employment.""Gavin Hewitt: This is the ""emergency brake"" there has been much talk about. If there were excessive strain on the welfare system, in-work benefits could be denied to EU workers for four years. This is, essentially, what Mr Cameron wanted, albeit with access to benefits gradually increasing over time.The government had promised to reduce the numbers of EU migrants and believes the UK's current benefits act as a pull factor. The EU has agreed it would be ""justified"" to trigger an emergency brake without delay after the referendum if the UK votes to stay in the EU. But there are questions here:Mr Cameron has failed in his demand to ban migrant workers from sending child benefit money back home, but they would get a lower level of payments if the cost of living in the country where the child lives is lower.The government has already reached an agreement on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseeker's allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers allowance and housing benefit, for six months. The Tusk letter does not mention changes to social housing entitlement but they were never part of Mr Cameron's preliminary negotiations. Chris Morris: There will still be considerable opposition in Eastern Europe towards anything that smacks of discrimination against their citizens. Little wonder that David Cameron's next stop on his tour of Europe will be a return to Warsaw on Friday. He has some persuading still to do. There is also a lot of detail surrounding the emergency brake proposal that remains vague, and there's likely to be some difficult late night debate ahead. The basic premise - that the UK can treat nationals from other EU countries differently, even if only for a short time - is certainly a departure from the status quo. Other countries may look to take advantage of this as well, and that will make some EU officials nervous.What Cameron wanted: An explicit recognition that the euro is not the only currency of the European Union, to ensure countries outside the eurozone are not materially disadvantaged. He also wanted safeguards that steps to further financial union cannot be imposed on non-eurozone members and the UK will not have to contribute to eurozone bailouts.What Tusk offered: ""Measures, the purpose of which is to further deepen the economic and monetary union, will be voluntary for member states whose currency is not the euro.""Mutual respect between member states participating or not in the operation of the euro area will be ensured.""Legal acts... [between eurozone countries] shall respect the internal market."" Gavin Hewitt: The UK government wanted safeguards that as the eurozone integrated further, it did not take decisions that threatened the essential interests of those outside the eurozone, such as Britain. Key British interests are the single market and the City.Crucially, much of the detail here has not been worked out. It is not clear what rights non-eurozone countries have beyond being consulted and not having to pay for the financial stability of the euro. This could well be a source of friction at the forthcoming summit.Chris Morris: It's just a hunch, but this could still be the issue that has EU leaders haggling into the early hours when they convene for a summit later this month. It threatened to delay the release of Mr Tusk's draft proposals today, as French President Francois Hollande sought assurances that Britain would not hold any kind of veto over eurozone business. Another emergency brake would be deployed here, but it is not entirely clear what would happen if consensus between euro ins and outs proved impossible. This is such an important long-term issue that there may be those who say that further clarity is essential before they can sign up to a final deal. What Cameron wanted: A target for the reduction of the ""burden"" of excessive regulation and extending the single marketWhat Tusk offered: ""The EU must increase efforts towards enhancing competitiveness, along the lines set out in the Declaration of the European Council on competitiveness. To this end the relevant EU institutions and the member states will make all efforts to strengthen the internal market….this means lowering administrative burdens.""Gavin Hewitt: This was the least controversial of the government's demands. The spirit of the times in Brussels is to do less but better. Such statements do not always accord with reality, however. Certainly Mr Cameron has been at the forefront of arguing for less red tape and less regulation on business.Chris Morris: Who doesn't want a more competitive Europe? The question is how best you achieve it.  These proposals envisage a declaration that the EU would work towards greater integration of the single market. But they've said that before, so it doesn't feel all that new. There is also provision for an annual audit of EU regulation with the aim of reducing red tape - but, again, that is already a stated priority of the current European Commission. This feels a little bit like more of the same, but officials argue that it needed clarifying in the context of the EU debate in the UK.

2016-02-03,Canvassing the Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35466853,"Here are ten things about MPs' views about the UK's referendum on whether to stay in or leave the European Union, courtesy of research by the respected political academics Tim Bale, Philip Cowley and Anand Menon.They interviewed 129 MPs, a sample they say is closely representative of Parliament as a whole. So what did those MPs, speaking anonymously, tell them?1) Overwhelmingly, MPs think that the UK will vote to stay in the European Union - that was the response of seven out of 10 of those who spoke to the researchers.But how will MPs themselves vote?2) Half of respondents said they would be voting in favour of remaining in the EU. 11% said they would be voting to leave, but a third said that their views would depend on the terms of the prime minister's renegotiation with Brussels. Among Conservative MPs, 70% either said their vote would be based on the renegotiation, or they didn't know yet how they would vote.So, whilst some say this whole renegotiation malarky is pointless because people will vote on the bigger principle of the UK's place in the world, this research suggests something else: those who are undecided now might be persuadable when a large chunk of MPs (including the prime minister) finally say how they're going to vote, and this could prove decisive. 3) Still not convinced? Take a look at the views of Conservative MPs and Tory party activists. When you compare this study with research into the views of the Tory rank and file, it appears Conservative MPs are slightly more Eurosceptic than their grassroots, but both party members and those at Westminster overwhelmingly say ""lets wait and see what the prime minister gets"". So, on the face of it, the renegotiation does matter to them. Or, perhaps for some, they will want to be loyal to their party leader, and agree with whatever he concludes when the renegotiation is complete. David Cameron is highly likely to advocate staying in the EU - and will probably convince a healthy chunk of Conservative MPs and voters to support him.4) So, given I've claimed there is evidence to suggest this renegotiation does matter, do MPs think David Cameron will achieve very much? The short answer: no. Just 9% of MPs said they expected the negotiations to produce a great deal of change, and 21% expected a ""fair amount"" of change. The majority expected ""not very much"" or no change at all.Therefore, the renegotiation could prove both crucial and, in concrete terms, insubstantial in the view of many.5) How do MPs' views on the EU compare with those of the electorate? By comparing their research with the analysis of others, the academics conclude that Conservative MPs are, on balance, considerably more inclined than voters to believe the UK has not benefited from being a member of the EU. Labour MPs are even more out of line, but in the opposite direction.Tell me more, do I hear you say?6) OK, voters are sceptical about any supposed benefits to the UK of EU members throwing more of their lot in together and integrating, but are nowhere near as sceptical as some Conservative MPs.So, when I say ""European Union,"" what is the first thing that comes into your mind? And what is the first thing that comes into MPs' minds?7) The most referred-to feelings Conservative MPs associate with the EU are ""uneasy"", ""angry"" and ""hopeful."" So not that sunny.8) Labour MPs are positively beaming: ""hopeful"", ""proud"" and ""happy"" are the most popular sentiments from them.9) And what about us lot, the electorate? ""Uneasy"", ""hopeful"" - oh, and ""indifferent"".  Perhaps evidence that the kind of stuff that can obsess Westminster might not mean much to plenty of others. But at least one begs to differ, because....10) ...one MP said they wouldn't be voting in the EU referendum. I wonder who that was?"
2016-02-03,European goals,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35427610,"We know a bit about what politicians and business leaders think about the upcoming referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, but what about the world of football?Would a British exit change the character of the Premier League, which relies so heavily on European players and managers? Or would it give a boost to home-grown talent? As the January transfer window reaches its climax, we asked football experts, the governing bodies and both sides in referendum debate for their views.Football's governing bodies like to stay out of the political spotlight, and they refused to comment when asked if they were for or against the UK's EU membership.But Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore gave an insight into his position last October, in a little reported speech to the Institute of Directors. According to the International Business Times, he said: ""I believe we, in the UK, must be in Europe from a business perspective. I believe in the free movement of goods, but when it comes to services, we must be entitled, especially in the audiovisual world, to territorialism.""By services he meant broadcasting rights, which the Premier League's entire £3.3bn a year business depends on. Scudamore argued that broadcasting rights should be protected by national governments, to protect the Premier League's exports of raw live feeds of games from piracy and copyright infringement.The FA is concerned about the influx of foreign players into the top tier of the English game, which it believes is crowding out young home-grown talent. Working with the Home Office, it has brought in tougher visa restrictions on players from outside the EU, to ensure only established stars can be snapped up by English clubs.The FA declined to comment on whether it would like to see similar restrictions on players from within the EU, which could only come about if Britain left.""The interests of the FA, which is concerned about the future of the England team, and the Premier League, which is concerned with maximising the value of national and international broadcasting rights for the clubs, are far from identical.""If - after Britain left the EU - there was a strict migration quota strictly applied then one would assume that the Home Office would give preference to the thousands of workers needed to keep essential public services going. Footballers and other sports people would not be given priority, except, perhaps, for the absolute stars.""The worst case scenario for the Premier League is that it would not be permitted to attract foreign stars in great numbers and would then lose ground in international sponsorship and broadcasting rights to rivals like Spain and Germany. This would make a minor hole in the UK's invisible exports and tax receipts as well.""While Premier League teams might thus be forced to give more opportunities to home grown English players, it is doubtful whether the growing insularity of English football would actually benefit the England team because of diminished opportunities to play against the very best and to be coached by the very best.""In the end, it will all depend on how British politics evolve after an exit from the EU. If right wing 'Little Englanders' came to power, insisting on the strictest migration quotas, then the international attraction of the Premier League would be significantly reduced.""""British football, its clubs and its fans, are stronger and better off in Europe. ""For clubs, free movement plays a vital role in the transfer marker. Players from the EU can sign for UK clubs without needing a visa or work permit. ""Leaving the EU could have a big impact on foreign players, as a Guardian study has found that around two thirds of Premiership players from the EU would not meet the criteria currently used for non-Europeans to get a work visa automatically. ""Losing this unhindered access to European talent would put British clubs at a disadvantage. FA boss Martin Glenn has said that deteriorating relations between the EU and Britain is one of his 'biggest concerns'.""Fans benefit from Britain's membership of the EU. Europe's single market brings us cheaper flights, making it more affordable to see away games across Europe. Free movement, meanwhile, ensures that British fans don't face visa fees when travelling around Europe. ""But this is not just about the big leagues, it is also about the future of the sport. The EU promotes sport in schools across Europe. Under the Erasmus programme, anyone in Britain with a bright idea for a local football project can get money from the EU to get the ball rolling and make that idea a reality. Britain has received £1.5m in Erasmus sports funding over the past two years. ""Football in our country gains so much from being in Europe. Clubs and fans all benefit from European action, laws and funding. Leaving the EU would hurt our leagues, inconvenience our fans, and be a step back for the next generation of footballers.""""In the dressing room of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, the team tactics are quite clear. Run 'project fear' and scare voters about the prospect of leaving the EU. ""Their latest claims, that football would somehow be damaged by a vote to leave are utter nonsense and should be shown the red card. ""Their claims ignore the fact that outside the EU, we would be free to set our own policy on migration, visas, and work permits to suit our economy and our national game and instead assume we would apply an incredibly restrictive visa regime that literally no-one is arguing for.   ""Right now we are both prevented from implementing policies to nurture domestic talent and from bringing the top footballing talent from right across the globe. That's the worst of all worlds.""The FA has acknowledged the recent restrictions that have been introduced on skilled immigration from non-EU countries are the direct consequence of the EU's freedom of movement rules. ""This has hurt clubs' abilities to bring in players from outside of the EU while preventing any limits from being imposed within the EU. That's not a decision of anyone we elect, that's thanks to the controversial 1995 Bosman ruling in the European Court of Justice. This trade-off has happened across the economy, but what if it didn't have to give up control on players from inside and outside of the EU? ""What if the UK and the FA got to decide who plays in the Premier league from abroad rather than unaccountable and unelected EU judges? That's what would happen if we vote leave. Don't believe the scaremongering to the contrary."" ""Leaving the EU will be of great benefit for British football for it will mean we can lift our horizons to recruit from the rest of the world because it will become easier to introduce footballers from countries outside the EU. ""All we hear is the scaremongering about leaving the EU when the truth is it offers positive opportunities for us and children from poorer nations. Who could be against that?""The freedom of movement for people in the EU comes at the price of heavy restrictions on visas for potential signings from Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia. Once we leave the EU the UK will be free to treat footballers from all countries equally which will broaden the pool of talent for our teams, not reduce it. ""Why should our clubs find it difficult to gain a work permit for a highly talented Moroccan or Nigerian but a Belgian of only average talent is made an easy option. Surely it makes sense to treat everyone equally and let our clubs decide who they want to sign?"" "
2016-02-03,Diplomatic battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20160203173710/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32890895,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron is engaged in intensive diplomacy in Europe to win Britain's partners over to his ambitious plans for EU reform. The UK will hold an in/out referendum on its EU membership by the end of 2017. But what priorities do other EU countries bring to the table? How much overlap with the UK is there? UKMr Cameron's Conservative government sees controlling immigration from the EU as a top priority. Limiting options for EU migrants to claim welfare benefits could make moving to the UK less attractive. Mr Cameron says his main purpose is to eradicate abuse of the system.From 2004 the UK saw a huge surge in migration from Eastern Europe - especially Poland - with EU enlargement.Free movement of people is enshrined as a fundamental right in the EU treaties. It is one of the ""four freedoms"" of the single market - people, goods, services and capital. The European Commission - the EU's executive - says that those freedoms are non-negotiable.Under Mr Cameron's plans, EU migrants new to the UK would not be able to claim in-work benefits, such as tax credits and access to social housing, for four years. The Commission says such a move would be ""highly problematic"", but is considering whether the UK could have an ""emergency brake"" to curb immigration from the EU. The brake might be invoked if the UK could show that migrants were putting too much strain on schools, hospitals and other services.Mr Cameron's other three priorities cover:You can read more about the UK government's EU reform agenda in this Q&A.GermanyEU migrants' welfare claims are certainly a political issue in Germany. The influx of non-EU migrants has put huge pressure on German housing and welfare. A record 1.1 million migrants sought asylum in Germany in 2015.In November 2014 the European Court of Justice backed Germany's right to deny certain benefits to a Romanian woman and her son living in Germany, in the Dano case. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government favours a six-month limit for EU jobseekers, after which they can be expelled from the country, tougher qualification rules for child benefit paid to children living outside Germany and a re-entry ban for welfare fraudsters. That is an agenda similar to Mr Cameron's.But Germany is worried about any UK restrictions on in-work benefits for EU migrants, Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform says.""Germany won't upset the Poles - Germany's relations with Poland are arguably as important as those with the UK,"" he told the BBC.Germany has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe and relies heavily on migrant workers from fellow EU states, many of them Poles.Like the UK Conservatives, the German government is keen to develop the single market. But in the services sector there are some strong vested interests in ""protected"" professions - areas where foreign competitors face high barriers to entry.Germany is one of the strongest advocates of deeper eurozone integration, to bolster the single currency. That has already caused some tensions with the UK.Mrs Merkel wanted a treaty change to enforce new EU-wide budget rules - something that Mr Cameron famously vetoed in December 2011. His veto came after France and Germany had refused to grant a separate ""protocol"" to exempt the City of London from new EU financial service regulations.FranceThere are worries in the French political elite - as in Germany - that Mr Cameron's reform ideas could trigger EU treaty change. That is anathema to President Francois Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, both of whom must fight general elections in 2017.Mr Hollande defends the freedom of movement principle, but there is great concern about immigration in France, particularly after Islamist extremists managed to enter from Belgium undetected last November to murder 130 people in Paris. Mr Hollande's main political rival, conservative ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, is urging reform of the Schengen passport-free travel system. National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen wants barriers to immigration - she totally rejects EU migration policy. So there is some French sympathy for Mr Cameron's demands, though French concerns tend to focus on radicalisation of Muslims in the banlieues (suburbs).French welfare benefits - as in many other EU countries - are mainly insurance-based. The UK's welfare system is more universal - funded out of general taxation. Stephen Booth of the Open Europe think-tank says the UK system makes it harder to change in-work benefits without other Europeans seeing it as discrimination. ""The UK tax credit system doesn't fall neatly into EU definitions of social security,"" he told the BBC.On the single market, France's economic woes have made its politicians more open to liberalisation, and that is happening in some sectors, albeit slowly. Prime Minister Manuel Valls is seen as pro-business and there is French support for creating a capital markets union, so that businesses can turn to financial services other than banks for loans.But France remains hostile to British calls for cuts in agricultural spending.The NetherlandsFree trade lies at the heart of the Dutch commitment to the EU, so in that respect the Dutch position is very close to the UK's.The Dutch government presented EU reform proposals in 2013 which called for less EU regulation, in language similar to Mr Cameron's. They opposed further EU attempts to harmonise social security systems.And the proposals said ""ever closer union"" should not be a general ambition. EU leaders have already started addressing UK concerns on that score. Their summit conclusions in June 2014 said: ""The concept of ever closer union allows for different paths of integration for different countries, allowing those that want to deepen integration to move ahead, while respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further.""The Netherlands supports UK calls to reform the EU's structural funds - big allocations to the EU's poorest regions, which are managed from Brussels. The idea is to end the bureaucratic procedure whereby net contributors to the EU budget send money to Brussels, only for it to be returned in the form of structural funds.Italy Italy is on the frontline of the EU's migration crisis in the Mediterranean and has played a key role in shaping the response to it.Facing unprecedented boatloads of migrants fleeing turmoil in Libya, Italy urged its EU partners to share the burden of housing them and processing asylum claims. That EU burden-sharing is going very slowly - and Greece is now the most urgent challenge. Syrian refugees are the biggest group among thousands of migrants who sail to Greek islands daily from Turkey. The UK has sent naval help to the Mediterranean, but it wants the EU to focus more on smashing people-smuggling networks and stopping the migrants before they reach Libya or Turkey.With its low birth rate Italy faces a big demographic challenge, like Germany, so it does not want measures that could discriminate against EU migrants. Many Italians also work elsewhere in the EU.UK ideas for boosting the single market and competitiveness could however win support in Italy, as its economy is fragile.PolandPolish leaders dislike Mr Cameron's plans on migrant benefits, fearing that they might discriminate against many Polish citizens living in the UK. In recent years more than 800,000 Poles have settled in the UK.However, the new right-wing Polish government is likely to be sympathetic to UK concerns about sovereignty.European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is playing a key role in the UK negotiations.On the euro, both countries worry about a eurozone ""inner club"" developing. Poland is treaty-bound to join the euro in future - unlike the UK. But it is equally concerned to protect its voting rights in economic policy.Poland and other former communist countries want more of the EU budget to be spent in their region, so that they can catch up with the older EU member states. They object to the British budget rebate, which was worth €5.3bn (£3.7bn; $5.8bn) to the UK in 2014.SwedenSweden is often seen as one of the UK's natural allies in Europe, sharing the UK enthusiasm for free trade and the business opportunities in the single market.And like the UK it has stayed out of the euro - though it does not have a treaty opt-out.Immigration has become a thorny issue in Sweden too.Like Mr Cameron, Sweden is keen to lessen the EU's regulatory burden, but it puts more emphasis on protecting workers' rights and promoting the green economy.Mr Cameron can rely on Swedish support for completing the EU single market and reforming the EU budget to help give Europe more economic clout globally.The Swedish parliament is one of the most pro-active in scrutinising EU legislation and in using the ""yellow card"" system, whereby several parliaments acting together can send EU laws back to Brussels for revision. That also brings Sweden closer to the UK Conservatives' agenda."

A draft agreement was published this week and the prime minister is hoping a deal will be backed in two weeks.Proposals to curb EU migrants' benefits are expected to dominate the talks in Warsaw - Poland has said it fears its citizens could face discrimination.The agreement has been dismissed as meaningless by ""Out"" campaigners.The draft proposals were published by European Council president Donald Tusk on Tuesday after months of negotiations between UK and EU officials and pave the way for Britain's EU referendum to take place as early as June.An EU source close to the negotiations told the BBC the proposals had met initial resistance from many countries and Mr Cameron faced two weeks of ""difficult"" negotiations before a summit in Brussels on 18 and 19 February.Among the potential sticking points, the source said, were Mr Cameron's proposals on changing the EU rules to make it easier for member states to band together to block EU laws - and plans to protect non-eurozone countries.Other issues include the proposal for an ""emergency brake"" on in-work benefits.BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said that issue was certain to dominate the talks in Warsaw. But our correspondent said Mr Cameron should expect a supportive welcome in Denmark - a country historically sceptical about the EU and which has opt outs and concerns which are similar to Britain's. In Brussels ambassadors and officials from the 28 member states will meet for the first time since the proposals were published to try to hammer out further compromises. Mr Cameron held talks on Thursday at Downing Street with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, who said afterwards the negotiations were ""not at the end of the process"" but that he was ""optimistic"" of finding a compromise.The PM earlier met Mr Tusk, Slovak PM Robert Fico, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Swedish PM Stefan Lofven and Belgian PM Charles Michel on the margins of the Syria donors' conference in London.Countries on the EU's eastern flank, meanwhile, are to meet next week before providing a joint response to the reform package, Hungary's foreign minister said.Mr Cameron is also under pressure at home from some members of his own cabinet, who have been prevented from speaking out in favour of a British EU exit.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale refused to rule out campaigning to leave the EU, in an interview with The House magazine, saying he would look at the agreement the prime minister managed to secure.Referendum timeline: What will happen when?Guide: All you need to know about the referendumThe view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"

2016-02-04,May feared creation of PCC 'monster',https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35497533,"Home Secretary Theresa May has admitted fearing she had created a ""monster"" by setting up police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.She said a number of incidents had given PCCs a ""bad name"", including criticism by Surrey's Kevin Hurley of his former chief constable Lynne Owens.But she also revealed she was planning to extend the powers of PCCs after their elections in May.This could include them setting up free schools for ""troubled children"".PCCs, who replaced the previous model of police authorities, have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.They were first elected in November 2012 on a historically low turnout, and the next set of elections takes place in May.At a Policy Exchange event in London, Mrs May acknowledged some of the problems involving PCCs had made her wonder if she had done the right thing by establishing the system as a replacement for police authorities.She said: ""In 2012, you could be forgiven for thinking that we were creating a monster. And I'd be lying if I said there weren't times over the last three and a half years when I thought we might have done just that.""She highlighted incidents including the former South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright's initial refusal to resign following damning revelations of child sexual abuse in Rotherham; the appointment of a youth commissioner in Kent with no background checks, only for her to have to stand down after it was revealed she had posted offensive tweets as a teenager; and the dispute involving Mr Hurley.The BBC recently learned Mr Hurley had strongly criticised his chief constable Lynne Owens before her appointment as the new National Crime Agency head.""These episodes have been disappointing and there's no doubt that some of them have brought the office of the PCC into disrepute,"" said Mrs May.Labour has said it would abolish PCCs and put the savings into front-line policing.But Mrs May proposed an expansion of their role. She said the government had not yet decided the ""full extent"" of its proposed changes but said there were ""significant"" opportunities for reform.""The next set of PCCs should bring together the two great reforms of the last Parliament - police reform and school reform - to work with and possibly set up alternative-provision free schools to support troubled children and prevent them from falling into a life of crime,"" she said. The home secretary suggested mergers between PCCs and directly elected mayors, saying there was a ""fantastic opportunity"" for policing and other services to be brought together ""under a single directly elected mayor"".PCCs could also have a role in youth justice, probation and court services, she said.This suggestion was welcomed by the Institute for Public Policy Research, which said it ""makes sense"" to give locally elected leaders control over the services.The think tank's Jonathan Clifton said: ""This will enable them to join up with other local services and tackle the things that lead to offending - such as lack of qualifications, mental health problems and homelessness."""
2016-02-04,$10bn pledged for conflict-hit Syrians,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35497299,"Donor nations meeting in London have pledged more than $10bn to help Syrians affected by the five-year conflict, UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced.He said the money (£6.8bn) would provide millions in Syria with ""life-saving"" food, medical care and shelter.More jobs and schooling would be provided for refugees in neighbouring countries, he said.In Syria, tens of thousands of people are reported to be fleeing intense fighting near Aleppo.Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said an estimated 70,000 Syrians were heading towards its borders amid a Syrian government offensive, backed by Russian air strikes.In war-ravaged Damascus suburbsWho is to blame for breakdown of talks?The offensive prompted the suspension of fledgling UN-brokered peace talks in Geneva.While the conference has been a financial success, the prospects for ending the war in Syria look bleaker than ever, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says.Mr Cameron said at the end of the day-long conference that $6bn had been pledged for 2016 alone, and a further $5bn over the coming years until 2020.He said Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon - which are housing most of the 4.6 million refugees - had also pledged to ensure all refugee children will have access to education.""The international union is backing them with the resources which will allow them to ensure there is no lost generation,"" he said, adding that one million children currently not in school would have access to education by the end of the next school year.The neighbouring countries had also, he said, made a ""courageous commitment"" to open their economies to provide more jobs - helped by $40bn of loans and the opening of European markets that would create one million new jobs in the region.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hailed the gathering of 60 countries as a ""great success"".""Never has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis,"" he said.The European Union has pledged $3.3bn (€3bn; £2.3bn) this year and intends to ""maintain this level of financing"" for 2017 and beyond. The UK pledged an extra $1.7bn until 2020, Germany committed to $2.6bn until 2018, France said it would give $1bn and the US pledged an extra $925m for 2016.Australia, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Japan, the UAE, Austria, Switzerland, Estonia, Denmark and Finland, along with the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, were among those who also committed funds.The conference, attended by 30 world leaders, had been hoping to raise $9bn - a total made up of a UN appeal for $7.7bn and about $1.3bn requested by regional host governments.Part of the reason for the record request is the underfunding of previous appeals. Only 43% of the $2.9bn pledged to the UN's 2015 appeal has so far been funded.Hours before the conference began, peace talks between the Syrian regime and opposition were suspended, amid rebel anger over the continuing Russian bombing around Aleppo.The talks, which opened just two days ago, are expected to resume on 25 February. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura admitted there had been a lack of progress but said that the negotiations had not failed.Ban Ki-moon, speaking in London, said that the Syrian people needed ""not just food for today, but hope for tomorrow"" and urged both sides to ""get back to the table, not to secure more gains on the battlefield.""A number of countries criticised Russia for conducting air strikes to help the Syrian army advance. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC the strikes had ""increased in intensity dramatically over the last few days... we've got to press the Russians to do something that will actually support this political process, not torpedo it"".Why is there a war in Syria?Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, the so-called Islamic State group, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.Who is fighting whom?Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. How has the world reacted?Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes."

He was on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee and was a parliamentary aide to shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy. Mr Harpham was elected after former home secretary David Blunkett announced his intention to stand down at the 2015 election. He won the seat with a majority of 13,807.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Mr Harpham, describing him as ""a proud socialist"" who was ""dedicated to justice for working people"".  In a statement, Mr Corbyn added: ""Despite the undoubted hardship that his support for the miners' strike would have caused him, as it did many thousands of miners, Harry recently told me he would have done it all again. ""To the very end he was fighting for working people in parliament.  What a decent man he was and he will be sadly missed by all his friends in the Labour Party.""Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson tweeted: ""Deeply upset to learn of Harry Harpham's death. Sheffield has lost a wonderful MP. My thoughts are with his family.""Mr Harpham's final contribution in the House of Commons came on 20 January at Prime Minister's Questions.Addressing the issue of job losses at Sheffield Forgemasters, he accused the government of ""warm words, hand-wringing and some crocodile tears"" over a ""tsunami of losses in the steel industry"". Mr Harpham leaves behind his wife Gill and children Annie, Kieron, Dan, Emily and Victoria."

It's clear the negotiations are going to be difficult.""Among the potential sticking points were Mr Cameron's proposals on changing the EU rules to make it easier for member states to band together to block EU laws - and plans to protect non-eurozone countries.These two demands will need work to be incorporated into future EU treaties.The EU source said some member states had indicated to European Council President Donald Tusk that they found that ""unacceptable"". Other issues include Mr Cameron's ""emergency brake"" on in-work benefits and his desire to exempt to the UK from a commitment to ""ever closer union"". The prime minister is aiming to get a final deal on his reform package, hammered out with Mr Tusk, at a summit on 18-19 February.Such objections are not unusual at this stage of difficult EU negotiations.Mr Cameron is also under pressure at home from some members of his own cabinet, who have been prevented from speaking out in favour of a British EU exit.A cabinet source has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the prime minister has promised to stop speaking publicly about the benefits of his EU deal until the renegotiations are complete.""There is agreement that the rules should be the same for both sides, and that no member of the cabinet should speak out until the PM has returned from Brussels with his deal.""Downing St have given a renewed guarantee that everyone will be held to those rules equally,"" the source said.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale refused to rule out campaigning to leave the EU, in an interview with The House magazine, saying he would look at the agreement the prime minister managed to secure.Mr Cameron held talks on Thursday at Downing Street with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, who said afterwards the negotiations were ""not at the end of the process"" but that he was ""optimistic"" of finding a compromise.The PM earlier had met Mr Tusk, Slovak PM Robert Fico, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Swedish PM Stefan Lofven and Belgian PM Charles Michel in the margins of the Syria donors' conference in London.Countries on the EU's eastern flank, meanwhile, are to meet next week before providing a joint response to the reform package, Hungary's foreign minister said.Peter Szijjarto told Reuters that if Britain was allowed to restrict EU nationals' benefits it would raise ""serious questions"" about other large member states replicating the move.Mr Cameron says the proposals will make Britain's position ""stronger and better"" and that an ""emergency brake"" on welfare will reduce migration from the EU.But some of his backbenchers say he has missed the point and should be focusing instead on the issue of sovereignty, which they say lies at the heart of the UK's relationship with EU.In a Commons debate, Tory MP John Baron mocked the ""red card"" which would allow measures from Brussels to be blocked, but only if 55% of EU national parliaments agreed. He told MPs: ""The so-called red card system is nothing more than a washed-out lottery ticket. ""It would be like a football referee getting out his 'fraction' of a red card, only then having to consult with 14 other officials before deciding what to do - by which time the game is over."""

If we get to 50.001% it is a win.""I want to win, but we will win by a substantial margin.""He added later: ""I think if we just keep going, beating the drum and saying what the facts are then common sense will prevail.""Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, which is competing with Leave.EU to be the official campaign to quit the EU, said: ""The cosy establishment club doesn't want change because it does well out of the status quo.""But the people want change and to take back control. It's a David v Goliath struggle - but we all know who ended up winning that one.""Meanwhile, a row erupted between the two groups vying for official designation from the Electoral Commission - which brings access to public funds, TV broadcasts and a £7m spending limit.Tory MP Steve Baker, whose Conservatives for Britain group is affiliated to Vote Leave, rejected the idea of a merger, saying differences remained on tactics.Arron Banks, the UKIP donor behind Leave.EU, accused Vote Leave of ""jeopardising this historic referendum"" with their ""unwillingness"" to work with other groups."

He wants to avoid extradition to Sweden over a rape claim, which he denies.The Met Police says Mr Assange will be arrested if he leaves the embassy.Swedish prosecutors said the UN panel's decision would have ""no formal impact"" on its ongoing investigation. Mr Assange earlier said his passport should be returned and his arrest warrant dropped if the UN panel, due to deliver its findings on Friday, ruled in his favour.The Australian was originally arrested in London in 2010 under a European Arrest Warrant issued by Sweden over rape and sexual assault claims. In 2012, while on bail, he claimed asylum inside the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge after the UK Supreme Court had ruled the extradition against him could go ahead.Swedish prosecutors dropped two sex assault claims against Mr Assange last year. However, he still faces the more serious accusation of rape.Why is Julian Assange back in the news?Who is Julian Assange?Timeline of the Julian Assange caseHow unhealthy is living indoors?In 2014, Mr Assange complained to the UN that he was being ""arbitrarily detained"" as he could not leave the embassy without being arrested.The application claimed Mr Assange had been ""deprived of his liberty in an arbitrary manner for an unacceptable length of time"".The UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has been investigating the issue.The Press Association said key factors in the panel's decision would include the inability of Mr Assange to access political asylum, the fact he has never been charged, and changes to UK law and procedures since he arrived at the embassy. Wikileaks earlier tweeted it was waiting for ""official confirmation"" of the UN panel's decision.Downing Street said the panel's ruling would not be legally binding in the UK while a European Arrest Warrant remained in place.""We have been consistently clear that Mr Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK but is, in fact, voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorean embassy,"" a spokesman said.""The UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.""The Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement that it noted the UN panel's decision ""differs from that of the Swedish authorities"".The statement added the legal process for Mr Assange's case would be handled in court by Swedish prosecutors.  Per Samuelsson, Mr Assange's lawyer, said Swedish authorities would be ""morally"" wrong to continue the investigation if the UN panel found in his favour.""The ball is in Sweden's yard, in the prosecutor's yard. She is not formally bound by the decision by the UN, but morally it is very difficult to go against it.""The journalist John Pilger, who is a friend of Mr Assange, said ""the ball is now at the feet of the British government"", whose international legal ""obligations"" were represented by the UN panel. ""They did something in terms of supporting the tribunal in all the other celebrated cases, and Assange now joins them because the UN jurists have clearly found this is a case of arbitrary detention,"" he said. Mr Assange's Wikileaks organisation posted secret American government documents on the internet, and he says Washington could seek his extradition to the US to face espionage charges if he is sent to Sweden.In the statement, published earlier by Wikileaks on Twitter, Mr Assange said: ""Should the UN announce tomorrow that I have lost my case against the United Kingdom and Sweden I shall exit the embassy at noon on Friday to accept arrest by British police as there is no meaningful prospect of further appeal.""However, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me.""Last October, Scotland Yard said it would no longer station officers outside the Ecuador embassy following an operation which it said had cost £12.6m. But it said ""a number of overt and covert tactics to arrest him"" would still be deployed."

According to its research, people in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Somerset, Dorset, West Berkshire, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire, North Yorkshire and Lancashire will be among the worst affected.Oxfordshire County Council says it is looking to save nearly £4m by cutting subsidies to more than 100 routes. It told the BBC it had been left with no choice but to include buses in the services it was cutting, because of an overall reduction in government funding to councils.Martin Abrams, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""Up and down the country utterly devastating cuts are now being inflicted on our vital bus services on a par with the swingeing and misguided cuts the government and Dr Beeching made to our rail network which decimated services back in the 1960s.""Buses are overseen by the Department for Transport in England and the Welsh Assembly in Wales, but decisions on funding for services are made by local authorities.Transport minister Andrew Jones said: ""The government protected around £250m of funding for bus services in England, provided through the Bus Service Operators Grant, as part of last year's spending review.""He said ministers had also provided £7.6m in support for 37 local transport schemes in rural areas, while more than 300 charities and community groups across England would benefit from new minibuses through a £25m fund.He added: ""We are also developing measures in the upcoming Buses Bill so local authorities can deliver improved bus services.""The Welsh government, meanwhile, said last month it was committed to improving the quality and accessibility of local bus services.Labour's shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner said: ""David Cameron promised to keep the free bus pass but he cut the buses instead. Labour would make sure that local communities have the power to make bus operators provide the services local people need.""Peter Box, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, called for the concessionary fares under which councils provide free off-peak travel for elderly and disabled residents to be fully funded by the government.He added: ""Councils know how important buses are for their communities and local economies and are desperate to protect them. Instead, many across the country are reluctantly taking difficult decisions to scale back services and review subsidised routes as a result."""

""I am confident that other senior figures will step forward to support the Vote Leave campaign, but I am happy to help the board and campaign team make the appropriate decisions in the crucial weeks ahead,"" said Lord Lawson.He replaces Labour donor and home shopping magnate John Mills as Vote Leave's chairman. Mr Mills will become deputy chairman, focusing on the work of the Labour Leave group in targeting centre-left voters. Vote Leave is competing with Leave.EU to be officially designated as the Out campaign for the UK's in-out referendum.Leave.EU said the departures of Mr Cummings and Mr Elliott from the board means ""major obstacles"" to a merger between the groups have been removed.But speaking on BBC Newsnight, Tory MP Steve Baker, whose Conservatives for Britain group is affiliated to Vote Leave, said he did not think this was possible, because of a ""genuine disagreement about strategy and tactics"".""I believe Vote Leave will win the designation, I believe Vote Leave will win the referendum,"" he added.Britain Stronger In Europe seized on the shake-up in Vote Leave's management structure to claim the campaign had ""descended into all-out farce"" and that the ""demotion"" of John Mills was ""the final nail in the coffin for their claims to represent a truly cross-party coalition"".

2016-02-04,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-04,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-04,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-04,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-04,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-04,Albion Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35470281,"Britain could take the road that leads out of Europe - or, to be more precise, the EU - in just 139 days' time. If that is to happen, who will drive the decision? The answer highlights some significant divisions in British society.Prof John Curtice, pretty much the only poll watcher to emerge from the last election with his reputation enhanced, says that ""those who want to leave the European Union are demographically very distinctive - most distinctive of all are those who have relatively little in the way of educational qualifications"". The figures from the most recent British Social Attitudes survey in 2014 are stark. Just 35% of those who have no qualifications want to remain in the EU compared with 78% of those with university degrees. If you travel to Albion Street in the market town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, it's pretty clear why. To many of the people who work here, the EU looks like a club that doesn't much want them as members. It appears to be run by wealthy, well-educated men in suits for wealthy, well-educated men in suits. Julie McLeod, 46, who works at Brown & Wenman opticians, is typical of the sort of voter who could take us out of the EU. ""I'm a bit sceptical really of the whole Europe thing. I think they control too much of our laws,"" she told me. ""You want a situation where the British government can decide what the British government wants to do. We need a bit more say.""Julie, like many women voters, has not yet decided for certain how she'll vote. If Leave is to win, they need to convince many more people like her that the benefits of quitting outweigh the risks. Like so many others, immigration - and our government's inability to control it - is what bothers her most. Next door on Albion Street, shopkeeper Tim Smart spells out how he believes the recent influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has affected him, his family and his town. He complains that those who come here have an unfair advantage as not only do they speak their own languages but they go to English schools and learn to speak English as well. ""If they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position anywhere, who would you employ? Someone who speaks two languages or someone who speaks one language? My daughter has just had it in Northampton, funnily enough. It doesn't feel like a level playing field in my eyes.""Tim speaks for those who believe that immigration control is not simply a question of the country being too full, or of race or religion, but is a question of fairness.It is people like him who David Cameron has in mind when he talks of ending ""something for nothing"" by limiting the in-work benefits EU migrants can get. It was a proposal that emerged from intensive polling and countless focus groups, although so far he's had to water the idea down.Another sign that you may well be in favour of leaving the EU is your age. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to get out. It's an irony that the one group that have already had a vote on Europe - anyone aged 58 or older who could have voted when the last referendum was held in 1975 - are precisely the people who now want another chance to reverse the decision taken back then.The British Social Attitudes survey shows that almost half - 46% - of those over 55 want to get out while half that number - 23% - of those under 35 agree with them.Speaking to Kenneth Spinks, who's 85, you get a sense of why. He feels that he was invited to vote to join an economic club in which it was easier and cheaper to buy and sell things - the Common Market as it was known then - and has instead found himself governed by a big, bossy, bureaucratic organisation in Brussels.I spoke to him in the local Conservative Club. One more sign that you might be a Leaver is that you voted Conservative at the last election. Tory voters are much less likely to be pro-EU than those of other parties - other than UKIP, of course. That is why the draft deal David Cameron unveiled this week matters so much. Many Conservative voters - the people who backed the prime minister just last May - will be inclined to follow his lead just as Labour voters followed Harold Wilson's back in 1975. Kenneth couldn't have been clearer that he wants to quit Europe until we had this exchange.Me: ""You're a staunch Tory man, but even if the Tory leader says, 'I want us to stay in, I think it's in the best interest of the country,' you'd vote against him, would you?Kenneth: ""Well, it's all according to what he'll come back with. If he'll come back with something that's really good, it might sway me a bit.""Take a few more paces along Albion Street and you'll find the last crucial group of potential ""leavers"" - small businesspeople who, unlike those who run big companies, don't export to Europe but do still have to put up with its rules.Aaron Lee, 28, who runs Lee & Sons Cleaning Services, says:  ""All we're doing is paying out fortunes of money to join this trading union, and being told what we can and can't do. ""For example, we can only use a certain power Hoover because they've governed the power rating down. Where we could Hoover a floor in an hour, it's now going to take us two.""The Leave campaign cannot win simply by building a coalition of old, non graduate, self-employed voters. They will need - and, indeed, already have - support from younger, well-educated people who work for big businesses too. However, it is these divisions in society that could determine the future of our country for decades to come.The Today programme will be running a separate piece later on which voters are most likely to vote for the UK to remain in the EU."
2016-02-04,Will EU deal deliver?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35486520,"Cutting immigration, curbing benefits and returning powers from Brussels are among the key aims of David Cameron's EU reform deal, but will any of it work in practice?David Cameron fought hard to get a four year ban on new arrivals from other EU nations claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, which top up low wages.It will not be a blanket ban, as he had wanted, but will be graduated, so the longer migrants work in the UK, the more benefits they will become entitled to. The prime minister insists this will ""make a difference"" to high levels of immigration by reducing one of the main ""pull factors"" attracting people to the UK.But there is little direct evidence to suggest it will work.Sir Stephen Nickell, a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year he believed it was ""unlikely to have a huge impact"".The main ""pull factor"" for migrants is the availability of jobs, according to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, and campaign group Migration Watch.Benefits might prove to be an attraction to some, but most EU-born migrant workers are single or childless couples who do not claim a lot of tax credits, researchers say.Migration Watch said Mr Cameron's ""emergency brake"" on benefits would be ""unlikely to have any significant effect on levels of migration"".Some campaigners have suggested that increasing the amount of benefits people can receive each year will encourage them to remain in Britain.The in-work benefit ban was dreamed up by influential think tank Open Europe (its former boss Mats Persson is now Mr Cameron's chief adviser on EU reform).It argued in a November 2014 paper, that banning in-work benefits would mean take-home pay could drop below that which migrants would receive in their home states - they used Poland, Bulgaria and Spain as their examples - meaning that a move to the UK would no longer make financial sense.But the UK's plan to increase its minimum wage to £9 an hour for over-25s by 2020, which the government claims will remove the need to top-up wages with benefits, could undermine that argument.Also, it is not clear how checks would be made on how long people have actually been in the UK. Some regularly travel in and out of the UK or return to their home country to see family for a few months at a time.Asked whether Mr Cameron believed the proposed 'emergency brake' will cut immigration, a Downing Street spokesman said that migrant families were currently able to claim an average of £6,000 a year in tax credits and some 10,000 were claiming £10,000 or more.The UK spends about £30m a year on child benefit payments for children that do not live in the UK. About 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin.A majority of those payments go to children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.David Cameron wanted to change EU rules to end this, but instead he has been offered a deal under which child benefit will be paid in line with the wages in the country where the child is living.UK child benefit is £20.40 a week for the first child, about 5% of the average income. Under the proposed new rules, that might be reduced to £3.50 for a child living in Romania, where wages are low.But it might also mean the UK will pay higher levels of child benefit for than it currently does for children living in countries with higher average wages.There are also concerns that the Department for Work and Pensions will struggle to cope with calculating 28 different rates of child benefit, for each member state.Officials have also told the BBC they are unsure how they can be certain where the children of migrants are resident. David Cameron secured a clear legal statement that the UK was not committed to further political integration and that the phrase ""ever closer union"" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties. He also got new powers for national parliaments to band together to block unwanted EU laws - but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used. The ""red card"" procedure can only be triggered if at least 15 national Parliaments, representing 55% of the EU's population, agree.London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would be better if the UK was able to block EU laws on its own without having to rely on the support of other EU nations.In response to Mr Johnson's concerns, Mr Cameron revealed on Wednesday that he is planning to announced a measure that will put the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament ""beyond doubt"".Eurosceptic Tory MPs are pushing for a repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to assert that UK law has primacy over EU law. But critics say this would be tantamount to leaving the EU.Instead, the government is looking at ways of asserting parliamentary sovereignty that would question and challenge EU decisions but without causing constitutional chaos.There is speculation Mr Cameron will make some kind of unilateral declaration of sovereignty, at the same time as he concludes his negotiations over Britain's reformed relationship with the EU.And that he will use this to persuade Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU since this is an issue on which the mayor has campaigned for many months.Downing Street is refusing to give details of the proposals which are being worked on by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice. But Mr Cameron gave a hint last year in his November 10 Chatham House speech when he said ministers were looking at the way Germany used its constitutional court to test EU law.He said then: ""The Constitutional Court in Germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to Europe. And it also reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers, or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."""

The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk reaches for his Shakespeare to stress the enormity of the decision before us. He doesn't spell out that Hamlet is pondering a big existential question - whether or not to kill himself, and so risk an eternity in hell. He may well think that leaving the EU is the global equivalent of being cut off from God's love in a fiery pit for all time. But the quote is not propitious. Hamlet of course, does not kill himself. But he and almost everyone else ends up dead, sprawled across the stage. I am sure it is an unintended irony that the only person left alive to survey the tragedy is young Fortinbras from Norway, a country that these days is outside the EU.There will enough words, wild and whirling, from me and others on the deal and the UK position. For now I want to look at the big picture of what the deal says about the state of the European Union itself and where it is heading. In tabloid speak ""How EU feeling?""After all the EU is in precarious crisis, its purpose and even existence in question, even without the threat of an important member leaving the club.The flood of migration has highlighted the EU's inability to reach swift decisions and its inability to implement them.  Like Hamlet it reflects, and dithers and debates rather than acts. But it makes the hesitant Prince of Denmark look like a ninja assassin. It has rendered the precious passport area ""more honoured in the breach than the observance"" to coin a phrase. It has narrowly avoided seeing a country chucked out of the Euro, leaving fundamental dangers and flaws behind the Greek crisis unsolved.  The Ukraine crisis raises huge questions about the EU's geographical limits and identity.  The need to have Turkey onside underscores them.In nearly every country we see the continued growth of parties which stress national self-interest over some common European destiny, and doubt the worth of the EU.For the first time in my life it is not hard to imagine the European Union slowly falling apart.Cheer or weep, that's huge, because no one knows what would follow.Read more:The danger for Mr Cameron is that while back at home some will claim he has won only a handful of worthless glass beads, other presidents and prime ministers may feel they have showered him with precious jewels.The deal may not be a pivotal point in the argument about the UK's membership but it is an interesting recognition of reality by the European Union itself, a bucket of cold water thrown over some of its aspirations. The French and Dutch ""no"" vote to the European constitution in 2005 were the high water mark of European federalism. These documents don't confirm that the political romantic dream of a super-national state is dead. They do suggest that it is lying down in a darkened room, not quite feeling itself.One important paragraph suggests that ""ever closer union"" is about a warm friendly feeling, not ""political integration"". Another acknowledges the Euro is not the only currency in operation, and two states need not join, and that their interests count too.The ""red card"" is vacuous, but a symbolic recognition that national Parliaments matter. There is a breach in the idea of equal treatment of workers, while arguing there isn't.There has been a lot of tosh talked over the years about a two-speed or two-tier Europe. In fact for ages the reality has been a multi-speed Europe, different countries joining in different parts of the project. There is a rather nice, pointed, passage in these documents where all the UK's opt-outs and exceptions are listed. There are six such protocols. If the EU has multiple orbits, Britain is Neptune, on the outer reaches of the solar system.This deal accepts that is fine.  It does not treat the UK's opt-outs as a perversion to be overcome by long and patient therapy, but a fact. It accepts the UK will continue to be a friend with benefits, and a white wedding isn't going to happen.  It doesn't encourage others to adopt the same position but it leaves the possibility open. If the UK leaves it will be an earth-shattering moment for the EU. The huge fundamental questions about its purpose will be asked afresh, with great angst. It will be diminished on the world stage, and be full of the forlorn questioning of the self-worth of the spurned lover. But if the UK stays, Mr Tusk's fundamental question remains. What is it the EU wants to be, if it is to be?At its heart is a paradox. Intellectually and rationally those who argue that the answer is more Europe have a point. More central authority, with a stronger common police and border force, and the ability to overrule individual countries would be one way out of the crisis. It just wouldn't be very palatable or democratic. Most economists, and indeed the British Government, acknowledge the Euro countries need deeper fiscal and economic integration. The trouble isn't merely that this goes right against the mood of the voters for less Europe. It goes against the mood of many national governments too - fed up being bossed, not by Brussels, but Berlin.It is very hard to see past this conundrum - Hamlet didn't only dither because of a fundamental flaw - but because all the available answers were the bad ones."
2016-02-04,Campaigner Cameron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35476204,"It comprises 17 pages of closely argued legal jargon, diplomatic ambiguity and square brackets. The contents are dismissed by critics as a ""pint-sized package"" that fails to match the prime minister's lofty ambition of fundamental reform. It is a draft text that oozes with the obfuscation of old-style EU fudge. There are paragraphs of compromise that fail to meet the promises of the Conservative manifesto. The newspapers look down sniffily and ask: ""Is that it?"" Tory MPs mutter to one another in the corridors of Westminster, unable to hide their disappointment. One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of ""polishing a poo"". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders. And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain ""better off, more secure, more prosperous"". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the ""best of worlds"" and that was ""something worth fighting for"".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed. But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive. And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat. So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today. And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling. They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month. But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave. It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak. So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal. But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating. In other words, the referendum campaign has begun. "
2016-02-04,EU leaders on board?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35469933,"My first instinct is that this is something everyone can work with.Eastern and Central European countries will continue to complain about the suspension of migrant in-work benefits.They are likely to argue that the EU has sold its principles down the river in an attempt to keep the UK in the EU. They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels. However the government will hope it will sound good in terms of wrestling back powers from Brussels to the UK - and to other EU countries.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumReferendum timeline: What will happen when?Q&A: What does Britain want from Europe?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-04,Analysing Tusk letter,https://web.archive.org//web/20160205045542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471117,"David Cameron has hailed a draft EU reform deal as delivering the ""substantial changes"" he wants to see to the UK's relationship with the 28-nation bloc.He says some work is needed to hammer out the details ahead of a crunch summit in Brussels on 18 February.But how does the 16-page letter drawn up by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, measure up to what the prime minister originally wanted from the negotiations?The BBC's chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt gives his verdict while Europe correspondent Chris Morris looks at how the deal will be perceived elsewhere in the EU.What Cameron wanted: Allowing Britain to opt out from the EU's founding ambition to forge an ""ever closer union"" of the peoples of Europe so it will not be drawn into further political integration in a ""formal, legally binding and irreversible way"". Giving greater powers to national parliaments to block EU legislation.What Tusk has offered: ""The references to an ever closer union among the peoples are... compatible with different paths of integration being available for different member states and do not compel all member states to aim for a common destination.""It is recognised that the United Kingdom... is not committed to further political integration into the European Union.""Where reasoned opinions on the non-compliance of a draft union legislative act with the principle of subsidiarity, sent within 12 weeks from the transmission of that draft, represent more than 55% of the votes allocated to the national parliaments, the council presidency will include the item on the agenda of the council for a comprehensive discussion."" Gavin Hewitt: The words ""ever closer union"" stay, but they have been interpreted as not meaning political integration or new powers for the EU. In essence, this is what the government wanted - the EU accepts there are not just different speeds to European integration but countries may have different destinations. What the government did not get was recognition the EU was a union with ""multiple currencies"". Mr Cameron has won inclusion of a ""red-card"" mechanism, a new power. If 55% of national parliaments agree, they could effectively block or veto a commission proposal. The question is how likely is this red card system to be used. A much weaker ""yellow card"" was only used twice. The red-card mechanism depends crucially on building alliances, and the UK has not always been successful at that.In these negotiations, some key areas seem to have been dropped. There will be no repatriation of EU social and employment law, which was a 2010 manifesto commitment. There will be no changes to the working-hours directive. The sceptics will argue that over sovereignty, the UK has not won back control over its affairs.Chris Morris: The idea that different member states will move at different speeds and on ""different paths"" was already widely accepted. Britain won't be in the inner core, but we knew that already. There is also specific language in these draft proposals that encourages the eurozone to integrate further - as most governments accept that it must. The idea of a red card for national parliaments makes a nice headline, but it may not make much difference in practice. It would still be easier to block legislation in the Council of Ministers (threshold 35%) than under the new proposal in which 55% of EU parliaments would have to club together to make an objection. What Cameron wanted: The Conservative manifesto said: ""We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years."" It also proposed a ""new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years"".The manifesto also pledged to ""end the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all"", adding that ""if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leave"".Mr Cameron also wanted to prevent EU migrant workers in the UK sending child benefit or child tax credit money home. ""If an EU migrant's child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid,"" says the Tory manifesto.What Tusk has offered:""[New legislation will] provide for an alert and safeguard mechanism that responds to situations of inflows of workers from other member states of an exceptional magnitude over an extended period of time… the implementing act would authorise the member state to limit the access of union workers newly entering its labour market to in-work benefits for a total of up to four years from the commencement of employment.""Gavin Hewitt: This is the ""emergency brake"" there has been much talk about. If there were excessive strain on the welfare system, in-work benefits could be denied to EU workers for four years. This is, essentially, what Mr Cameron wanted, albeit with access to benefits gradually increasing over time.The government had promised to reduce the numbers of EU migrants and believes the UK's current benefits act as a pull factor. The EU has agreed it would be ""justified"" to trigger an emergency brake without delay after the referendum if the UK votes to stay in the EU. But there are questions here:Mr Cameron has failed in his demand to ban migrant workers from sending child benefit money back home, but they would get a lower level of payments if the cost of living in the country where the child lives is lower.The government has already reached an agreement on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseeker's allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers allowance and housing benefit, for six months. The Tusk letter does not mention changes to social housing entitlement but they were never part of Mr Cameron's preliminary negotiations. Chris Morris: There will still be considerable opposition in Eastern Europe towards anything that smacks of discrimination against their citizens. Little wonder that David Cameron's next stop on his tour of Europe will be a return to Warsaw on Friday. He has some persuading still to do. There is also a lot of detail surrounding the emergency brake proposal that remains vague, and there's likely to be some difficult late night debate ahead. The basic premise - that the UK can treat nationals from other EU countries differently, even if only for a short time - is certainly a departure from the status quo. Other countries may look to take advantage of this as well, and that will make some EU officials nervous.What Cameron wanted: An explicit recognition that the euro is not the only currency of the European Union, to ensure countries outside the eurozone are not materially disadvantaged. He also wanted safeguards that steps to further financial union cannot be imposed on non-eurozone members and the UK will not have to contribute to eurozone bailouts.What Tusk offered: ""Measures, the purpose of which is to further deepen the economic and monetary union, will be voluntary for member states whose currency is not the euro.""Mutual respect between member states participating or not in the operation of the euro area will be ensured.""Legal acts... [between eurozone countries] shall respect the internal market."" Gavin Hewitt: The UK government wanted safeguards that as the eurozone integrated further, it did not take decisions that threatened the essential interests of those outside the eurozone, such as Britain. Key British interests are the single market and the City.Crucially, much of the detail here has not been worked out. It is not clear what rights non-eurozone countries have beyond being consulted and not having to pay for the financial stability of the euro. This could well be a source of friction at the forthcoming summit.Chris Morris: It's just a hunch, but this could still be the issue that has EU leaders haggling into the early hours when they convene for a summit later this month. It threatened to delay the release of Mr Tusk's draft proposals today, as French President Francois Hollande sought assurances that Britain would not hold any kind of veto over eurozone business. Another emergency brake would be deployed here, but it is not entirely clear what would happen if consensus between euro ins and outs proved impossible. This is such an important long-term issue that there may be those who say that further clarity is essential before they can sign up to a final deal. What Cameron wanted: A target for the reduction of the ""burden"" of excessive regulation and extending the single marketWhat Tusk offered: ""The EU must increase efforts towards enhancing competitiveness, along the lines set out in the Declaration of the European Council on competitiveness. To this end the relevant EU institutions and the member states will make all efforts to strengthen the internal market….this means lowering administrative burdens.""Gavin Hewitt: This was the least controversial of the government's demands. The spirit of the times in Brussels is to do less but better. Such statements do not always accord with reality, however. Certainly Mr Cameron has been at the forefront of arguing for less red tape and less regulation on business.Chris Morris: Who doesn't want a more competitive Europe? The question is how best you achieve it.  These proposals envisage a declaration that the EU would work towards greater integration of the single market. But they've said that before, so it doesn't feel all that new. There is also provision for an annual audit of EU regulation with the aim of reducing red tape - but, again, that is already a stated priority of the current European Commission. This feels a little bit like more of the same, but officials argue that it needed clarifying in the context of the EU debate in the UK.

2016-02-05,Charities' government grant use curbed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35509117,"Organisations given UK government grants will be banned from using the money to try to persuade ministers to change the law or increase spending.A new clause will be added into all new and renewed grant agreements to ensure funds are spent on good causes, rather than on political campaigns.Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock said ""the farce of government lobbying government"" had to stop.Critics said the new rules, which begin in May, could be hard to enforce.The Cabinet Office said UK government departments gave the voluntary sector about £10bn in grants last year. The government says it wants to put into the official conditions that any UK government grants to organisations cannot be used for ""activity intended to influence - or attempt to influence - Parliament, government or political parties"".Under the rules charities would still be able to use privately-raised funds to campaign as they like. Mr Hancock said: ""The public sector never lobbies for lower taxes and less state spending, and it's a zero sum game if Peter is robbed to pay Paul.""But a senior charity source told the BBC it was an attack on freedom of speech. ""Charities are not only about Tiny Tim on his crutch, but espousing the cause of the disadvantaged,"" the source said.""That will sometimes be uncomfortable for any government.""BBC political reporter Alan Soady said exactly how such a rule would be enforced - and how charities would prove which pots of money funding for lobbying came from - was still unanswered.There was also some concern in Whitehall that some charities seemed to have been set up primarily to lobby, or that they were straying from their brief on the issues they lobbied on, he said.The move follows work by the right-of-centre think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) into so-called ""sock puppets"", where taxpayers' money is given to pressure groups which then campaign for policy changes or extra money.Chris Snowden, the organisation's head of lifestyle economics, said: ""At every level - local, national and European - people have been subsidising political campaigns that they may not know about and might disagree with.""Campaigning is an important part of a thriving democracy but charities and pressure groups should not be doing it with taxpayers' money.""Former Bishop of Oxford Lord Harries, who chairs a commission which has looked into charity lobbying - the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement - said the ""polarisation"" between charities' direct work and policies they wanted to change was ""very, very unhelpful"".Charities on the ""front line"" could often best identify where government policy was failing, and ""surely they are morally bound to tell the government they could improve their work to help, say, children in poverty?"" he said.Trying to separate where lobbying money came from would be a ""bureaucratic nonsense"", he added.Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations - an umbrella body for the voluntary sector in England - added his concern, warning that the ""draconian"" new rules could force charities to take a ""vow of silence"".""The new rules attached to grant income would appear to prevent charities from suggesting improvements or efficiencies to civil servants or ministers, or even from raising concerns with MPs, for example about the treatment of vulnerable people.""The system has been trialled in grants provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ministers insisted it had not curtailed the ability of charities such as Shelter from lobbying on housing legislation.

2016-02-05,Cameron gets Danish backing for EU deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35499139,"David Cameron has received Denmark's backing for his EU renegotiation after Poland said plans to limit benefits for migrants need ""further discussion"".Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen said plans for a brake on benefit payments were ""understandable and acceptable"" and he would be as ""supportive as possible"" to keep the UK in the EU.Mr Cameron is trying to garner support for an EU-wide deal in two weeks' time. He insisted any agreement would be ""legally binding and irreversible"".However, European Parliament president Martin Schulz has said he could not guarantee MEPs would ""adopt"" the welfare proposals without amendment and said they would be subject to months of debate, potentially delaying their implementation. Mr Cameron, who has spent the day in Poland and Denmark, has said he is making progress towards his goal of rewriting the terms of the UK's membership of the EU.He needs the backing of all 28 EU leaders for his draft renegotiation package and hopes to secure it at a summit on 18 and 19 February, thus paving the way for a UK referendum in June.Following talks in Copenhagen, Mr Rasmussen said Denmark - a country historically sceptical about the EU and which also retains its own currency - did not object to any of the UK's proposals and did not expect them to be significantly amended in the coming weeks.He said the EU needed to retain a ""strong British voice"". ""I truly believe that adopting this package will create a better Europe,"" he said.On the issue of welfare curbs, which is proving a stick point for a number of other EU members, Mr Rasmussen said individual members should be able to ""protect"" their national welfare systems from abuse.""It creates momentum towards the goal of ensuring that the EU does not develop into a social union,"" he said.""We need to ensure that EU citizens move across borders to work, not to seek a high level of benefits. ""The package also contains an emergency brake which is specifically designed to handle the particular problems faced by the UK in regard to in-work benefits. That is perfectly understandable and acceptable to us.""Poland and other members of the so-called Visegrad group - the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia - have expressed about the welfare restrictions, warning that it breaks freedom of movement rules and discriminates against their citizens.Poland could have been a difficult country for David Cameron to win over. With a million Poles working in the UK the prospect of new welfare curbs on EU workers has been particularly contentious in Warsaw. Politicians there have consistently warned against any measure that would cause discrimination.But now, on the table, is a proposal Poland seems set to support. After meeting David Cameron this morning, the leader of the governing Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said he was ""satisfied"" with the plans to reduce in-work benefits for four years and stressed the measure wouldn't affect Poles already living in Britain. Mr Kaczynski is a power-broker in Polish politics and said his country had gained ""very much"" from the negotiations, including the right of Polish workers in the UK to continue sending child benefit back home, albeit at a reduced rate.  Speaking after a meeting with the Danish prime minister in Copenhagen, a buoyant David Cameron sounded optimistic about sewing up a deal.After talks with Mr Cameron, Polish PM Beata Szydlo said she backed the UK's plans to boost national sovereignty and raise competitiveness but said the welfare needed to be ""ironed out"" to ensure Poles in the UK were not disadvantaged.""There are always topics that need to be ironed out,"" she told reporters. ""Over a million Poles live and work in Britain. Their work is growing Britain's GDP and we want them to enjoy the same kind of opportunities for development as Britons.""Mr Cameron said the talks were ""very good"" but acknowledged there was ""important detail to be filled in"". He stressed he was working towards a ""full strategic partnership"" between the two countries on a range of issues, including that of security, amid Polish concerns about the growth of Russian influence on its eastern flank and what Nato's response will be. Countries on the EU's eastern flank are to meet next week before providing a joint response to the reform package, Hungary's foreign minister said.The draft proposals were published by European Council president Donald Tusk on Tuesday after months of negotiations between UK and EU officials and pave the way for Britain's EU referendum to take place as early as June.An EU source close to the negotiations told the BBC the proposals had met initial resistance from many countries and Mr Cameron faced two weeks of ""difficult"" negotiations before the summit in Brussels.Referendum timeline: What will happen when?Guide: All you need to know about the referendumThe view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-05,Muslim women 'stopped in Labour bids',https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35504185,"A Muslim women's group has written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into ""systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors"".""They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered,"" it told BBC Newsnight.Labour said it had the best record of any of the parties in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates.As Mr Corbyn prepared to speak to the Association of Labour Councillors on Saturday, BBC Newsnight spoke to about a dozen Muslim women up and down the country.They appeared to point to a pattern of obstruction from within Labour Muslim ranks and back up Muslim Women's Network UK's complaints of sabotage.Optician Fozia Parveen claims her efforts to become a Labour councillor in Birmingham in 2008 were scuppered by men within the party.She said: ""At the time, I was aware of a smear campaign against me.""They said that I was having an affair with one of the existing councillors.""I was quite taken aback. People were turning up at my family home trying to intimidate my mum.""Ms Parveen said Muslim men told her mother to stop her from pursuing becoming a councillor.She added: ""It would be members of the local Labour Party. I didn't see them myself but my mum did say it was them.""Shazia Bashir was the first choice for Labour in a seat in Peterborough in 2007.She claims that when her father said he would not support her, Muslim men from within the local Labour Party made her step aside. They deny the claim.""Because I didn't have my father's consent and support, I had to step down. I was pressured into stepping down,"" said Ms Bashir, who was 31 and married with two children at the time.Jean Khote, a sitting Labour councillor in Leicester, said good women candidates were barred by the membership in some areas with high Muslim populations - and that was kept from people higher up the party.She said they would say there were not adequate candidates among the women, which she said was not true.""There were brilliant women on the panel. I've met them and had discussions with them,"" she added.Newsnight was told similar stories by other women who wished to remain anonymous.One said: ""They spread this slander about me... It's the way they get to you.""Another said she had been told by Labour members ""Islam and feminism aren't compatible"".An advocate for gay rights was told: ""This is un-Islamic. Leave that for white people."" And many spoke of being criticised for being too Westernised.Shaista Gohir, from Muslim Women's Network UK, told Newsnight the tight-knit patriarchal communities operate a system of clan politics known as ""biradari"", in which votes are delivered in blocks.    ""These men have a cultural mindset, which they've brought from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,"" she said.""They operate a biradari male kinship system and they've brought the system here. What I call an old boys' network.""They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered, because we will then challenge the status quo, challenge misogyny.""Muslim Women's Network UK has also written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling on him to launch an inquiry into the barriers to political participation of black and ethnic minority women.But Ms Gohir said: ""From our experience, Muslim women are most affected by Labour Muslim male councillors due to the latter's number in certain towns and cities.""Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats.""We have the best record of any party in selecting women and BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] candidates and we will continue to do all that we can to make sure candidates are representative of the communities they seek to represent,"" it said.""The Labour Party has a fair, democratic and robust procedure for selecting council candidates. Local Labour Party members select their local candidates within the party's rules and guidelines.""Those wishing to become Labour councillors are interviewed by an independent assessment team and unsuccessful candidates have a right of appeal to the regional party board.""You can see more on this story on Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 GMT on Friday."

2016-02-05,Row erupts between EU exit campaigns,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35501298,"A row has erupted between rival groups campaigning for Britain's exit from the European Union.Vote Leave and Leave.EU are vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign when David Cameron calls a referendum. Merger attempts appear to have been scuppered by personality clashes and differences over tactics.Labour MP Kate Hoey has quit Vote Leave but will continue to co-chair the Labour Leave campaign. A Labour Leave spokesman told the BBC it has now ended its affiliation to Vote Leave, an umbrella group which includes business leaders, Tory MPs and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell among others.But Labour Leave's founder John Mills, who remains Vote Leave deputy chairman, said in a tweet that it was still affiliated to the campaign and would continue to work with all leave campaigners.The latest bout of infighting was sparked by an internal letter leaked to The Times, by Mr Mills, a Labour donor, warning about ""damaging bickering"" at the top of Vote Leave.In his letter, Mr Mills says feuding in the group had prompted the Labour MP's departure.Ms Hoey is now supporting a third group, Grassroots Out, founded by two Conservative MPs and backed by Leave.EU, and is due to appear at a rally in Manchester later alongside UKIP leader Nigel Farage.In his letter Mr Mills also criticises Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, who was the campaign's director, until a shake-up this week saw him moved to a non-executive role, accusing him of generating ""ill-feeling"".Responding to Mr Mills' letter, a Vote Leave spokesperson said: ""Vote Leave is a genuinely cross-party campaign and we value our Labour Party MPs and supporters across the country.""In a separate development. Green Party London Assembly member Dame Jenny Jones tweeted ""will vote to leave #EU but cant work with an organisation with so little judgement as to put Lawson at its head,"" a reference to the appointment of Tory peer and climate change sceptic Lord Lawson as Vote Leave chairman.The Electoral Commission has the task of designating the official leave and remain campaigns, which will get access to £600,000 in public funds, TV broadcasts, free mailshots and a spending limit of £7m.The two main Leave groups differ on tactics and both are claiming to command more cross-party support - a crucial factor in getting the designation.Arron Banks, the UKIP donor who is bankrolling Leave.EU, has written to MPs to hit back at claims by Vote Leave that it is too focused on immigration, saying it is also stressing the positive benefits of quitting the 28 nation bloc.He also attacks Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful campaign against changing Britain's voting system in 2011's AV referendum, who also left Vote Leave's board this week for a non-executive role.""I wouldn't put them in charge of the local sweet shop,"" Mr Banks says of the pair.A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""We've seen the letter and we wish him (Banks) well.""One of the founders of the Grassroots Out, or GO, campaign told BBC News the leave side of the debate ""can't continue with all this bickering, there needs to be a coming together at some stage"". Conservative MP Tom Pursglove said: ""It can't carry on as we are. We need to focus on winning the referendum.""  He refused to say whether or not his group would be trying to win the official designation, but added: ""If we're in a position where we can bring people together at the top then that's something we will look at. We've shown we can do that at grassroots."" Speaking on his regular LBC radio phone-in, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he had tried to get the two campaigns to merge, but claims Vote Leave, which he describes as a ""Tory front"", ""refuse to work with anybody"".In a message to all UKIP members and supporters, Mr Farage said the party was now officially behind Grassroots Out.""With the unanimous support of our MEPs we now commit to supporting Grassroots Out and want our branches and members to join with GO as a means of working with activists from other parties and none."" He added: ""So let us organise and mobilise our people's army around the GO banner for this referendum.""The row has been seized on by the pro-EU group Britain Stronger in Europe, which claims the out campaign has ""descended into an all-out farce"".But exit campaigners say that group faces splits of its own, as the Scottish National Party will be running its own campaign and will not share a platform with David Cameron or other Conservatives arguing for Britain to stay in the EU."
2016-02-05,Public sector pay-offs face curbs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35507558,"The government is to look at more curbs on public sector redundancy payments as Chancellor George Osborne pledged to ""rein in"" sums paid to managers.A consultation will look at the case for limiting payoffs to three weeks salary per year of service and reducing the amount people are entitled to when they near retirement.The move follows a campaign by the Daily Mail against ""fat cat pay-offs"".Ministers have already pledged to cap individual payoffs at £95,000.The government says it wants to significantly reduce the cost to the taxpayer of public sector redundancy payments, which totalled about £6.5bn between 2011-12 and 2013-14.Freedom of Information requests by the Daily Mail and the Taxpayers' Alliance revealed that around 3,500 council employees across the UK earned more than £100,000 while one chief executive had an annual salary of almost £500,000.In new guidance, the government repeated that any public servant earning just over £140,000 - which is the amount the prime minister is paid - must have their salary authorised by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. But ministers also plan to press ahead with plans in the Conservative manifesto to cap redundancy payments at £95,000 and ban them when senior staff leave one public sector employer only to join another shortly afterwards. In a new consultation that will last three months, the government will look at the case for setting a standard formula for calculating what exit payments public sector mangers are entitled to, according to weeks worked or money earned over a certain period. Ministers also want to find out if there is support for preventing public sector employers offering their staff private health insurance and to taper the amount that executives can receive when they are approaching retirement.The Treasury said it wanted to the make exit compensation ""fairer, more modern and more consistent"".Mr Osborne told the Mail; ""Taxpayers foot the bill for the public sector and we've been determined that we take further action. We'll rein in unfair exit payments and issue new guidance across the public sector on the highest salaries.""The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said that as the squeeze on public sector budgets continues, ministers hope this plan can simultaneously save money and be popular. The £95,000 cap will apply, among other bodies, to the NHS, the police force, local authorities and schools. When the consultation was launched in August, the government said that the BBC, Channel 4, Bank of England, the Armed Forces, Royal Bank of Scotland and other taxpayer-owned banks would be among organisations exempt but ministers said they would expect such bodies to introduce ""their own, commensurate cap on exit payments"".Local authorities argue that retaining valued staff in senior roles doesn't come cheap. One council said it offered some employees private health cover ""to minimise absence from work due to sickness"". "
2016-02-05,UK brands Assange ruling 'ridiculous',https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35504237,"The UK foreign secretary has branded as ""ridiculous"" a UN panel's ruling that Julian Assange be allowed to go free, as the Wikileaks founder demanded the decision be respected.Mr Assange - who faces extradition to Sweden over a rape claim, which he denies - claimed asylum in London's Ecuadorean embassy in 2012.The panel said he had been ""arbitrarily detained"" and should get compensation.Philip Hammond rejected the decision, accusing Mr Assange of evading justice.Mr Assange hailed it as a ""significant victory"", but the UK government insisted the ruling was not legally binding and the report ""changes nothing"".The 44-year-old Australian was originally arrested in London in 2010 under a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden over rape and sexual assault allegations.Two years later, while on bail, he claimed asylum inside the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge. Reading a statement via a video link from the embassy, Mr Assange said the opinion of the panel was ""vindication"", adding: ""The lawfulness of my detention is now a matter of settled law.""He later addressed a crowd from a balcony at the Ecuadorean embassy, hailing the decision a ""victory of historical importance"". However, Mr Hammond said Mr Assange was a ""fugitive from justice"", adding that he can come out ""any time he chooses"" but will still have to face justice in Sweden. Anders Ronquist, legal chief at Sweden's foreign ministry, said Mr Assange ""is not being deprived of his liberty there due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities"". Elisabeth Massi Fritz, lawyer for the alleged rape victim, said the UN panel's decision was ""insulting and offensive"" to her client and was ""against all vulnerable victims' human rights"".Swedish prosecutors dropped an investigation into two sex assault claims against Mr Assange last year after running out of time to question him. However, he still faces the more serious accusation of rape.Mr Assange fears extradition to Sweden will lead to further extradition to the United States for questioning over the activities of Wikileaks, the website which has published secret documents and videos, including almost 400,000 US military logs.What next for Julian Assange?Who is Julian Assange?Julian Assange timelineHow unhealthy is living indoors?Mr Assange said the comments by Mr Hammond were ""beneath"" the minister's stature and ""insulting"" to the UN, while Ecuador's foreign minister criticised the UK for rejecting the panel's decision.Ricardo Patiño said the UK had violated ""important articles of the Universal Human Rights Convention and of the International Treaty on Political and Civil rights"".The whistleblower Edward Snowden, who is accused of espionage in the US and has received legal support from Wikileaks, tweeted that the UK and Sweden's response to the panel's decision ""writes a pass for every dictatorship to reject UN rulings"".   In September 2014, Mr Assange complained to the UN that he was being ""arbitrarily detained"" as he could not leave without being arrested.The complaint against the UK and Sweden claimed Mr Assange had been deprived of his liberty for an ""unacceptable length of time"".The UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention insisted Mr Assange's detention ""should be brought to an end, that his physical integrity and freedom of movement be respected"".The Wikileaks founder had been subjected to ""different forms of deprivation of liberty"" it said, initially while he was held in isolation at London's Wandsworth Prison for 10 days in 2010.The deprivation had been ""continuous"" since he was initially arrested in the UK on 7 December 2010.""Mr Assange should be afforded the right to compensation,"" it added.Three members of the five-person panel, which has made hundreds of rulings on whether imprisonment or detention is lawful since it was established in 1991, found in Mr Assange's favour.One rejected his claim and another did not take part in the investigation. The UK's permanent representative to the UN Julian Braithwaite has written to the panel expressing the government's surprise and disappointment with the outcome.Responding to criticism of the decision, Christophe Peschoux, from the UN, said: ""We can argue on the definition of detention or deprivation of liberty, but the fact is he's restricted against his will and his situation is one of detention since 2010 when he was first arrested."" He said the decision was not a ""ruling on the merits of the allegations that have been levelled against Mr Assange"" but he said the investigation was still in its ""preliminary stage"". ""And to the working group's knowledge the investigation has not proceeded and no charge has been filed,"" he added.  By Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondentJulian Assange and his supporters will see this as a significant moral victory.   The Wikileaks founder, who walked into the Ecuadorean Embassy after losing a series of appeals in British courts, now has an important panel of UN legal experts on his side.   Legally binding or not, a UN official said the decision was based on international law.   Although both Britain and Sweden are firmly sticking to their guns, they are now in an extremely awkward position.  The Swedish government has seized on the dissenting voice in the panel - who argued, as Britain does, that Mr Assange fled bail and was using the Ecuadorean embassy to evade arrest. The call for compensation for Mr Assange is particularly controversial when there is already public anger in the UK over the cost of policing his confinement at the embassy. "
2016-02-05,MP faces solicitor's harassment claim,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-35506120,"A married Conservative MP has been accused of harassing a former colleague when they worked at a London bank.Solicitor Patronia Campbell claims she shunned Huw Merriman's sexual advances 18 months after a one night stand, a tribunal heard.Ms Campbell alleges she was unfairly dismissed when she was made redundant from Lehman Brothers in 2014. Mr Merriman, MP for Bexhill and Battle and a former Lehman's Brothers manager, denies anything sexual happened.Ms Campbell is also bringing a case for harassment and victimisation against Mr Merriman, Lehman Brothers International and another managing director, Tim Parsons. The East London Employment Tribunal heard how one night in June 2011, Ms Campbell asked her friend, Simon Carter, if Mr Merriman could stay on his sofa.She was staying at Mr Carter's East London address while her home was renovated, the panel heard. In a statement, Mr Carter said: ""I met Mr Merriman briefly, offered him a glass of wine, chatted for a while then went to bed.""He said Ms Campbell and Mr Merriman were drunk and cooked something to eat. He said it was clear the two spent the night together and the next morning Mr Merriman emerged from the bathroom ""sheepishly"" in his pants.After he left, Mr Carter said Ms Campbell admitted he had stayed in her bed.The tribunal heard it was unlike Ms Campbell to have a ""casual fling"" but that she told Mr Carter she and Mr Merriman had a brief relationship some years back. Miss Campbell claims that 18 months later - at a work Christmas party in 2012 - Mr Merriman insinuated he wanted a sexual relationship.She claims she turned him down and that he began criticising and harassing her.Mr Merriman denies the one night stand but accepts he went to Mr Carter's house because he had missed the last train. The tribunal heard he claims ""nothing sexual transpired"" between him and Ms Campbell.The tribunal continues."

2016-02-05,German judges criticise EU trade plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35503885,"German judges have objected to a new court system for investors to sue governments, which would be set up as part of an EU-US trade deal.The German Association of Judges (DRB) said there was ""neither a legal basis nor an actual need for such a court"".But in response the European Commission said the Investment Court System (ICS) would not affect national or EU law.The role of commercial courts is one of the thorniest issues in the EU-US trade negotiations, known as TTIP.There are fears that big firms could put excessive legal pressure on states.The Commission abandoned the idea of using existing arbitration courts, called Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), because of the accusation that powerful multinationals use them to force changes in public policy.Rejecting the German judges' criticisms, a Commission trade spokesman told the BBC that the new ICS plan was based on input from parliaments in the EU and other stakeholders.""The ICS only rules on matters of international law, contained in the agreement.  It does not rule on member state law or EU law, and hence the ICS in no way alters the established court system within the EU,"" spokesman Joseph Waldstein said.He said ICS proceedings would be transparent, with fully qualified judges and a right to appeal.National and EU laws offer more protections for investors, he said, so they would be ""unlikely to need to go to the ICS system"".TTIP stands for Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The Commission hopes to complete the wide-ranging talks by the summer, to avoid the disruption of the US presidential election. Why the TTIP deal mattersThe thorny issue of trade arbitration will be on the agenda of EU-US talks later this month.There is widespread concern about the ""chilling"" effect that company lawsuits can have on governments trying to legislate on public health or the environment.Critics point to the example of tobacco giant Philip Morris, which sued the authorities in Australia and Uruguay over plain cigarette packaging.According to Mr Waldstein, the new ICS courts will ""protect"" - not undermine - governments' right to regulate. Germany's DRB - representing 16,000 judges and prosecutors - said (in German) that ""creating special courts for certain groups of litigants"" would be a mistake.The proposed ICS would limit the legal powers of EU member states and change national court systems, the DRB statement said.The Commission's proposal would mean ICS jurisdiction that ""extends from civil law through to general administrative law and social and tax legislation"", the judges complained.They also questioned the legal criteria for appointing judges to the ICS courts, saying specialists in trade disputes would have an unfair advantage. Nearly 3.3 million people have signed an online petition against the proposed trade deal, on the Stop TTIP website.The Commission and many politicians argue that TTIP would bring major benefits for the US and Europe, creating new jobs and business opportunities.A study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) estimated the potential gains for the EU as up to €119bn (£91.5bn; $133bn) a year and €95bn for the US."

He was on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee and was a parliamentary aide to shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy. Mr Harpham was elected after former home secretary David Blunkett announced his intention to stand down at the 2015 election. He won the seat with a majority of 13,807.More on this and other stories from South YorkshireLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Mr Harpham, describing him as ""a proud socialist"" who was ""dedicated to justice for working people"".  In a statement, Mr Corbyn added: ""Despite the undoubted hardship that his support for the miners' strike would have caused him, as it did many thousands of miners, Harry recently told me he would have done it all again. ""To the very end he was fighting for working people in parliament. What a decent man he was and he will be sadly missed by all his friends in the Labour Party.""Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson tweeted: ""Deeply upset to learn of Harry Harpham's death. Sheffield has lost a wonderful MP. My thoughts are with his family.""Mr Blunkett said Mr Harpham had ""given his life to the improvement of life for others"".He said: ""I shall remember him as someone who was a fighter for fairness and justice and I am really, really sad that after just nine months we've lost him.""A book of condolence has been opened at Sheffield Town Hall. Councillor Julie Dore, leader of Sheffield council, said: ""It's difficult to express in words how sad this news is. ""I feel privileged to have known and worked alongside Harry, he was not only a loyal colleague but a valued friend, who dedicated his life to fighting for what he believed in."" Mr Harpham's final contribution in the House of Commons came on 20 January at Prime Minister's Questions.Addressing the issue of job losses at Sheffield Forgemasters, he accused the government of ""warm words, hand-wringing and some crocodile tears"" over a ""tsunami of losses in the steel industry"". Mr Harpham leaves behind his wife Gill and children Annie, Kieron, Dan, Emily and Victoria."

Interpreters had made that request, he added.Thousands of interpreters and translators work in EU institutions, to cope with 24 official languages.The parliament has about 330 staff interpreters and 1,800 freelancers.In addition, the parliament employs about 700 translators, who translate more than 100,000 pages each month.The most recent languages to be made official were Croatian (in 2013), Irish, Bulgarian and Romanian (all in 2007).Interpreters translate orally, in real time. But Mr Welle said some were overburdened and others under-employed. ""The average amount of time in the interpreter's booth is 10 hours... But we need more fairness between interpreters - the individual tally varies between six and 16 hours in the booth,"" Mr Welle said.The scope of translation work in the EU was unique, he said. ""Even at the UN you only have interpretation in six languages.""""It's also extremely important for interpreters that people speak their own language,"" he told the parliament's budgetary control committee. ""If they speak a foreign language the quality of interpretation goes down. You hear interpreters making requests to you: 'Please speak more slowly, speak your own language.'""The parliament's budget for interpreters is €45m and another €9m for translations done externally. The European Commission - where EU laws are drafted - has 600 staff interpreters and 3,000 freelance interpreters. The Commission's total staff is about 33,000."

2016-02-05,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet.

2016-02-05,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-05,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-05,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-05,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-05,Collectors' item?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35474095,"I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - ""Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008""); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect). And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. ""John 4 leader"", it says.I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.He's struck ""absolutely the right note"" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his ""rigidity"". Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is ""obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago"" and ""didn't want to listen, didn't want to change"".Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the ""prawn cocktail offensive"" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes. Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010. I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's ""easy to deal with"". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.      Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading ""a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us"".For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes: Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.So I'll put the ""John 4 leader"" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case."
2016-02-05,Albion Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35470281,"Britain could take the road that leads out of Europe - or, to be more precise, the EU - in just 139 days' time. If that is to happen, who will drive the decision? The answer highlights some significant divisions in British society.Prof John Curtice, pretty much the only poll watcher to emerge from the last election with his reputation enhanced, says that ""those who want to leave the European Union are demographically very distinctive - most distinctive of all are those who have relatively little in the way of educational qualifications"". The figures from the most recent British Social Attitudes survey in 2014 are stark. Just 35% of those who have no qualifications want to remain in the EU compared with 78% of those with university degrees. If you travel to Albion Street in the market town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, it's pretty clear why. To many of the people who work here, the EU looks like a club that doesn't much want them as members. It appears to be run by wealthy, well-educated men in suits for wealthy, well-educated men in suits. Julie McLeod, 46, who works at Brown & Wenman opticians, is typical of the sort of voter who could take us out of the EU. ""I'm a bit sceptical really of the whole Europe thing. I think they control too much of our laws,"" she told me. ""You want a situation where the British government can decide what the British government wants to do. We need a bit more say.""Julie, like many women voters, has not yet decided for certain how she'll vote. If Leave is to win, they need to convince many more people like her that the benefits of quitting outweigh the risks. Like so many others, immigration - and our government's inability to control it - is what bothers her most. Next door on Albion Street, shopkeeper Tim Smart spells out how he believes the recent influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has affected him, his family and his town. He complains that those who come here have an unfair advantage as not only do they speak their own languages but they go to English schools and learn to speak English as well. ""If they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position anywhere, who would you employ? Someone who speaks two languages or someone who speaks one language? My daughter has just had it in Northampton, funnily enough. It doesn't feel like a level playing field in my eyes.""Tim speaks for those who believe that immigration control is not simply a question of the country being too full, or of race or religion, but is a question of fairness.It is people like him who David Cameron has in mind when he talks of ending ""something for nothing"" by limiting the in-work benefits EU migrants can get. It was a proposal that emerged from intensive polling and countless focus groups, although so far he's had to water the idea down.Another sign that you may well be in favour of leaving the EU is your age. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to get out. It's an irony that the one group that have already had a vote on Europe - anyone aged 58 or older who could have voted when the last referendum was held in 1975 - are precisely the people who now want another chance to reverse the decision taken back then.The British Social Attitudes survey shows that almost half - 46% - of those over 55 want to get out while half that number - 23% - of those under 35 agree with them.Speaking to Kenneth Spinks, who's 85, you get a sense of why. He feels that he was invited to vote to join an economic club in which it was easier and cheaper to buy and sell things - the Common Market as it was known then - and has instead found himself governed by a big, bossy, bureaucratic organisation in Brussels.I spoke to him in the local Conservative Club. One more sign that you might be a Leaver is that you voted Conservative at the last election. Tory voters are much less likely to be pro-EU than those of other parties - other than UKIP, of course. That is why the draft deal David Cameron unveiled this week matters so much. Many Conservative voters - the people who backed the prime minister just last May - will be inclined to follow his lead just as Labour voters followed Harold Wilson's back in 1975. Kenneth couldn't have been clearer that he wants to quit Europe until we had this exchange.Me: ""You're a staunch Tory man, but even if the Tory leader says, 'I want us to stay in, I think it's in the best interest of the country,' you'd vote against him, would you?Kenneth: ""Well, it's all according to what he'll come back with. If he'll come back with something that's really good, it might sway me a bit.""Take a few more paces along Albion Street and you'll find the last crucial group of potential ""leavers"" - small businesspeople who, unlike those who run big companies, don't export to Europe but do still have to put up with its rules.Aaron Lee, 28, who runs Lee & Sons Cleaning Services, says:  ""All we're doing is paying out fortunes of money to join this trading union, and being told what we can and can't do. ""For example, we can only use a certain power Hoover because they've governed the power rating down. Where we could Hoover a floor in an hour, it's now going to take us two.""The Leave campaign cannot win simply by building a coalition of old, non graduate, self-employed voters. They will need - and, indeed, already have - support from younger, well-educated people who work for big businesses too. However, it is these divisions in society that could determine the future of our country for decades to come.The Today programme will be running a separate piece later on which voters are most likely to vote for the UK to remain in the EU."
2016-02-05,Will EU deal deliver?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35486520,"Cutting immigration, curbing benefits and returning powers from Brussels are among the key aims of David Cameron's EU reform deal, but will any of it work in practice?David Cameron fought hard to get a four year ban on new arrivals from other EU nations claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, which top up low wages.It will not be a blanket ban, as he had wanted, but will be graduated, so the longer migrants work in the UK, the more benefits they will become entitled to. The prime minister insists this will ""make a difference"" to high levels of immigration by reducing one of the main ""pull factors"" attracting people to the UK.But there is little direct evidence to suggest it will work.Sir Stephen Nickell, a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year he believed it was ""unlikely to have a huge impact"".The main ""pull factor"" for migrants is the availability of jobs, according to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, and campaign group Migration Watch.Benefits might prove to be an attraction to some, but most EU-born migrant workers are single or childless couples who do not claim a lot of tax credits, researchers say.Migration Watch said Mr Cameron's ""emergency brake"" on benefits would be ""unlikely to have any significant effect on levels of migration"".Some campaigners have suggested that increasing the amount of benefits people can receive each year will encourage them to remain in Britain.The in-work benefit ban was dreamed up by influential think tank Open Europe (its former boss Mats Persson is now Mr Cameron's chief adviser on EU reform).It argued in a November 2014 paper, that banning in-work benefits would mean take-home pay could drop below that which migrants would receive in their home states - they used Poland, Bulgaria and Spain as their examples - meaning that a move to the UK would no longer make financial sense.But the UK's plan to increase its minimum wage to £9 an hour for over-25s by 2020, which the government claims will remove the need to top-up wages with benefits, could undermine that argument.Also, it is not clear how checks would be made on how long people have actually been in the UK. Some regularly travel in and out of the UK or return to their home country to see family for a few months at a time.Asked whether Mr Cameron believed the proposed 'emergency brake' will cut immigration, a Downing Street spokesman said that migrant families were currently able to claim an average of £6,000 a year in tax credits and some 10,000 were claiming £10,000 or more.The UK spends about £30m a year on child benefit payments for children that do not live in the UK. About 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin.A majority of those payments go to children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.David Cameron wanted to change EU rules to end this, but instead he has been offered a deal under which child benefit will be paid in line with the wages in the country where the child is living.UK child benefit is £20.40 a week for the first child, about 5% of the average income. Under the proposed new rules, that might be reduced to £3.50 for a child living in Romania, where wages are low.But it might also mean the UK will pay higher levels of child benefit for than it currently does for children living in countries with higher average wages.There are also concerns that the Department for Work and Pensions will struggle to cope with calculating 28 different rates of child benefit, for each member state.Officials have also told the BBC they are unsure how they can be certain where the children of migrants are resident. David Cameron secured a clear legal statement that the UK was not committed to further political integration and that the phrase ""ever closer union"" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties. He also got new powers for national parliaments to band together to block unwanted EU laws - but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used. The ""red card"" procedure can only be triggered if at least 15 national Parliaments, representing 55% of the EU's population, agree.London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would be better if the UK was able to block EU laws on its own without having to rely on the support of other EU nations.In response to Mr Johnson's concerns, Mr Cameron revealed on Wednesday that he is planning to announced a measure that will put the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament ""beyond doubt"".Eurosceptic Tory MPs are pushing for a repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to assert that UK law has primacy over EU law. But critics say this would be tantamount to leaving the EU.Instead, the government is looking at ways of asserting parliamentary sovereignty that would question and challenge EU decisions but without causing constitutional chaos.There is speculation Mr Cameron will make some kind of unilateral declaration of sovereignty, at the same time as he concludes his negotiations over Britain's reformed relationship with the EU.And that he will use this to persuade Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU since this is an issue on which the mayor has campaigned for many months.Downing Street is refusing to give details of the proposals which are being worked on by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice. But Mr Cameron gave a hint last year in his November 10 Chatham House speech when he said ministers were looking at the way Germany used its constitutional court to test EU law.He said then: ""The Constitutional Court in Germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to Europe. And it also reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers, or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."""
2016-02-05,Facing facts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35482638,"""To be, or not to be together, that is the question which must be answered."" The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk reaches for his Shakespeare to stress the enormity of the decision before us. He doesn't spell out that Hamlet is pondering a big existential question - whether or not to kill himself, and so risk an eternity in hell. He may well think that leaving the EU is the global equivalent of being cut off from God's love in a fiery pit for all time. But the quote is not propitious. Hamlet of course, does not kill himself. But he and almost everyone else ends up dead, sprawled across the stage. I am sure it is an unintended irony that the only person left alive to survey the tragedy is young Fortinbras from Norway, a country that these days is outside the EU.There will enough words, wild and whirling, from me and others on the deal and the UK position. For now I want to look at the big picture of what the deal says about the state of the European Union itself and where it is heading. In tabloid speak ""How EU feeling?""After all the EU is in precarious crisis, its purpose and even existence in question, even without the threat of an important member leaving the club.The flood of migration has highlighted the EU's inability to reach swift decisions and its inability to implement them.  Like Hamlet it reflects, and dithers and debates rather than acts. But it makes the hesitant Prince of Denmark look like a ninja assassin. It has rendered the precious passport area ""more honoured in the breach than the observance"" to coin a phrase. It has narrowly avoided seeing a country chucked out of the Euro, leaving fundamental dangers and flaws behind the Greek crisis unsolved.  The Ukraine crisis raises huge questions about the EU's geographical limits and identity.  The need to have Turkey onside underscores them.In nearly every country we see the continued growth of parties which stress national self-interest over some common European destiny, and doubt the worth of the EU.For the first time in my life it is not hard to imagine the European Union slowly falling apart.Cheer or weep, that's huge, because no one knows what would follow.Read more:The danger for Mr Cameron is that while back at home some will claim he has won only a handful of worthless glass beads, other presidents and prime ministers may feel they have showered him with precious jewels.The deal may not be a pivotal point in the argument about the UK's membership but it is an interesting recognition of reality by the European Union itself, a bucket of cold water thrown over some of its aspirations. The French and Dutch ""no"" vote to the European constitution in 2005 were the high water mark of European federalism. These documents don't confirm that the political romantic dream of a super-national state is dead. They do suggest that it is lying down in a darkened room, not quite feeling itself.One important paragraph suggests that ""ever closer union"" is about a warm friendly feeling, not ""political integration"". Another acknowledges the Euro is not the only currency in operation, and two states need not join, and that their interests count too.The ""red card"" is vacuous, but a symbolic recognition that national Parliaments matter. There is a breach in the idea of equal treatment of workers, while arguing there isn't.There has been a lot of tosh talked over the years about a two-speed or two-tier Europe. In fact for ages the reality has been a multi-speed Europe, different countries joining in different parts of the project. There is a rather nice, pointed, passage in these documents where all the UK's opt-outs and exceptions are listed. There are six such protocols. If the EU has multiple orbits, Britain is Neptune, on the outer reaches of the solar system.This deal accepts that is fine.  It does not treat the UK's opt-outs as a perversion to be overcome by long and patient therapy, but a fact. It accepts the UK will continue to be a friend with benefits, and a white wedding isn't going to happen.  It doesn't encourage others to adopt the same position but it leaves the possibility open. If the UK leaves it will be an earth-shattering moment for the EU. The huge fundamental questions about its purpose will be asked afresh, with great angst. It will be diminished on the world stage, and be full of the forlorn questioning of the self-worth of the spurned lover. But if the UK stays, Mr Tusk's fundamental question remains. What is it the EU wants to be, if it is to be?At its heart is a paradox. Intellectually and rationally those who argue that the answer is more Europe have a point. More central authority, with a stronger common police and border force, and the ability to overrule individual countries would be one way out of the crisis. It just wouldn't be very palatable or democratic. Most economists, and indeed the British Government, acknowledge the Euro countries need deeper fiscal and economic integration. The trouble isn't merely that this goes right against the mood of the voters for less Europe. It goes against the mood of many national governments too - fed up being bossed, not by Brussels, but Berlin.It is very hard to see past this conundrum - Hamlet didn't only dither because of a fundamental flaw - but because all the available answers were the bad ones."
2016-02-05,Campaigner Cameron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160206045237/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35476204,"It comprises 17 pages of closely argued legal jargon, diplomatic ambiguity and square brackets. The contents are dismissed by critics as a ""pint-sized package"" that fails to match the prime minister's lofty ambition of fundamental reform. It is a draft text that oozes with the obfuscation of old-style EU fudge. There are paragraphs of compromise that fail to meet the promises of the Conservative manifesto. The newspapers look down sniffily and ask: ""Is that it?"" Tory MPs mutter to one another in the corridors of Westminster, unable to hide their disappointment. One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of ""polishing a poo"". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders. And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain ""better off, more secure, more prosperous"". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the ""best of worlds"" and that was ""something worth fighting for"".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed. But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive. And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat. So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today. And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling. They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month. But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave. It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak. So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal. But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating. In other words, the referendum campaign has begun. "

They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels. However the government will hope it will sound good in terms of wrestling back powers from Brussels to the UK - and to other EU countries.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumReferendum timeline: What will happen when?Q&A: What does Britain want from Europe?More: BBC News EU referendum special"

2016-02-06,New rules 'will silence' charities,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35509117,"Charities have said new rules on how they spend government grants amount to making them take a vow of silence.From May, charities and organisations will no longer be allowed to spend taxpayers' money on lobbying ministers.The Cabinet Office said the new clause in grants would mean funds go to good causes, not political campaigns.Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said it was an ""insane policy"" that would not work in reality.""Take a service charity funded to run a helpline. They may well be dealing with ex-servicemen, there will be policy issues that emerge from that. They're not allowed to tell the government?"" he told the BBC.""The other reason is, if you've got mixed funding, how are you going to know which is the government's and somebody else's?""The ""draconian"" move  was ""tantamount to making charities take a vow of silence"", he added. Under the new conditions , which only apply to grants from central UK government departments, organisations will not be able to use grants for ""activity intended to influence - or attempt to influence - Parliament, government or political parties"". However charities will still be able to use privately-raised funds to campaign as they like. Christopher Snowden, from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a right-of-centre think tank, agrees with the changes.""It's not about silencing charities, it's not about stopping charities - whether they get public money or not -  from speaking out, of course they should do, it's very important that they campaign and lobby for the things that are important to them,"" he told the BBC.""It's specifically about the money that they get from government and how that is spent.""Cabinet Office Minister Matthew Hancock said: ""Taxpayers' money must be spent on improving people's lives and spreading opportunities, not wasted on the farce of government lobbying government.""These common sense rules will protect freedom of speech - but taxpayers won't be made to foot the bill for political campaigning and political lobbying.However, Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons Health Select Committee, posted on Twitter: ""Ending charities ability to lobby ministers wld have serious consequences for #publichealth Balance already distorted in favour of industry.""According to a House of Commons briefing, the estimated total income of the UK voluntary sector (not including charities) in 2012-13 was £40bn, of which £13bn came from government grants.The Cabinet Office said UK government departments gave the voluntary sector just under £10bn in grants last year. BBC political reporter Alan Soady said exactly how the new rules would be enforced - and how charities would prove which pots of money funding for lobbying came from - was still unanswered.There was also some concern in Whitehall that some charities seemed to have been set up primarily to lobby, or that they were straying from their brief on the issues they lobbied on, he said.The move follows research by the IEA into so-called ""sock puppets"", where taxpayers' money is given to pressure groups which then campaign for policy changes or extra money.Former Bishop of Oxford Lord Harries, who chairs a commission which has looked into charity lobbying - the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement - said the ""polarisation"" between charities' direct work and policies they wanted to change was ""very, very unhelpful"".Charities on the ""front line"" could often best identify where government policy was failing, and ""surely they are morally bound to tell the government they could improve their work to help, say, children in poverty?"" he said.The system has been trialled in grants provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ministers insisted it had not curtailed the ability of charities such as Shelter from lobbying on housing legislation.

2016-02-06,Councils should run services - Corbyn,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35508740,"Councils should be able to run utilities in their areas as part of moves to ""roll back the tide"" of privatisation, Jeremy Corbyn has said.Privatisation of services has made them less accountable, the Labour leader told a conference in Nottingham.He said English councils should have similar powers to cities on the continent, where local authorities have control of water and energy services.A Conservative spokesman said such a move would ""hurt working people"".Mr Corbyn's support for public ownership and anti-austerity message are at the centre of Labour's campaign for May's local elections in England. He told the Association of Labour Councillors conference he wants councils to become ""public entrepreneurs"" with greater freedom to spend taxpayers' money and to borrow to fund investment and public services.Mr Corbyn, who has already set out plans to take the railways back into public ownership, said he would back local authorities to take control of utilities and other services in their area.""Privatisation isn't just about who runs a service, it's about who services are accountable to,"" he said. ""It's about who shares the rewards, about protecting the workforce and getting a good deal for local people who use the services.""After a generation of forced privatisation and outsourcing of public services, the evidence has built up that handing services over to private companies routinely delivers poorer quality, higher cost, worse terms and conditions for the workforce, less transparency and less say for the public.""We will give councils greater freedoms to roll back the tide of forced privatisation. ""It locks people out of decision-making, makes services less accountable, too often means a bad deal for taxpayers, a bad deal for communities and a bad deal for those that work in the services too.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is another example of how the Labour Party will hurt working people by racking up more debt and increasing taxes to pay for it - driving up the cost of living for working families.""That's why Labour are a threat to our economic security and every working family's security. The Conservatives will continue to deliver stability, security and opportunity for working people.""Mr Corbyn also said that remaining in the European Union was in the best interests of the British people. However, he said he wants to see further reforms in Brussels, including stronger workers' rights and an end to the pressure to privatise public services.The speech comes as it emerged a Muslim women's group has written to Mr Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into ""systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors"".Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats."

She has pledged to ensure Scotland Stronger in Europe makes a ""positive, factual, people-based"" case for the EU.The UK-wide campaigns to leave the EU have not yet set up Scottish operations.Scotland Stronger in Europe, which is the Scottish arm of Britain Stronger in Europe, will formally launch later this week.It will be headquartered in Glasgow, and has said its advisory group will be gender balanced and include people from both sides of the independence referendum debate. It will not contain any serving politicians, recognising the intentions of several parties to run their own campaigns.Prof Siddiqui said: ""The campaign to show that Scotland is better off in Europe will be positive, factual and people-based - making the case that our quality of life is better and horizons broader by keeping our place in the European Union. ""We will be working extremely hard to contribute to a UK-wide vote to stay in Europe, whenever the referendum is called.""Prof Siddiqui is a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, holds four honorary doctorates, and an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Scottish Architects for her contribution to public life. In 2011, she was awarded an OBE for her contribution to interfaith services. In 2015, she was named in the Debretts top 500 list of the most influential people in the UK. Scotland Stronger in Europe has previously named former SNP spin doctor Kevin Pringle as its communications head and former Motherwell and Wishaw Labour MP Frank Roy as its campaign director.And it has said John Edward, a former head of the European Parliament office in Scotland, will be its chief campaign spokesman.In Scotland, the SNP, Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Greens all back the UK remaining part of the EU, with only UKIP opposed.However, there are dissenting voices within the parties, with former Labour MP Nigel Griffiths heading a Scottish Labour Leave campaign and former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars saying he will campaign for the UK to leave the EU.Polls have suggested that Scottish voters are generally more in favour of remaining in the EU than those elsewhere in the UK.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told BBC Scotland last week that it was a ""great myth that somehow Scotland's wonderfully in love with the European Union"" and claimed there had been ""precious little debate on this issue in Scotland"".Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017, and is reported to favour a poll on 23 June.However, the exact timing hinges on whether EU leaders agree at a summit next month to the draft package of reforms that was published last week.The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged Mr Cameron not to hold an EU referendum in June, saying it will ""distract"" from devolved elections taking place in May."

""That's why I can give a commitment that I will publish these documents in time for Scottish parliamentary scrutiny and before the Scottish Parliament dissolves.""The Scottish finance secretary said he wanted to see a framework that is fair to Scottish and to UK taxpayers.And Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said there had been significant movement from the UK Government in an attempt to find agreement.He added: ""Ministers at Holyrood will be shielded from a significant amount of risk - while still keeping all the money they take in income tax from Scottish taxpayers.""And we will review the framework after a few years to make absolutely sure it is delivering for Scotland and the rest of the UK."""

People were turning up at my family home trying to intimidate my mum.""Ms Parveen said Muslim men told her mother to stop her from pursuing becoming a councillor.She added: ""It would be members of the local Labour Party. I didn't see them myself but my mum did say it was them.""Shazia Bashir was the first choice for Labour in a seat in Peterborough in 2007.She claims that when her father said he would not support her, Muslim men from within the local Labour Party made her step aside. They deny the claim.""Because I didn't have my father's consent and support, I had to step down. I was pressured into stepping down,"" said Ms Bashir, who was 31 and married with two children at the time.Jean Khote, a sitting Labour councillor in Leicester, said good women candidates were barred by the membership in some areas with high Muslim populations - and that was kept from people higher up the party.She said they would say there were not adequate candidates among the women, which she said was not true.""There were brilliant women on the panel. I've met them and had discussions with them,"" she added.Newsnight was told similar stories by other women who wished to remain anonymous.One said: ""They spread this slander about me... It's the way they get to you.""Another said she had been told by Labour members ""Islam and feminism aren't compatible"".An advocate for gay rights was told: ""This is un-Islamic. Leave that for white people."" And many spoke of being criticised for being too Westernised.Shaista Gohir, from Muslim Women's Network UK, told Newsnight the tight-knit patriarchal communities operate a system of clan politics known as ""biradari"", in which votes are delivered in blocks.    ""These men have a cultural mindset, which they've brought from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,"" she said.""They operate a biradari male kinship system and they've brought the system here. What I call an old boys' network.""They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered, because we will then challenge the status quo, challenge misogyny.""Muslim Women's Network UK has also written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling on him to launch an inquiry into the barriers to political participation of black and ethnic minority women.But Ms Gohir said: ""From our experience, Muslim women are most affected by Labour Muslim male councillors due to the latter's number in certain towns and cities.""Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats.""We have the best record of any party in selecting women and BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] candidates and we will continue to do all that we can to make sure candidates are representative of the communities they seek to represent,"" it said.""The Labour Party has a fair, democratic and robust procedure for selecting council candidates. Local Labour Party members select their local candidates within the party's rules and guidelines.""Those wishing to become Labour councillors are interviewed by an independent assessment team and unsuccessful candidates have a right of appeal to the regional party board.""You can see more on this story on Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 GMT on Friday."

He insisted any agreement would be ""legally binding and irreversible"".However, European Parliament president Martin Schulz has said he could not guarantee MEPs would ""adopt"" the welfare proposals without amendment and said they would be subject to months of debate, potentially delaying their implementation. Mr Cameron, who has spent the day in Poland and Denmark, has said he is making progress towards his goal of rewriting the terms of the UK's membership of the EU.He needs the backing of all 28 EU leaders for his draft renegotiation package and hopes to secure it at a summit on 18 and 19 February, thus paving the way for a UK referendum in June.Following talks in Copenhagen, Mr Rasmussen said Denmark - a country historically sceptical about the EU and which also retains its own currency - did not object to any of the UK's proposals and did not expect them to be significantly amended in the coming weeks.He said the EU needed to retain a ""strong British voice"". ""I truly believe that adopting this package will create a better Europe,"" he said.On the issue of welfare curbs, which is proving a stick point for a number of other EU members, Mr Rasmussen said individual members should be able to ""protect"" their national welfare systems from abuse.""It creates momentum towards the goal of ensuring that the EU does not develop into a social union,"" he said.""We need to ensure that EU citizens move across borders to work, not to seek a high level of benefits. ""The package also contains an emergency brake which is specifically designed to handle the particular problems faced by the UK in regard to in-work benefits. That is perfectly understandable and acceptable to us.""Poland and other members of the so-called Visegrad group - the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia - have expressed about the welfare restrictions, warning that it breaks freedom of movement rules and discriminates against their citizens.Poland could have been a difficult country for David Cameron to win over. With a million Poles working in the UK the prospect of new welfare curbs on EU workers has been particularly contentious in Warsaw. Politicians there have consistently warned against any measure that would cause discrimination.But now, on the table, is a proposal Poland seems set to support. After meeting David Cameron this morning, the leader of the governing Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said he was ""satisfied"" with the plans to reduce in-work benefits for four years and stressed the measure wouldn't affect Poles already living in Britain. Mr Kaczynski is a power-broker in Polish politics and said his country had gained ""very much"" from the negotiations, including the right of Polish workers in the UK to continue sending child benefit back home, albeit at a reduced rate.  Speaking after a meeting with the Danish prime minister in Copenhagen, a buoyant David Cameron sounded optimistic about sewing up a deal.After talks with Mr Cameron, Polish PM Beata Szydlo said she backed the UK's plans to boost national sovereignty and raise competitiveness but said the welfare needed to be ""ironed out"" to ensure Poles in the UK were not disadvantaged.""There are always topics that need to be ironed out,"" she told reporters. ""Over a million Poles live and work in Britain. Their work is growing Britain's GDP and we want them to enjoy the same kind of opportunities for development as Britons.""Mr Cameron said the talks were ""very good"" but acknowledged there was ""important detail to be filled in"". He stressed he was working towards a ""full strategic partnership"" between the two countries on a range of issues, including that of security, amid Polish concerns about the growth of Russian influence on its eastern flank and what Nato's response will be. Countries on the EU's eastern flank are to meet next week before providing a joint response to the reform package, Hungary's foreign minister said.The draft proposals were published by European Council president Donald Tusk on Tuesday after months of negotiations between UK and EU officials and pave the way for Britain's EU referendum to take place as early as June.An EU source close to the negotiations told the BBC the proposals had met initial resistance from many countries and Mr Cameron faced two weeks of ""difficult"" negotiations before the summit in Brussels.Referendum timeline: What will happen when?Guide: All you need to know about the referendumThe view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"

A Labour Leave spokesman told the BBC it has now ended its affiliation to Vote Leave, an umbrella group which includes business leaders, Tory MPs and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell among others.But Labour Leave's founder John Mills, who remains Vote Leave deputy chairman, said in a tweet that it was still affiliated to the campaign and would continue to work with all leave campaigners.The latest bout of infighting was sparked by an internal letter leaked to The Times, by Mr Mills, a Labour donor, warning about ""damaging bickering"" at the top of Vote Leave.In his letter, Mr Mills says feuding in the group had prompted the Labour MP's departure.Ms Hoey is now supporting a third group, Grassroots Out, founded by two Conservative MPs and backed by Leave.EU, and is due to appear at a rally in Manchester later alongside UKIP leader Nigel Farage.In his letter Mr Mills also criticises Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, who was the campaign's director, until a shake-up this week saw him moved to a non-executive role, accusing him of generating ""ill-feeling"".Responding to Mr Mills' letter, a Vote Leave spokesperson said: ""Vote Leave is a genuinely cross-party campaign and we value our Labour Party MPs and supporters across the country.""In a separate development. Green Party London Assembly member Dame Jenny Jones tweeted ""will vote to leave #EU but cant work with an organisation with so little judgement as to put Lawson at its head,"" a reference to the appointment of Tory peer and climate change sceptic Lord Lawson as Vote Leave chairman.The Electoral Commission has the task of designating the official leave and remain campaigns, which will get access to £600,000 in public funds, TV broadcasts, free mailshots and a spending limit of £7m.The two main Leave groups differ on tactics and both are claiming to command more cross-party support - a crucial factor in getting the designation.Arron Banks, the UKIP donor who is bankrolling Leave.EU, has written to MPs to hit back at claims by Vote Leave that it is too focused on immigration, saying it is also stressing the positive benefits of quitting the 28 nation bloc.He also attacks Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful campaign against changing Britain's voting system in 2011's AV referendum, who also left Vote Leave's board this week for a non-executive role.""I wouldn't put them in charge of the local sweet shop,"" Mr Banks says of the pair.A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""We've seen the letter and we wish him (Banks) well.""One of the founders of the Grassroots Out, or GO, campaign told BBC News the leave side of the debate ""can't continue with all this bickering, there needs to be a coming together at some stage"". Conservative MP Tom Pursglove said: ""It can't carry on as we are. We need to focus on winning the referendum.""  He refused to say whether or not his group would be trying to win the official designation, but added: ""If we're in a position where we can bring people together at the top then that's something we will look at. We've shown we can do that at grassroots."" Speaking on his regular LBC radio phone-in, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he had tried to get the two campaigns to merge, but claims Vote Leave, which he describes as a ""Tory front"", ""refuse to work with anybody"".In a message to all UKIP members and supporters, Mr Farage said the party was now officially behind Grassroots Out.""With the unanimous support of our MEPs we now commit to supporting Grassroots Out and want our branches and members to join with GO as a means of working with activists from other parties and none."" He added: ""So let us organise and mobilise our people's army around the GO banner for this referendum.""The row has been seized on by the pro-EU group Britain Stronger in Europe, which claims the out campaign has ""descended into an all-out farce"".But exit campaigners say that group faces splits of its own, as the Scottish National Party will be running its own campaign and will not share a platform with David Cameron or other Conservatives arguing for Britain to stay in the EU."
2016-02-06,Public sector pay-offs face curbs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35507558,"The government is to look at more curbs on public sector redundancy payments as Chancellor George Osborne pledged to ""rein in"" sums paid to managers.A consultation will look at the case for limiting payoffs to three weeks salary per year of service and reducing the amount people are entitled to when they near retirement.The move follows a campaign by the Daily Mail against ""fat cat pay-offs"".Ministers have already pledged to cap individual payoffs at £95,000.The government says it wants to significantly reduce the cost to the taxpayer of public sector redundancy payments, which totalled about £6.5bn between 2011-12 and 2013-14.Freedom of Information requests by the Daily Mail and the Taxpayers' Alliance revealed that around 3,500 council employees across the UK earned more than £100,000 while one chief executive had an annual salary of almost £500,000.In new guidance, the government repeated that any public servant earning just over £140,000 - which is the amount the prime minister is paid - must have their salary authorised by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. But ministers also plan to press ahead with plans in the Conservative manifesto to cap redundancy payments at £95,000 and ban them when senior staff leave one public sector employer only to join another shortly afterwards. In a new consultation that will last three months, the government will look at the case for setting a standard formula for calculating what exit payments public sector mangers are entitled to, according to weeks worked or money earned over a certain period. Ministers also want to find out if there is support for preventing public sector employers offering their staff private health insurance and to taper the amount that executives can receive when they are approaching retirement.The Treasury said it wanted to the make exit compensation ""fairer, more modern and more consistent"".Mr Osborne told the Mail; ""Taxpayers foot the bill for the public sector and we've been determined that we take further action. We'll rein in unfair exit payments and issue new guidance across the public sector on the highest salaries.""The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said that as the squeeze on public sector budgets continues, ministers hope this plan can simultaneously save money and be popular. The £95,000 cap will apply, among other bodies, to the NHS, the police force, local authorities and schools. When the consultation was launched in August, the government said that the BBC, Channel 4, Bank of England, the Armed Forces, Royal Bank of Scotland and other taxpayer-owned banks would be among organisations exempt but ministers said they would expect such bodies to introduce ""their own, commensurate cap on exit payments"".Local authorities argue that retaining valued staff in senior roles doesn't come cheap. One council said it offered some employees private health cover ""to minimise absence from work due to sickness"". "
2016-02-06,UK brands Assange ruling 'ridiculous',https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35504237,"The UK foreign secretary has branded as ""ridiculous"" a UN panel's ruling that Julian Assange be allowed to go free, as the Wikileaks founder demanded the decision be respected.Mr Assange - who faces extradition to Sweden over a rape claim, which he denies - claimed asylum in London's Ecuadorean embassy in 2012.The panel said he had been ""arbitrarily detained"" and should get compensation.Philip Hammond rejected the decision, accusing Mr Assange of evading justice.Mr Assange hailed it as a ""significant victory"", but the UK government insisted the ruling was not legally binding and the report ""changes nothing"".The 44-year-old Australian was originally arrested in London in 2010 under a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden over rape and sexual assault allegations.Two years later, while on bail, he claimed asylum inside the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge. Reading a statement via a video link from the embassy, Mr Assange said the opinion of the panel was ""vindication"", adding: ""The lawfulness of my detention is now a matter of settled law.""He later addressed a crowd from a balcony at the Ecuadorean embassy, hailing the decision a ""victory of historical importance"". However, Mr Hammond said Mr Assange was a ""fugitive from justice"", adding that he can come out ""any time he chooses"" but will still have to face justice in Sweden. Anders Ronquist, legal chief at Sweden's foreign ministry, said Mr Assange ""is not being deprived of his liberty there due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities"". Elisabeth Massi Fritz, lawyer for the alleged rape victim, said the UN panel's decision was ""insulting and offensive"" to her client and was ""against all vulnerable victims' human rights"".Swedish prosecutors dropped an investigation into two sex assault claims against Mr Assange last year after running out of time to question him. However, he still faces the more serious accusation of rape.Mr Assange fears extradition to Sweden will lead to further extradition to the United States for questioning over the activities of Wikileaks, the website which has published secret documents and videos, including almost 400,000 US military logs.What next for Julian Assange?Who is Julian Assange?Julian Assange timelineHow unhealthy is living indoors?Mr Assange said the comments by Mr Hammond were ""beneath"" the minister's stature and ""insulting"" to the UN, while Ecuador's foreign minister criticised the UK for rejecting the panel's decision.Ricardo Patiño said the UK had violated ""important articles of the Universal Human Rights Convention and of the International Treaty on Political and Civil rights"".The whistleblower Edward Snowden, who is accused of espionage in the US and has received legal support from Wikileaks, tweeted that the UK and Sweden's response to the panel's decision ""writes a pass for every dictatorship to reject UN rulings"".   In September 2014, Mr Assange complained to the UN that he was being ""arbitrarily detained"" as he could not leave without being arrested.The complaint against the UK and Sweden claimed Mr Assange had been deprived of his liberty for an ""unacceptable length of time"".The UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention insisted Mr Assange's detention ""should be brought to an end, that his physical integrity and freedom of movement be respected"".The Wikileaks founder had been subjected to ""different forms of deprivation of liberty"" it said, initially while he was held in isolation at London's Wandsworth Prison for 10 days in 2010.The deprivation had been ""continuous"" since he was initially arrested in the UK on 7 December 2010.""Mr Assange should be afforded the right to compensation,"" it added.Three members of the five-person panel, which has made hundreds of rulings on whether imprisonment or detention is lawful since it was established in 1991, found in Mr Assange's favour.One rejected his claim and another did not take part in the investigation. The UK's permanent representative to the UN Julian Braithwaite has written to the panel expressing the government's surprise and disappointment with the outcome.Responding to criticism of the decision, Christophe Peschoux, from the UN, said: ""We can argue on the definition of detention or deprivation of liberty, but the fact is he's restricted against his will and his situation is one of detention since 2010 when he was first arrested."" He said the decision was not a ""ruling on the merits of the allegations that have been levelled against Mr Assange"" but he said the investigation was still in its ""preliminary stage"". ""And to the working group's knowledge the investigation has not proceeded and no charge has been filed,"" he added.  By Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondentJulian Assange and his supporters will see this as a significant moral victory.   The Wikileaks founder, who walked into the Ecuadorean Embassy after losing a series of appeals in British courts, now has an important panel of UN legal experts on his side.   Legally binding or not, a UN official said the decision was based on international law.   Although both Britain and Sweden are firmly sticking to their guns, they are now in an extremely awkward position.  The Swedish government has seized on the dissenting voice in the panel - who argued, as Britain does, that Mr Assange fled bail and was using the Ecuadorean embassy to evade arrest. The call for compensation for Mr Assange is particularly controversial when there is already public anger in the UK over the cost of policing his confinement at the embassy. "
2016-02-06,MP faces solicitor's harassment claim,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-35506120,"A married Conservative MP has been accused of harassing a former colleague when they worked at a London bank.Solicitor Patronia Campbell claims she shunned Huw Merriman's sexual advances 18 months after a one night stand, a tribunal heard.Ms Campbell alleges she was unfairly dismissed when she was made redundant from Lehman Brothers in 2014. Mr Merriman, MP for Bexhill and Battle and a former Lehman's Brothers manager, denies anything sexual happened.Ms Campbell is also bringing a case for harassment and victimisation against Mr Merriman, Lehman Brothers International and another managing director, Tim Parsons. The East London Employment Tribunal heard how one night in June 2011, Ms Campbell asked her friend, Simon Carter, if Mr Merriman could stay on his sofa.She was staying at Mr Carter's East London address while her home was renovated, the panel heard. In a statement, Mr Carter said: ""I met Mr Merriman briefly, offered him a glass of wine, chatted for a while then went to bed.""He said Ms Campbell and Mr Merriman were drunk and cooked something to eat. He said it was clear the two spent the night together and the next morning Mr Merriman emerged from the bathroom ""sheepishly"" in his pants.After he left, Mr Carter said Ms Campbell admitted he had stayed in her bed.The tribunal heard it was unlike Ms Campbell to have a ""casual fling"" but that she told Mr Carter she and Mr Merriman had a brief relationship some years back. Miss Campbell claims that 18 months later - at a work Christmas party in 2012 - Mr Merriman insinuated he wanted a sexual relationship.She claims she turned him down and that he began criticising and harassing her.Mr Merriman denies the one night stand but accepts he went to Mr Carter's house because he had missed the last train. The tribunal heard he claims ""nothing sexual transpired"" between him and Ms Campbell.The tribunal continues."

2016-02-06,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-06,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-06,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-06,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-06,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-06,Collectors' item?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35474095,"I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - ""Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008""); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect). And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. ""John 4 leader"", it says.I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.He's struck ""absolutely the right note"" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his ""rigidity"". Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is ""obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago"" and ""didn't want to listen, didn't want to change"".Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the ""prawn cocktail offensive"" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes. Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010. I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's ""easy to deal with"". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.      Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading ""a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us"".For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes: Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.So I'll put the ""John 4 leader"" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case."
2016-02-06,Albion Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35470281,"Britain could take the road that leads out of Europe - or, to be more precise, the EU - in just 139 days' time. If that is to happen, who will drive the decision? The answer highlights some significant divisions in British society.Prof John Curtice, pretty much the only poll watcher to emerge from the last election with his reputation enhanced, says that ""those who want to leave the European Union are demographically very distinctive - most distinctive of all are those who have relatively little in the way of educational qualifications"". The figures from the most recent British Social Attitudes survey in 2014 are stark. Just 35% of those who have no qualifications want to remain in the EU compared with 78% of those with university degrees. If you travel to Albion Street in the market town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, it's pretty clear why. To many of the people who work here, the EU looks like a club that doesn't much want them as members. It appears to be run by wealthy, well-educated men in suits for wealthy, well-educated men in suits. Julie McLeod, 46, who works at Brown & Wenman opticians, is typical of the sort of voter who could take us out of the EU. ""I'm a bit sceptical really of the whole Europe thing. I think they control too much of our laws,"" she told me. ""You want a situation where the British government can decide what the British government wants to do. We need a bit more say.""Julie, like many women voters, has not yet decided for certain how she'll vote. If Leave is to win, they need to convince many more people like her that the benefits of quitting outweigh the risks. Like so many others, immigration - and our government's inability to control it - is what bothers her most. Next door on Albion Street, shopkeeper Tim Smart spells out how he believes the recent influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has affected him, his family and his town. He complains that those who come here have an unfair advantage as not only do they speak their own languages but they go to English schools and learn to speak English as well. ""If they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position anywhere, who would you employ? Someone who speaks two languages or someone who speaks one language? My daughter has just had it in Northampton, funnily enough. It doesn't feel like a level playing field in my eyes.""Tim speaks for those who believe that immigration control is not simply a question of the country being too full, or of race or religion, but is a question of fairness.It is people like him who David Cameron has in mind when he talks of ending ""something for nothing"" by limiting the in-work benefits EU migrants can get. It was a proposal that emerged from intensive polling and countless focus groups, although so far he's had to water the idea down.Another sign that you may well be in favour of leaving the EU is your age. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to get out. It's an irony that the one group that have already had a vote on Europe - anyone aged 58 or older who could have voted when the last referendum was held in 1975 - are precisely the people who now want another chance to reverse the decision taken back then.The British Social Attitudes survey shows that almost half - 46% - of those over 55 want to get out while half that number - 23% - of those under 35 agree with them.Speaking to Kenneth Spinks, who's 85, you get a sense of why. He feels that he was invited to vote to join an economic club in which it was easier and cheaper to buy and sell things - the Common Market as it was known then - and has instead found himself governed by a big, bossy, bureaucratic organisation in Brussels.I spoke to him in the local Conservative Club. One more sign that you might be a Leaver is that you voted Conservative at the last election. Tory voters are much less likely to be pro-EU than those of other parties - other than UKIP, of course. That is why the draft deal David Cameron unveiled this week matters so much. Many Conservative voters - the people who backed the prime minister just last May - will be inclined to follow his lead just as Labour voters followed Harold Wilson's back in 1975. Kenneth couldn't have been clearer that he wants to quit Europe until we had this exchange.Me: ""You're a staunch Tory man, but even if the Tory leader says, 'I want us to stay in, I think it's in the best interest of the country,' you'd vote against him, would you?Kenneth: ""Well, it's all according to what he'll come back with. If he'll come back with something that's really good, it might sway me a bit.""Take a few more paces along Albion Street and you'll find the last crucial group of potential ""leavers"" - small businesspeople who, unlike those who run big companies, don't export to Europe but do still have to put up with its rules.Aaron Lee, 28, who runs Lee & Sons Cleaning Services, says:  ""All we're doing is paying out fortunes of money to join this trading union, and being told what we can and can't do. ""For example, we can only use a certain power Hoover because they've governed the power rating down. Where we could Hoover a floor in an hour, it's now going to take us two.""The Leave campaign cannot win simply by building a coalition of old, non graduate, self-employed voters. They will need - and, indeed, already have - support from younger, well-educated people who work for big businesses too. However, it is these divisions in society that could determine the future of our country for decades to come.The Today programme will be running a separate piece later on which voters are most likely to vote for the UK to remain in the EU."
2016-02-06,Will EU deal deliver?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35486520,"Cutting immigration, curbing benefits and returning powers from Brussels are among the key aims of David Cameron's EU reform deal, but will any of it work in practice?David Cameron fought hard to get a four year ban on new arrivals from other EU nations claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, which top up low wages.It will not be a blanket ban, as he had wanted, but will be graduated, so the longer migrants work in the UK, the more benefits they will become entitled to. The prime minister insists this will ""make a difference"" to high levels of immigration by reducing one of the main ""pull factors"" attracting people to the UK.But there is little direct evidence to suggest it will work.Sir Stephen Nickell, a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year he believed it was ""unlikely to have a huge impact"".The main ""pull factor"" for migrants is the availability of jobs, according to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, and campaign group Migration Watch.Benefits might prove to be an attraction to some, but most EU-born migrant workers are single or childless couples who do not claim a lot of tax credits, researchers say.Migration Watch said Mr Cameron's ""emergency brake"" on benefits would be ""unlikely to have any significant effect on levels of migration"".Some campaigners have suggested that increasing the amount of benefits people can receive each year will encourage them to remain in Britain.The in-work benefit ban was dreamed up by influential think tank Open Europe (its former boss Mats Persson is now Mr Cameron's chief adviser on EU reform).It argued in a November 2014 paper, that banning in-work benefits would mean take-home pay could drop below that which migrants would receive in their home states - they used Poland, Bulgaria and Spain as their examples - meaning that a move to the UK would no longer make financial sense.But the UK's plan to increase its minimum wage to £9 an hour for over-25s by 2020, which the government claims will remove the need to top-up wages with benefits, could undermine that argument.Also, it is not clear how checks would be made on how long people have actually been in the UK. Some regularly travel in and out of the UK or return to their home country to see family for a few months at a time.Asked whether Mr Cameron believed the proposed 'emergency brake' will cut immigration, a Downing Street spokesman said that migrant families were currently able to claim an average of £6,000 a year in tax credits and some 10,000 were claiming £10,000 or more.The UK spends about £30m a year on child benefit payments for children that do not live in the UK. About 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin.A majority of those payments go to children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.David Cameron wanted to change EU rules to end this, but instead he has been offered a deal under which child benefit will be paid in line with the wages in the country where the child is living.UK child benefit is £20.40 a week for the first child, about 5% of the average income. Under the proposed new rules, that might be reduced to £3.50 for a child living in Romania, where wages are low.But it might also mean the UK will pay higher levels of child benefit for than it currently does for children living in countries with higher average wages.There are also concerns that the Department for Work and Pensions will struggle to cope with calculating 28 different rates of child benefit, for each member state.Officials have also told the BBC they are unsure how they can be certain where the children of migrants are resident. David Cameron secured a clear legal statement that the UK was not committed to further political integration and that the phrase ""ever closer union"" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties. He also got new powers for national parliaments to band together to block unwanted EU laws - but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used. The ""red card"" procedure can only be triggered if at least 15 national Parliaments, representing 55% of the EU's population, agree.London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would be better if the UK was able to block EU laws on its own without having to rely on the support of other EU nations.In response to Mr Johnson's concerns, Mr Cameron revealed on Wednesday that he is planning to announced a measure that will put the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament ""beyond doubt"".Eurosceptic Tory MPs are pushing for a repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to assert that UK law has primacy over EU law. But critics say this would be tantamount to leaving the EU.Instead, the government is looking at ways of asserting parliamentary sovereignty that would question and challenge EU decisions but without causing constitutional chaos.There is speculation Mr Cameron will make some kind of unilateral declaration of sovereignty, at the same time as he concludes his negotiations over Britain's reformed relationship with the EU.And that he will use this to persuade Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU since this is an issue on which the mayor has campaigned for many months.Downing Street is refusing to give details of the proposals which are being worked on by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice. But Mr Cameron gave a hint last year in his November 10 Chatham House speech when he said ministers were looking at the way Germany used its constitutional court to test EU law.He said then: ""The Constitutional Court in Germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to Europe. And it also reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers, or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."""
2016-02-06,Facing facts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35482638,"""To be, or not to be together, that is the question which must be answered."" The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk reaches for his Shakespeare to stress the enormity of the decision before us. He doesn't spell out that Hamlet is pondering a big existential question - whether or not to kill himself, and so risk an eternity in hell. He may well think that leaving the EU is the global equivalent of being cut off from God's love in a fiery pit for all time. But the quote is not propitious. Hamlet of course, does not kill himself. But he and almost everyone else ends up dead, sprawled across the stage. I am sure it is an unintended irony that the only person left alive to survey the tragedy is young Fortinbras from Norway, a country that these days is outside the EU.There will enough words, wild and whirling, from me and others on the deal and the UK position. For now I want to look at the big picture of what the deal says about the state of the European Union itself and where it is heading. In tabloid speak ""How EU feeling?""After all the EU is in precarious crisis, its purpose and even existence in question, even without the threat of an important member leaving the club.The flood of migration has highlighted the EU's inability to reach swift decisions and its inability to implement them.  Like Hamlet it reflects, and dithers and debates rather than acts. But it makes the hesitant Prince of Denmark look like a ninja assassin. It has rendered the precious passport area ""more honoured in the breach than the observance"" to coin a phrase. It has narrowly avoided seeing a country chucked out of the Euro, leaving fundamental dangers and flaws behind the Greek crisis unsolved.  The Ukraine crisis raises huge questions about the EU's geographical limits and identity.  The need to have Turkey onside underscores them.In nearly every country we see the continued growth of parties which stress national self-interest over some common European destiny, and doubt the worth of the EU.For the first time in my life it is not hard to imagine the European Union slowly falling apart.Cheer or weep, that's huge, because no one knows what would follow.Read more:The danger for Mr Cameron is that while back at home some will claim he has won only a handful of worthless glass beads, other presidents and prime ministers may feel they have showered him with precious jewels.The deal may not be a pivotal point in the argument about the UK's membership but it is an interesting recognition of reality by the European Union itself, a bucket of cold water thrown over some of its aspirations. The French and Dutch ""no"" vote to the European constitution in 2005 were the high water mark of European federalism. These documents don't confirm that the political romantic dream of a super-national state is dead. They do suggest that it is lying down in a darkened room, not quite feeling itself.One important paragraph suggests that ""ever closer union"" is about a warm friendly feeling, not ""political integration"". Another acknowledges the Euro is not the only currency in operation, and two states need not join, and that their interests count too.The ""red card"" is vacuous, but a symbolic recognition that national Parliaments matter. There is a breach in the idea of equal treatment of workers, while arguing there isn't.There has been a lot of tosh talked over the years about a two-speed or two-tier Europe. In fact for ages the reality has been a multi-speed Europe, different countries joining in different parts of the project. There is a rather nice, pointed, passage in these documents where all the UK's opt-outs and exceptions are listed. There are six such protocols. If the EU has multiple orbits, Britain is Neptune, on the outer reaches of the solar system.This deal accepts that is fine.  It does not treat the UK's opt-outs as a perversion to be overcome by long and patient therapy, but a fact. It accepts the UK will continue to be a friend with benefits, and a white wedding isn't going to happen.  It doesn't encourage others to adopt the same position but it leaves the possibility open. If the UK leaves it will be an earth-shattering moment for the EU. The huge fundamental questions about its purpose will be asked afresh, with great angst. It will be diminished on the world stage, and be full of the forlorn questioning of the self-worth of the spurned lover. But if the UK stays, Mr Tusk's fundamental question remains. What is it the EU wants to be, if it is to be?At its heart is a paradox. Intellectually and rationally those who argue that the answer is more Europe have a point. More central authority, with a stronger common police and border force, and the ability to overrule individual countries would be one way out of the crisis. It just wouldn't be very palatable or democratic. Most economists, and indeed the British Government, acknowledge the Euro countries need deeper fiscal and economic integration. The trouble isn't merely that this goes right against the mood of the voters for less Europe. It goes against the mood of many national governments too - fed up being bossed, not by Brussels, but Berlin.It is very hard to see past this conundrum - Hamlet didn't only dither because of a fundamental flaw - but because all the available answers were the bad ones."
2016-02-06,Campaigner Cameron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207032739/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35476204,"It comprises 17 pages of closely argued legal jargon, diplomatic ambiguity and square brackets. The contents are dismissed by critics as a ""pint-sized package"" that fails to match the prime minister's lofty ambition of fundamental reform. It is a draft text that oozes with the obfuscation of old-style EU fudge. There are paragraphs of compromise that fail to meet the promises of the Conservative manifesto. The newspapers look down sniffily and ask: ""Is that it?"" Tory MPs mutter to one another in the corridors of Westminster, unable to hide their disappointment. One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of ""polishing a poo"". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders. And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain ""better off, more secure, more prosperous"". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the ""best of worlds"" and that was ""something worth fighting for"".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed. But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive. And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat. So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today. And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling. They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month. But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave. It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak. So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal. But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating. In other words, the referendum campaign has begun. "

They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels.

""Under such circumstances the incentive for anybody wishing to come to live in the UK will be to come as quickly as possible to beat the deadline when any such restrictions come into effect,"" he said.""Accordingly we are likely to see a surge in migrants in the next 12 months.""Mr Cameron has suggested the ""emergency brake"" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it.Eric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: ""What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union.""The reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining ""something for nothing"" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax.But Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: ""Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen.""Meanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU.The Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had ""never been an 'outer'"".Bernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: ""He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before.""Other potential Tory ""outers"" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal.Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a ""load of rubbish"" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it ""would be wonderful"" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it. He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences.He said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on ""identity and immigration,"" while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an ""optimistic, upbeat internationalist message"".A third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign.One of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO ""umbrella,"" and it was possible for them all to to operate as ""one happy family""."
2016-02-07,Tenants 'will be priced out of homes',https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35515993,"Many families in England could be forced out of their council homes and be unable to afford alternative housing in the same area, new research says.Subsidised rents for households earning more than £30,000, or £40,000 in London, will be scrapped in April 2017.Social housing tenants will be asked to pay rent at or near market rates.Ministers say it ""better reflects people's ability to pay"" - but Labour and the Local Government Association say it would hit hard-working families.The department for communities and local government argues that is ""not fair that hard-working people are subsidising the lifestyles of those on higher than average incomes, to the tune of £3,500 per year"". Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said people who could afford to pay more in rent ""should do so"" - but it would be graded, so that those on lower incomes would not have to pay full market rates.""We have always said we would consider carefully how much more people pay as they move through the pay scales, once they get over £30,000,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.He said the government would ""listen to what comes in before we make a final decision in the period ahead of us"".According to the LGA-commissioned study, almost 60,000 households in England will not be able to afford to pay rents at the market rate or take advantage of the right to buy.Councillor Peter Box, housing spokesman at the LGA, which represents hundreds of local councils in England, said: ""Many social housing tenants across the country will be unable to afford market rents or take up the offer to buy their council home under this policy.""A couple with three children, earning £15,000 each a year, cannot be defined as high income. Pay to stay needs to be voluntary for councils - as it will be for housing associations.""This flexibility is essential to allow us to protect social housing tenants and avoid the unintended consequence of hard-working families being penalised, people being disincentivised to work and earn more and key workers, such as nurses, teachers or social workers, having to move out of their local area.""The LGA figures, compiled by the estate agent Savills, show that almost 215,000 social housing tenants will be affected by the ""pay to stay"" policy.The policy is expected to save £245m a year by 2019-20, ending a situation where higher-income social tenants benefit from taxpayer-funded subsidies of up to £3,500 per year.Former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, now a crossbench peer, will attempt to amend the housing bill, which is being scrutinised next week in the House of Lords, to place the scheme at the discretion of local authorities.The peer, who is now chairman of the Peabody Trust housing association, has warned that the proposals were part of a package that could ""threaten the future of social housing"".He told The Observer: ""When this was originally discussed in the coalition government, it was intended to deal with the very small number of high earners on over £60,000. ""The current proposals will affect a lot more households with earnings of half that."" Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""This new research backs Labour's concerns that this Tory 'tenant tax' could force thousands of working families from their homes.""As the Housing and Planning Bill is debated in the House of Lords over the coming weeks, ministers should take a hard look at the effect their plans will have and use this opportunity to think again.""Are you affected by plans to raise social housing rents?

2016-02-07,Brittan abuse inquiry 'fully justified',https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35517197,"The Metropolitan Police investigation of a rape allegation against the late Lord Brittan was ""fully justified"", a review has concluded.Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but the report said the alleged victim's account was ""far from fanciful"".But the review - by Dorset Police - agreed the case was more ""likely to lead to acquittal than conviction"".Lord Brittan died last year unaware the inquiry against him had been dropped.The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that the former Conservative peer had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967, but the case was reopened less than a year later.Officers interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought.Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January 2015 aged 75.The review - carried out by Deputy Chief Constable James Vaughan from Dorset Police - found the case was examined by ""skilful and tenacious"" investigators. However, he did identify a number of weaknesses with the inquiry including the failure to tape an interview with Lord Brittan because recording equipment broke down.  By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny ShawThe Vaughan review's conclusions slipped on to the Home Affairs Committee website almost unnoticed - but with so much rumour and speculation about Scotland Yard and Operation Midland, the findings of an official report should demand our attention. Although the review identifies a series of errors with the rape inquiry, it broadly supports it.It contradicts the view of the detective first put in charge, Paul Settle, who told MPs he disagreed with the decision to reopen the case and that questioning Lord Brittan would have been a ""baseless witch hunt"".  The review says there were ""ample reasonable grounds"" for an interview and the inquiry couldn't have properly progressed without it.  Some critics will claim the review is meaningless because it's the ""police investigating the police"". But it shines a rare light on secretive investigative work. Its comment that the ""operational context"" the Met was working in was ""extraordinary"" and ""very stretched"" with numerous complex and high-profile cases is particularly telling.  It suggests that the strain of having to take on so many cases might affect their quality.  Amid continuing controversy about Operation Midland, the investigation into alleged abuse by high-profile figures, the Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz has revealed that Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has agreed to appear in front of MPs on 23 February. Scotland Yard has declined to comment on press reports that Sir Bernard is planning to apologise to Lord Brittan's widow and to Lord Bramall.  The former head of the Army was interviewed by police in connection with allegations of historical child abuse but was told last month no further action would be taken against him.In October, the Met published key findings from an internal report into the handling of the Lord Brittan case.It revealed investigating officers told the complainant in April that there would not have been a prosecution for rape had Lord Brittan still been alive.However, Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time as the complainant was. ""This would have permitted them to clarify the position with Lady Brittan, for which the MPS apologised in a letter to her solicitors on 6 October 2015,"" the report concluded.Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the Crown Prosecution Service had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.Labour MP Tom Watson, now the party's deputy leader, has been criticised for intervening in the case and refusing to apologise to the Brittan family for his outspoken claims.Mr Watson, a longstanding campaigner on exposing allegations of sexual abuse, wrote to Director for Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders in April 2014, calling for the case to be reviewed.However, the letter was only passed to the police on 2 June after Lord Brittan was questioned."
2016-02-07,Doctors' union irresponsible - Hunt,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35515732,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has accused the British Medical Association of being ""totally irresponsible"" over a lengthy industrial dispute. The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are ""unfair"".The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's ""shambolic mishandling"" of the matter.The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England.The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: ""One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. ""They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,"" he added.""We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.""BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had ""roundly rejected"".""Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,"" he said.""If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.""He went on to say the health secretary risked ""alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care"".Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said Mr Hunt was ""insulting the intelligence"" of junior doctors.""This is a group of people who are incredibly intelligent, are able to make their own minds up, have read the proposals for themselves and have followed the negotiations very carefully,"" she told Sky News.The junior doctors row explainedWhat exactly do junior doctors do?How does your job compare?"
2016-02-07,Jail 'rethink' over mothers with babies,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35515003,"David Cameron has called for an urgent rethink of the way the prison system in England and Wales treats pregnant women and mothers with babies.Ministry of Justice figures suggest 100 babies spent time living with their mothers in prisons last year.The prime minister said it was ""absolutely terrible"" to think of infants spending time behind bars.Labour said Mr Cameron had made promises on prisons before but they were still violent and overcrowded.Mr Cameron, who is due to give a speech on prisons policy on Monday, said:  ""There are actually women in these prisons who were born in the same prison 20 years earlier, and then have ended up there later as criminals themselves.""Think of the damage done to the life chances of these children.""At present, when a woman gives birth while serving a custodial sentence, she is usually transferred to a prison's mother-and-baby unit (MBU) for an initial period.MBU policy requires that these units should be available to accommodate babies up until the age of 18 months.Mr Cameron said: ""It's time to think seriously about whether this is the right approach.""We've got to break this cycle.""The review will look at whether female offenders with babies could be dealt with by special problem-solving courts, housed in resettlement units or electronically tagged, rather than being locked up.Downing Street said alternatives to custody would not be appropriate in every case and in some circumstances it could be in the best interests of the child for both mother and baby to be together in prison.The government also announced that a major pilot of satellite-tracking technology would launch later this year.The tagging system could be used to track the movement of non-violent offenders, potentially changing how prisoners are released on licence or the way community sentences are enforced.Labour's shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer said: ""With an estimated 200,000 children affected by parental imprisonment, many of whom are more likely to have mental health problems and to be involved in offending, it is right that we urgently look at the way the criminal justice system treats pregnant women and mothers with children.""It is also right that we should look at alternatives to custody for low-level offenders and, as Labour has long argued, we should also build on the success of the youth justice model to seek to divert more women away from the criminal justice system.""But we have heard many of David Cameron's promises before and it is worrying that the government is still burying its head in the sand when it comes to the state our prisons are in. ""Violent, overcrowded prisons will never be able to rehabilitate offenders and ministers must urgently address the crisis in our prisons.""Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ""There is huge sense in making sure that women pay back for what they have done in the community rather than suffer harsh separation from babies and toddlers in prison and the long-term damage that does."""

It's also what the retailers do, it's what schools do, it's what parents do,"" he said. Celebrity chef and campaigner, Jamie Oliver has been putting pressure on the government to introduce the tax and he wants the proceeds - which could amount to £1bn a year - to be invested in health promotion and schools.""Anyone you would trust your kids with is in support of this,"" he told Marr.""I don't mind not getting the tax, if there is something better and more symbolic because what we need is a change and a moment,"" he said.He asked the David Cameron to ""be brave and be bold"" and to ""hurry up""."

Like Powell, Lord Kinnock lost a campaign for a ""No"" vote 40 years ago.Powell also famously delivered the controversial ""Rivers of blood"" speech in 1968, attacking immigration - a move that cost him his front-bench job under Tory leader Edward Heath. Reflecting on the current EU referendum and 'Brexit' question, Lord Kinnock told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: ""I was really fearful of the pull of investment and jobs towards the centre of the then Common Market and away from areas like the one that I represented, Bedwellty at that time. ""What was evident - although I didn't realise it at the time - was at that very time the European Commission was working on the establishment of regional development funding and various priorities and activities that would counteract that pull of investment and jobs towards the centre.""As the years have passed it's become increasingly obvious, not only because of the regional development fund which obviously assists Wales substantially, but also because of investment decisions made more broadly that have made the UK the biggest receiver of international direct investment in all of the single market, bigger even than Germany. ""They are the two big changes politically and - vitally - economically that have taken place over the intervening years and radically and profoundly and I think irreversibly changed minds in Labour movement.""Lord Kinnock added: ""It doesn't apply to all Tories - far from it - but there is an activist element, a zealous element and ideological element almost that's pulled that party in the other direction.""Speaking about Prime Minister David Cameron's draft plan to reform the UK's membership of the EU, particularly around migration, Lord Kinnock said David Cameron was ""responsible for leading himself up this particularly dark alley"".""For instance, people don't generally know that there are no out of work benefits claimable as of right, by immigrants generally, including EU immigrants,"" he said.""So what we are talking about only, is in work benefits, that's to say tax credits and anything associated with being eligible to claim a supplement to your wage. ""But by definition of course, you have to be working before you can make such a claim, by getting the focus so explicitly on this, I think there is a danger that David Cameron has given himself such a bar, especially in terms of the Conservative manifesto, that was always going to be virtually impossible to clear.""The best he can do and I think he has probably achieved this, is arrangements which will ensure that the in-work benefits are abated substantially, without breaching laws of free movement. That's complex but doable."""

She has pledged to ensure Scotland Stronger in Europe makes a ""positive, factual, people-based"" case for the EU.The UK-wide campaigns to leave the EU have not yet set up Scottish operations.Scotland Stronger in Europe, which is the Scottish arm of Britain Stronger in Europe, will formally launch later this week.It will be headquartered in Glasgow, and has said its advisory group will be gender balanced and include people from both sides of the independence referendum debate. It will not contain any serving politicians, recognising the intentions of several parties to run their own campaigns.Prof Siddiqui said: ""The campaign to show that Scotland is better off in Europe will be positive, factual and people-based - making the case that our quality of life is better and horizons broader by keeping our place in the European Union. ""We will be working extremely hard to contribute to a UK-wide vote to stay in Europe, whenever the referendum is called.""Prof Siddiqui is a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, holds four honorary doctorates, and an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Scottish Architects for her contribution to public life. In 2011, she was awarded an OBE for her contribution to interfaith services. In 2015, she was named in the Debretts top 500 list of the most influential people in the UK. Scotland Stronger in Europe has previously named former SNP spin doctor Kevin Pringle as its communications head and former Motherwell and Wishaw Labour MP Frank Roy as its campaign director.And it has said John Edward, a former head of the European Parliament office in Scotland, will be its chief campaign spokesman.In Scotland, the SNP, Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Greens all back the UK remaining part of the EU, with only UKIP opposed.However, there are dissenting voices within the parties, with former Labour MP Nigel Griffiths heading a Scottish Labour Leave campaign and former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars saying he will campaign for the UK to leave the EU.Polls have suggested that Scottish voters are generally more in favour of remaining in the EU than those elsewhere in the UK.But UKIP leader Nigel Farage told BBC Scotland last week that it was a ""great myth that somehow Scotland's wonderfully in love with the European Union"" and claimed there had been ""precious little debate on this issue in Scotland"".Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017, and is reported to favour a poll on 23 June.However, the exact timing hinges on whether EU leaders agree at a summit next month to the draft package of reforms that was published last week.The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged Mr Cameron not to hold an EU referendum in June, saying it will ""distract"" from devolved elections taking place in May."

However, the associations' letter said: ""It was through the dedication and hard work of Conservative Party members that David Cameron secured the majority he needed to form a government...""It is deeply regrettable that the prime minister dismisses the very people who helped secure his victory, and he should remember that no prime minister has a divine right to rule.""In the letter they urged Mr Cameron to ""accept that loyal Conservative Party members want the opportunity for a balanced debate"".Among the signatories are Ed Costelloe, chairman of Grassroots Conservatives, Matt Ewert of the South Staffordshire Conservative Association, Tony Partridge of the Clwyd South Conservative Association and Geoffrey Vero of the Surrey Heath Conservative Constituency Association.Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said local Tory associations ""care passionately about their local ability to make decisions"" but the PM had stressed everyone would have their say at the referendum.The letter comes amid continued speculation about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU when Mr Cameron announces the date of the referendum.Home Secretary Theresa May is thought to have ruled herself out, and Mr Cameron is hoping to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to back him.A spokesman for Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he ""supports the prime minister's strategy to renegotiate our relationship with the European Union"" and it would be ""premature"" to make a judgement before the deal is concluded.A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he would ""make his views known when he's seen the final deal"".A spokesman for Employment Minister Priti Patel, who has been at the centre of press speculation that she will lead the exit campaign, said she had ""always said she would make a judgement once we've seen the final deal"".UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it ""would be wonderful"" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it needs and welcomes anyone who wants to join it.

2016-02-07,MPs challenge 'unclear' bank tax rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35515720,"Chancellor George Osborne has been asked to clarify whether banks are offsetting the cost of fines they pay against tax to cut their tax bill.Treasury Select Committee MPs raised concerns that banks fined millions for wrongdoing may be exploiting loopholes and ""unclear"" rules to pay less tax.It is important taxpayers do not ""bear the burden"", committee chairman Andrew Tyrie told the chancellor in a letter.The Treasury said it would respond to the letter in due course.Under UK law, banks are not allowed to log fines they are forced to pay for mis-selling and other misconduct as a cost in order to reduce their profits and, in turn, the amount of tax they pay.There are also tight restrictions about off setting compensation payments to customers against tax.However, Mr Tyrie said it appeared in some circumstances banks were able to claim fines they paid to the regulator were tax deductable.He called on Mr Osborne to confirm this was not allowed, as there appeared to be ""some doubt"" about the rules.By Joe Lynam, business correspondentIn the early 1990s some firms had been deducting from their tax bill - i.e. treating as a legitimate expense - protection money paid to the Provisional IRA. The then Prime Minister John Major intervened and banned the practice.  But there still remains no clarity on the issues of what can and cannot be deducted. HMRC has issued guidance on the matter but, as you can see, the section under fines imposed by regulators still says (words to the effect of) on the one hand you can but on the other you cannot.  Even for tax experts, the question of whether mis-selling or fines imposed by the government or independent watchdogs can be considered a legitimate cost of business is unclear.The Chartered Institute of Taxation has called for clarity from the government, which is exactly what the Treasury Select Committee also hopes to get in its letter to the chancellor today.Mr Tyrie said it was ""not just appropriate, but essential"" that fines were not tax deductable. ""It is important that taxpayers are not required to to bear any part of the burden of any payment import by the FCA or overseas regulators. The bill should be picked up by the bank's shoulders.""If banks were ""not happy about it"", they had a number of possible remedies, including controlling employees salaries and bonuses, he said.He also raised concerns that settlements reached with foreign governments were sometimes structured in a way that allowed payment to be offset against British tax.He did not know whether this suggestion was well-founded, but if it was true it would be ""alarming"", he said. In recent years, banks including HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Clydesdale Bank have been fined by the FCA over misconduct."
2016-02-07,Councils should run services - Corbyn,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35508740,"Councils should be able to run utilities in their areas as part of moves to ""roll back the tide"" of privatisation, Jeremy Corbyn has said.Privatisation of services has made them less accountable, the Labour leader told a conference in Nottingham.He said English councils should have similar powers to cities on the continent, where local authorities have control of water and energy services.A Conservative spokesman said such a move would ""hurt working people"".Mr Corbyn's support for public ownership and anti-austerity message are at the centre of Labour's campaign for May's local elections in England. He told the Association of Labour Councillors conference he wants councils to become ""public entrepreneurs"" with greater freedom to spend taxpayers' money and to borrow to fund investment and public services.Mr Corbyn, who has already set out plans to take the railways back into public ownership, said he would back local authorities to take control of utilities and other services in their area.""Privatisation isn't just about who runs a service, it's about who services are accountable to,"" he said. ""It's about who shares the rewards, about protecting the workforce and getting a good deal for local people who use the services.""After a generation of forced privatisation and outsourcing of public services, the evidence has built up that handing services over to private companies routinely delivers poorer quality, higher cost, worse terms and conditions for the workforce, less transparency and less say for the public.""We will give councils greater freedoms to roll back the tide of forced privatisation. ""It locks people out of decision-making, makes services less accountable, too often means a bad deal for taxpayers, a bad deal for communities and a bad deal for those that work in the services too.""A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is another example of how the Labour Party will hurt working people by racking up more debt and increasing taxes to pay for it - driving up the cost of living for working families.""That's why Labour are a threat to our economic security and every working family's security. The Conservatives will continue to deliver stability, security and opportunity for working people.""Mr Corbyn also said that remaining in the European Union was in the best interests of the British people. However, he said he wants to see further reforms in Brussels, including stronger workers' rights and an end to the pressure to privatise public services.The speech comes as it emerged a Muslim women's group has written to Mr Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into ""systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors"".Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats."
2016-02-07,New rules 'will silence' charities,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35509117,"Charities have said new rules on how they spend government grants amount to making them take a vow of silence.From May, charities and organisations will no longer be allowed to spend taxpayers' money on lobbying ministers.The Cabinet Office said the new clause in grants would mean funds go to good causes, not political campaigns.Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said it was an ""insane policy"" that would not work in reality.""Take a service charity funded to run a helpline. They may well be dealing with ex-servicemen, there will be policy issues that emerge from that. They're not allowed to tell the government?"" he told the BBC.""The other reason is, if you've got mixed funding, how are you going to know which is the government's and somebody else's?""The ""draconian"" move  was ""tantamount to making charities take a vow of silence"", he added. Under the new conditions , which only apply to grants from central UK government departments, organisations will not be able to use grants for ""activity intended to influence - or attempt to influence - Parliament, government or political parties"". However charities will still be able to use privately-raised funds to campaign as they like. Christopher Snowden, from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a right-of-centre think tank, agrees with the changes.""It's not about silencing charities, it's not about stopping charities - whether they get public money or not -  from speaking out, of course they should do, it's very important that they campaign and lobby for the things that are important to them,"" he told the BBC.""It's specifically about the money that they get from government and how that is spent.""Cabinet Office Minister Matthew Hancock said: ""Taxpayers' money must be spent on improving people's lives and spreading opportunities, not wasted on the farce of government lobbying government.""These common sense rules will protect freedom of speech - but taxpayers won't be made to foot the bill for political campaigning and political lobbying.However, Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons Health Select Committee, posted on Twitter: ""Ending charities ability to lobby ministers wld have serious consequences for #publichealth Balance already distorted in favour of industry.""According to a House of Commons briefing, the estimated total income of the UK voluntary sector (not including charities) in 2012-13 was £40bn, of which £13bn came from government grants.The Cabinet Office said UK government departments gave the voluntary sector just under £10bn in grants last year. BBC political reporter Alan Soady said exactly how the new rules would be enforced - and how charities would prove which pots of money funding for lobbying came from - was still unanswered.There was also some concern in Whitehall that some charities seemed to have been set up primarily to lobby, or that they were straying from their brief on the issues they lobbied on, he said.The move follows research by the IEA into so-called ""sock puppets"", where taxpayers' money is given to pressure groups which then campaign for policy changes or extra money.Former Bishop of Oxford Lord Harries, who chairs a commission which has looked into charity lobbying - the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement - said the ""polarisation"" between charities' direct work and policies they wanted to change was ""very, very unhelpful"".Charities on the ""front line"" could often best identify where government policy was failing, and ""surely they are morally bound to tell the government they could improve their work to help, say, children in poverty?"" he said.The system has been trialled in grants provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ministers insisted it had not curtailed the ability of charities such as Shelter from lobbying on housing legislation.

2016-02-07,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-07,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-07,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-07,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:Most of the objections have been over the idea of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU has been that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals. European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.It includes a form of an ""emergency brake"" which would allow the UK to apply to restrict EU migrants' benefits for four years if the UK votes to remain in the Union.There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations. Read more: Cameron unveils draft reform proposalsNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the groups that are making the early running:Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it is vying for official designation with Vote Leave.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-07,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-07,Collectors' item?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35474095,"I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - ""Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008""); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect). And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. ""John 4 leader"", it says.I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.He's struck ""absolutely the right note"" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his ""rigidity"". Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is ""obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago"" and ""didn't want to listen, didn't want to change"".Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the ""prawn cocktail offensive"" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes. Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010. I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's ""easy to deal with"". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.      Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading ""a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us"".For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes: Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.So I'll put the ""John 4 leader"" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case."
2016-02-07,Albion Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35470281,"Britain could take the road that leads out of Europe - or, to be more precise, the EU - in just 139 days' time. If that is to happen, who will drive the decision? The answer highlights some significant divisions in British society.Prof John Curtice, pretty much the only poll watcher to emerge from the last election with his reputation enhanced, says that ""those who want to leave the European Union are demographically very distinctive - most distinctive of all are those who have relatively little in the way of educational qualifications"". The figures from the most recent British Social Attitudes survey in 2014 are stark. Just 35% of those who have no qualifications want to remain in the EU compared with 78% of those with university degrees. If you travel to Albion Street in the market town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, it's pretty clear why. To many of the people who work here, the EU looks like a club that doesn't much want them as members. It appears to be run by wealthy, well-educated men in suits for wealthy, well-educated men in suits. Julie McLeod, 46, who works at Brown & Wenman opticians, is typical of the sort of voter who could take us out of the EU. ""I'm a bit sceptical really of the whole Europe thing. I think they control too much of our laws,"" she told me. ""You want a situation where the British government can decide what the British government wants to do. We need a bit more say.""Julie, like many women voters, has not yet decided for certain how she'll vote. If Leave is to win, they need to convince many more people like her that the benefits of quitting outweigh the risks. Like so many others, immigration - and our government's inability to control it - is what bothers her most. Next door on Albion Street, shopkeeper Tim Smart spells out how he believes the recent influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has affected him, his family and his town. He complains that those who come here have an unfair advantage as not only do they speak their own languages but they go to English schools and learn to speak English as well. ""If they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position anywhere, who would you employ? Someone who speaks two languages or someone who speaks one language? My daughter has just had it in Northampton, funnily enough. It doesn't feel like a level playing field in my eyes.""Tim speaks for those who believe that immigration control is not simply a question of the country being too full, or of race or religion, but is a question of fairness.It is people like him who David Cameron has in mind when he talks of ending ""something for nothing"" by limiting the in-work benefits EU migrants can get. It was a proposal that emerged from intensive polling and countless focus groups, although so far he's had to water the idea down.Another sign that you may well be in favour of leaving the EU is your age. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to get out. It's an irony that the one group that have already had a vote on Europe - anyone aged 58 or older who could have voted when the last referendum was held in 1975 - are precisely the people who now want another chance to reverse the decision taken back then.The British Social Attitudes survey shows that almost half - 46% - of those over 55 want to get out while half that number - 23% - of those under 35 agree with them.Speaking to Kenneth Spinks, who's 85, you get a sense of why. He feels that he was invited to vote to join an economic club in which it was easier and cheaper to buy and sell things - the Common Market as it was known then - and has instead found himself governed by a big, bossy, bureaucratic organisation in Brussels.I spoke to him in the local Conservative Club. One more sign that you might be a Leaver is that you voted Conservative at the last election. Tory voters are much less likely to be pro-EU than those of other parties - other than UKIP, of course. That is why the draft deal David Cameron unveiled this week matters so much. Many Conservative voters - the people who backed the prime minister just last May - will be inclined to follow his lead just as Labour voters followed Harold Wilson's back in 1975. Kenneth couldn't have been clearer that he wants to quit Europe until we had this exchange.Me: ""You're a staunch Tory man, but even if the Tory leader says, 'I want us to stay in, I think it's in the best interest of the country,' you'd vote against him, would you?Kenneth: ""Well, it's all according to what he'll come back with. If he'll come back with something that's really good, it might sway me a bit.""Take a few more paces along Albion Street and you'll find the last crucial group of potential ""leavers"" - small businesspeople who, unlike those who run big companies, don't export to Europe but do still have to put up with its rules.Aaron Lee, 28, who runs Lee & Sons Cleaning Services, says:  ""All we're doing is paying out fortunes of money to join this trading union, and being told what we can and can't do. ""For example, we can only use a certain power Hoover because they've governed the power rating down. Where we could Hoover a floor in an hour, it's now going to take us two.""The Leave campaign cannot win simply by building a coalition of old, non graduate, self-employed voters. They will need - and, indeed, already have - support from younger, well-educated people who work for big businesses too. However, it is these divisions in society that could determine the future of our country for decades to come.The Today programme will be running a separate piece later on which voters are most likely to vote for the UK to remain in the EU."
2016-02-07,Will EU deal deliver?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35486520,"Cutting immigration, curbing benefits and returning powers from Brussels are among the key aims of David Cameron's EU reform deal, but will any of it work in practice?David Cameron fought hard to get a four year ban on new arrivals from other EU nations claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, which top up low wages.It will not be a blanket ban, as he had wanted, but will be graduated, so the longer migrants work in the UK, the more benefits they will become entitled to. The prime minister insists this will ""make a difference"" to high levels of immigration by reducing one of the main ""pull factors"" attracting people to the UK.But there is little direct evidence to suggest it will work.Sir Stephen Nickell, a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year he believed it was ""unlikely to have a huge impact"".The main ""pull factor"" for migrants is the availability of jobs, according to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, and campaign group Migration Watch.Benefits might prove to be an attraction to some, but most EU-born migrant workers are single or childless couples who do not claim a lot of tax credits, researchers say.Migration Watch said Mr Cameron's ""emergency brake"" on benefits would be ""unlikely to have any significant effect on levels of migration"".Some campaigners have suggested that increasing the amount of benefits people can receive each year will encourage them to remain in Britain.The in-work benefit ban was dreamed up by influential think tank Open Europe (its former boss Mats Persson is now Mr Cameron's chief adviser on EU reform).It argued in a November 2014 paper, that banning in-work benefits would mean take-home pay could drop below that which migrants would receive in their home states - they used Poland, Bulgaria and Spain as their examples - meaning that a move to the UK would no longer make financial sense.But the UK's plan to increase its minimum wage to £9 an hour for over-25s by 2020, which the government claims will remove the need to top-up wages with benefits, could undermine that argument.Also, it is not clear how checks would be made on how long people have actually been in the UK. Some regularly travel in and out of the UK or return to their home country to see family for a few months at a time.Asked whether Mr Cameron believed the proposed 'emergency brake' will cut immigration, a Downing Street spokesman said that migrant families were currently able to claim an average of £6,000 a year in tax credits and some 10,000 were claiming £10,000 or more.The UK spends about £30m a year on child benefit payments for children that do not live in the UK. About 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin.A majority of those payments go to children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.David Cameron wanted to change EU rules to end this, but instead he has been offered a deal under which child benefit will be paid in line with the wages in the country where the child is living.UK child benefit is £20.40 a week for the first child, about 5% of the average income. Under the proposed new rules, that might be reduced to £3.50 for a child living in Romania, where wages are low.But it might also mean the UK will pay higher levels of child benefit for than it currently does for children living in countries with higher average wages.There are also concerns that the Department for Work and Pensions will struggle to cope with calculating 28 different rates of child benefit, for each member state.Officials have also told the BBC they are unsure how they can be certain where the children of migrants are resident. David Cameron secured a clear legal statement that the UK was not committed to further political integration and that the phrase ""ever closer union"" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties. He also got new powers for national parliaments to band together to block unwanted EU laws - but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used. The ""red card"" procedure can only be triggered if at least 15 national Parliaments, representing 55% of the EU's population, agree.London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would be better if the UK was able to block EU laws on its own without having to rely on the support of other EU nations.In response to Mr Johnson's concerns, Mr Cameron revealed on Wednesday that he is planning to announced a measure that will put the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament ""beyond doubt"".Eurosceptic Tory MPs are pushing for a repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to assert that UK law has primacy over EU law. But critics say this would be tantamount to leaving the EU.Instead, the government is looking at ways of asserting parliamentary sovereignty that would question and challenge EU decisions but without causing constitutional chaos.There is speculation Mr Cameron will make some kind of unilateral declaration of sovereignty, at the same time as he concludes his negotiations over Britain's reformed relationship with the EU.And that he will use this to persuade Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU since this is an issue on which the mayor has campaigned for many months.Downing Street is refusing to give details of the proposals which are being worked on by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice. But Mr Cameron gave a hint last year in his November 10 Chatham House speech when he said ministers were looking at the way Germany used its constitutional court to test EU law.He said then: ""The Constitutional Court in Germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to Europe. And it also reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers, or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."""
2016-02-07,Facing facts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35482638,"""To be, or not to be together, that is the question which must be answered."" The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk reaches for his Shakespeare to stress the enormity of the decision before us. He doesn't spell out that Hamlet is pondering a big existential question - whether or not to kill himself, and so risk an eternity in hell. He may well think that leaving the EU is the global equivalent of being cut off from God's love in a fiery pit for all time. But the quote is not propitious. Hamlet of course, does not kill himself. But he and almost everyone else ends up dead, sprawled across the stage. I am sure it is an unintended irony that the only person left alive to survey the tragedy is young Fortinbras from Norway, a country that these days is outside the EU.There will enough words, wild and whirling, from me and others on the deal and the UK position. For now I want to look at the big picture of what the deal says about the state of the European Union itself and where it is heading. In tabloid speak ""How EU feeling?""After all the EU is in precarious crisis, its purpose and even existence in question, even without the threat of an important member leaving the club.The flood of migration has highlighted the EU's inability to reach swift decisions and its inability to implement them.  Like Hamlet it reflects, and dithers and debates rather than acts. But it makes the hesitant Prince of Denmark look like a ninja assassin. It has rendered the precious passport area ""more honoured in the breach than the observance"" to coin a phrase. It has narrowly avoided seeing a country chucked out of the Euro, leaving fundamental dangers and flaws behind the Greek crisis unsolved.  The Ukraine crisis raises huge questions about the EU's geographical limits and identity.  The need to have Turkey onside underscores them.In nearly every country we see the continued growth of parties which stress national self-interest over some common European destiny, and doubt the worth of the EU.For the first time in my life it is not hard to imagine the European Union slowly falling apart.Cheer or weep, that's huge, because no one knows what would follow.Read more:The danger for Mr Cameron is that while back at home some will claim he has won only a handful of worthless glass beads, other presidents and prime ministers may feel they have showered him with precious jewels.The deal may not be a pivotal point in the argument about the UK's membership but it is an interesting recognition of reality by the European Union itself, a bucket of cold water thrown over some of its aspirations. The French and Dutch ""no"" vote to the European constitution in 2005 were the high water mark of European federalism. These documents don't confirm that the political romantic dream of a super-national state is dead. They do suggest that it is lying down in a darkened room, not quite feeling itself.One important paragraph suggests that ""ever closer union"" is about a warm friendly feeling, not ""political integration"". Another acknowledges the Euro is not the only currency in operation, and two states need not join, and that their interests count too.The ""red card"" is vacuous, but a symbolic recognition that national Parliaments matter. There is a breach in the idea of equal treatment of workers, while arguing there isn't.There has been a lot of tosh talked over the years about a two-speed or two-tier Europe. In fact for ages the reality has been a multi-speed Europe, different countries joining in different parts of the project. There is a rather nice, pointed, passage in these documents where all the UK's opt-outs and exceptions are listed. There are six such protocols. If the EU has multiple orbits, Britain is Neptune, on the outer reaches of the solar system.This deal accepts that is fine.  It does not treat the UK's opt-outs as a perversion to be overcome by long and patient therapy, but a fact. It accepts the UK will continue to be a friend with benefits, and a white wedding isn't going to happen.  It doesn't encourage others to adopt the same position but it leaves the possibility open. If the UK leaves it will be an earth-shattering moment for the EU. The huge fundamental questions about its purpose will be asked afresh, with great angst. It will be diminished on the world stage, and be full of the forlorn questioning of the self-worth of the spurned lover. But if the UK stays, Mr Tusk's fundamental question remains. What is it the EU wants to be, if it is to be?At its heart is a paradox. Intellectually and rationally those who argue that the answer is more Europe have a point. More central authority, with a stronger common police and border force, and the ability to overrule individual countries would be one way out of the crisis. It just wouldn't be very palatable or democratic. Most economists, and indeed the British Government, acknowledge the Euro countries need deeper fiscal and economic integration. The trouble isn't merely that this goes right against the mood of the voters for less Europe. It goes against the mood of many national governments too - fed up being bossed, not by Brussels, but Berlin.It is very hard to see past this conundrum - Hamlet didn't only dither because of a fundamental flaw - but because all the available answers were the bad ones."
2016-02-07,Campaigner Cameron,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35476204,"It comprises 17 pages of closely argued legal jargon, diplomatic ambiguity and square brackets. The contents are dismissed by critics as a ""pint-sized package"" that fails to match the prime minister's lofty ambition of fundamental reform. It is a draft text that oozes with the obfuscation of old-style EU fudge. There are paragraphs of compromise that fail to meet the promises of the Conservative manifesto. The newspapers look down sniffily and ask: ""Is that it?"" Tory MPs mutter to one another in the corridors of Westminster, unable to hide their disappointment. One is so affronted he stands up in the House of Commons and accuses his government of ""polishing a poo"". Such is the elevation of political discourse that the European Union engenders. And yet David Cameron is on his feet at a factory in Wiltshire claiming the draft reform deal published by Donald Tusk would leave Britain ""better off, more secure, more prosperous"". The settlement, the prime minister said, gave Britain the ""best of worlds"" and that was ""something worth fighting for"".So yes, Mr Cameron may have to spend the next two weeks twisting arms in Europe, there may be no guarantee of a deal and everyone is agreed that nothing is agreed until everything agreed. But the prime minister is already in campaign mode, bouncing around tiggerishly in his shirtsleeves, selling his deal almost as if it had been agreed. There will be an emergency brake on in-work benefits imposed on EU migrants, they will be able to send less child benefit home, there will be greater protection for businesses from the Eurozone, parliaments will get more powers to block EU laws, the UK will escape further political integration within the EU, there are legally binding promises to make the EU more competitive. And there will be changes to make it easier for the UK to exclude terror suspects even if there is no imminent threat. So here's the point. However much this package is diluted or changed in coming weeks, Mr Cameron now believes he will have enough of a deal to sell to the British people. And that means that he can begin to make his case for Britain to remain within the EU from today. And that will have consequences. Tory ministers who want to support the campaign to leave the EU are champing at the bit, silenced by collective responsibility while the prime minister gets his campaign rolling. They will be released from their omerta once the cabinet has agreed the government's official position after the summit later this month. But that means the PM has a clear couple of weeks where he can own the political space - as long as his ministers behave. It also illustrates Mr Cameron's impatience for a quick referendum in June while his opponents are divided and before refugee numbers have reached their summer peak. So Mr Cameron insists that what he wants is the right deal not a quick deal. But today he gave every impression of being a man in a hurry, keen to start campaigning even while he's still negotiating. In other words, the referendum campaign has begun. "
2016-02-07,EU leaders on board?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160207180556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35469933,"My first instinct is that this is something everyone can work with.Eastern and Central European countries will continue to complain about the suspension of migrant in-work benefits.They are likely to argue that the EU has sold its principles down the river in an attempt to keep the UK in the EU. They have to be seen by their own voters as protecting the right to live and work in any other member state. That's a founding principle of the European Union.  However, it can be argued from this text that the so-called ""emergency brake"" is not discriminatory because it's available for any country to use.UK-EU draft deal - Latest updatesWhat you need to knowOther elements of the section on migrant benefits, such as child allowances and sham marriages, are unlikely to raise many eyebrows. All 28 member states want to clamp down on any potential abuse of the welfare system.The French will be delighted there is no proposal for a UK veto over eurozone legislation.  But the UK does get to pull a different brake, this time on eurozone legislation that it fears may be detrimental to non-eurozone countries. In practice, the UK government is particularly concerned with protecting the City of London.According to the draft deal, eurozone members must ""respect the competencies, rights and obligations of member states whose currency is not the euro"". It allows the UK to call a summit of EU leaders if it is deeply concerned.The ""red card"" system trumpeted by Number 10, which would enable a majority of national parliaments to club together to object to or veto European Commission proposals, is unlikely to prove contentious.  It appears to be a beefing up of the little-used ""yellow card"" system whereby national parliaments can raise concern if they believe an issue could better be dealt with at home rather than in Brussels. However the government will hope it will sound good in terms of wrestling back powers from Brussels to the UK - and to other EU countries.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumReferendum timeline: What will happen when?Q&A: What does Britain want from Europe?More: BBC News EU referendum special"

2016-02-08,PM denies scaremongering over 'Jungle',https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35519210,"David Cameron has rejected the idea he is ""scaremongering"" by claiming migrant camps like the ""Jungle"" in Calais could move to England if the UK left the EU.The PM said a vote to leave would give French politicians the chance to ""tear up"" the deal which lets UK border guards check passports at Calais.Campaigners for the UK to leave the EU say the deal is between the two countries and not an EU deal.UKIP said the PM's claim was ""based on fear, negativity and falsehood"".The 13-year agreement with France had ""nothing to do with our EU membership,"" said Vote Leave, while Leave.EU said there was ""no reason for this to change on leaving the EU"". Mr Cameron's former defence secretary Liam Fox said he was ""sad and disappointed to see our prime minister stoop to this level of scaremongering"", while fellow Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said Mr Cameron was ""taking voters for fools"".An in-out referendum on EU membership has been promised by the end of 2017, although it is widely expected to be at the end of June, if Mr Cameron can secure agreement to his reform proposals at the next summit of EU leaders on 18 February.About 5,000 migrants and refugees trying to reach the UK are thought to live at the ""Jungle"" camp in Calais.Under the terms of the February 2003 Le Touquet treaty between the UK and France, checks for migrants trying to illegally stow away on lorries or trains heading for Britain are carried out by British border guards at a number of French ports. Under the system of ""juxtaposed controls"", which was transposed into UK law in June 2003, the UK operates immigration checkpoints in Calais and Dunkirk, while France has a checkpoint at Dover. Analysis: By BBC assistant political editor Norman SmithAsked about the suggestion that he was ""scaremongering"" by linking a vote to leave the EU with the moving of the Calais migrant camps to the south coast of England, Mr Cameron said it was a very real risk.""There are any number of opposition politicians in France who would love to tear up the excellent agreement we have with France to make sure that we have our borders on their side of the Channel - I don't think we should give those politicians any excuse to do that,"" he said.""If we can get this deal in Europe, if we can get this renegotiation fixed and we can stay in a reformed Europe, you know what you get. You know the borders stay in Calais.""The deputy Mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, bolstered his case by telling the BBC: ""We will have to cancel these agreements, because England won't be in Europe anymore. So that will really be a foreign country for us.""But the UK's former chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, told the BBC's World at One he didn't think the UK's exit from the EU would lead to an immediate collapse in cross border arrangements with France.""I don't necessarily think this would collapse overnight. If it didn't exist there would still be border controls. We would have to rely on the Belgians and the French,"" he said. Mr Vine pointed out asylum seekers could only claim asylum once they were on British soil. The 'Treaty of Le Touquet' is an agreement between France and the UK that has been in place since 2003 and governs border control arrangements and immigration. The treaty ensures that immigration checks are carried out before passengers embark on cross channel services - French Border Police have immigration checkpoints at Dover while  the UK has immigration checkpoints at Calais and Dunkirk. But at Calais and Dunkirk, passengers also go through French exit checks, as well as UK immigration entry checks.In theory this stops those seeking to reach the UK from doing so without their immigration status being checked first. But this has also led to the establishment of camps in Calais such as the so-called Jungle and previously, Sangatte.The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Cameron's warning was a sign that Downing Street was planning to emphasise what it sees as the important contribution the EU makes to the country's national security.But Vote Leave said Mr Cameron's claims had no basis in reality. ""UK border controls are in France because of a bilateral treaty, not because of our EU membership, and a result of the camps in Calais, not the cause of them,"" said Matthew Elliott, the campaign group's chief executive.""Clearly, No 10 is in a blind panic over the failing renegotiation.""Leave.EU co-founder, Arron Banks said: ""The agreement we have to process migrants in Calais is with France, not the EU. There is no reason for this to change on Leaving the EU.""The key issue here is that we should not have to accept migrants that have arrived from a safe country. The scandal of countries effectively waving migrants through Western Europe to our shores will only end when we are able to control our borders again.""Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum specialMr Cameron has been touring European capitals trying to build support for his draft renegotiation package, which he has said is the basis for a new settlement for Britain in the EU but which has been dismissed as inconsequential by those wanting to leave the EU.Mayor of London Boris Johnson, a key figure in the Conservative Party, has said the case for staying or leaving is ""finely balanced"" and he would only decide which way to campaign when the terms of the final agreement were known.""This is the moment to stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, squint down the barrel and only when you see the whites of their eyes should you finally let fly and decide whether to stay or leave the EU,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

2016-02-08,Pilot in prisons seeks to cut violence,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35518477,"Six ""reform prisons"" are to be created in England and Wales as part of a pilot to tackle high levels of violence and re-offending, David Cameron has said.The governors would have autonomy over their operation and budgets, he said.The PM also announced new powers to speed up the deportation of foreign inmates and plans for all jails to be assessed through league tables.Penal charities said reforms would not work if prisoners were ""crammed into filthy institutions with no staff"".Downing Street said the creation of the ""reform prisons"" from existing jails would happen by the end of the year, although it did not name any locations.Mr Cameron said ""current levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm should shame us all"", with a typical week seeing 600 incidents of self-harm, at least one suicide and 350 assaults including 90 on staff.In what he described as the ""biggest shake-up of prisons since the Victorian era"", he said prisoners should be seen as ""potential assets to be harnessed"" and the ""failure of our system today is scandalous"".In other developments:Ahead of his speech to the Policy Exchange think tank in central London, Mr Cameron was shown around HMP Onley, a category C prison near Rugby, where he met prisoners being trained in bicycle repair and barista skills.Mr Cameron said the government would accept the recommendations made in Dame Sally Coates's review of prison education, due to be published soon, including a promise to protect the £130m budget. 85,641prisoners147prisoners per 100,000 population14,247 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults 595 serious assaults on staff 89 self-inflicted deaths 32% of offenders with one previous custodial sentence re-offend Former Liberal Democrat MP and education minister David Laws will help develop a new scheme through organisations such as TeachFirst to encourage graduates to take up teaching posts in prisons.BBC home editor Mark Easton says the government will try to square the circle of pushing up standards without pushing up costs by increasing local control and competition in prisons.He says some will argue that the prime minister side-stepped perhaps the biggest issue of all, the fact there are consistently high numbers of people in prison.Last month, the outgoing chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales said conditions in adult prisons had deteriorated over the past five years.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Mr Cameron's proposals were ""only part of the equation - you have got to look at what drives crime"" but the focus was long overdue.Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Prisons are currently violent and overcrowded....""We need action now to tackle sentence inflation and the profligate use of prison. Then the prime minister's vision can become a reality.""Simon, who was released from prison in June after serving 16 years of a life sentence, told the BBC ""more professional staff, more support and more education"" was key.""Taking a humane and personal approach towards addressing offending behaviour, allows them to access support and build a better self - to the benefit of all in society.""The prime minister said governors would have control over the way they run their prisons. This would include ""total discretion"" on budgets, and the ability to opt out of some of the thousands of pages of rules and regulations set in Whitehall.""We need prisons. Some people - including, of course, rapists, murderers, child abusers, gang leaders - belong in them,"" he said.""I also strongly believe that we must offer chances to change; that for those trying hard to turn themselves around, we should offer hope; that in a compassionate country, we should help those who've made mistakes to find their way back onto the right path.""The prime minister said ministers would legislate to require foreign criminals to declare their nationality in court as presently this does not take place early enough ""and this can hamper our ability to deport them"".Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer welcomed the government plans but said the ""scandalous failure David Cameron condemns is his own"". He said: ""The Tories have had five years to improve our prisons and we have heard promises of 'rehabilitation revolution' many times before.""The plan to give prison governors more autonomy develops ideas floated by Justice Secretary Michael Gove last year. Prisoners who acquired new skills or qualifications could ""earn"" their release, Mr Gove suggested.The prime minister has already announced plans to find alternatives to custody for pregnant women or new mothers and confirmed that a pilot scheme to track offenders by satellite would launch later this year.And in November last year the government said nine new prisons would open in England and Wales under plans to close Victorian-era jails in a bid to save about £80m a year."
2016-02-08,Osborne's target brings 'tax rise risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35519880,"Chancellor George Osborne's ""inflexible"" budget surplus target may mean sudden tax rises or spending cuts, independent economists suggest.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne's pledge to run a budget surplus ""in normal times"" from 2019-20 was simple but would require a ""precarious balancing act"".The result could be ""big tax rises or spending cuts with very little notice"", the IFS concluded.The next Budget is on 16 March.The IFS publishes its annual Green Budget document ahead of the actual Budget every year, highlighting economic conditions and the challenges facing the chancellor.The independent economic think tank has concluded that Mr Osborne's target of a balancing the UK's books by 2019-20 was inflexible, and could have tax and spending implications were he to receive ""unfavourable"" economic and fiscal forecasts.The UK had only run a surplus eight times in the last 60 years, the IFS pointed out.""The rule has the merit of simplicity and transparency but is very inflexible and this could come at a cost,"" the IFS said.""Even if the chancellor gets to the March 2019 Budget with his plans intact, past errors in official forecasts suggest that there would be more than a one-in-four chance that he would need to implement in-year tax rises or spending cuts to deliver a budget surplus in 2019-20.""Mr Osborne knows that he can set as many fiscal mandates as he likes, the public are unlikely to notice.What they are likely to notice is whether the economic growth they so regularly hear trumpeted by the chancellor is actually making a difference to their lives.And this is where another part of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Green Budget comes in.Yes, the threat of further tax rises and possible public sector cuts might be very real, but the chancellor's political advisors know that one of the key motivators of voting behaviour is whether people feel, and actually are, better off.And there the figures are pretty gloomy.Read more from Kamal hereIn the meantime, the chancellor still had a programme of promised tax cuts to deliver, faced uncertainty over what the Treasury might receive in tax, and needed to maintain a squeeze on government spending.For example, the government has promised to allow workers a larger amount of income before they start paying income tax - a promise that will cost £8bn a year and which is currently unfunded.The IFS said that even if economic figures were good, the forecast of a budget surplus by the end of the decade assumes putting up fuel duties in line with inflation, taking child benefit away from more high-earning families, and allowing more households to be dragged into the 45% top rate of income tax by keeping the threshold frozen at £150,000.Uncertainty over what will happen to the UK economy meant he might have to respond with some ""tough decisions"", the IFS concluded.""How he responds to any further unpleasant fiscal surprises may, more than anything we have seen so far, come to define his period as chancellor,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS.Oxford Economics, which co-authored the report with the IFS, is predicting ""relatively disappointing"" UK growth of 2.2% in 2016, but said strong consumer spending had seen a ""sugar rush"" owing to low inflation caused by low oil prices. This was likely to continue. The environment for business investment remained ""favourable"", it added.The Bank of England, in its latest Inflation Report, cut its forecast for growth this year to 2.2%. In November it had predicted growth of 2.5%."
2016-02-08,'Hoping' for Heathrow decision in July,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35525373,"The Transport Secretary has said he ""very much hopes"" a decision on where to build a new runway in southern England will be taken by late July.Patrick McLoughlin was giving evidence to Parliament's Transport Committee.He also denied the delay in making the decision had anything to do with May's London mayoral election - where the anti-Heathrow expansion Zac Goldsmith is standing for the Conservatives.Mr McLoughlin insisted the delay was based on environmental concerns.Last year, the Davies Commission, looking at how to increase airport capacity in the south east of England, recommended the building of a third runway at Heathrow rather than a second one at Gatwick.But Conservative MP for Richmond Park and North Kensington, and candidate for London Mayor, Zac Goldsmith has long pledged to resign as an MP and force a by-election if the Conservatives decided to go ahead with the airport's enlargement.Asked by Transport Committee chair, Louise Ellman whether the delay in making a decision on where to build a new runway had anything to do with the mayoral election in May, Mr McLoughlin said: ""We knew when the mayoral election was going to be when we said we hoped to take a decision, when we hoped to take a decision. ""So I think to somehow now say the only reason we're not taking a decision is because of the mayoral election is not really credible. But I know that's what some people want to interpret on that."" The transport secretary said it was in fact Sir Howard Davies' own evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee late last year that caused the government to postpone its decision on where to build the runway. Mr McLoughlin said Sir Howard's evidence to the Committee on environmental impact was ""an issue"" and did cause the government ""to pause"".He added that the mayoral election and potential referendum on the UK's membership of the EU could impact on the timing of any announcement on airport expansion but that he ""very much hoped"" the decision would be made before the Summer recess at the end of July."

It would not be fair.""Mr Carmichael has already suffered very publicly the consequences of this court's rebuke.""Jonathan Mitchell QC, for the petitioners, told the court there had been a public interest in bringing the case and pointed out they had successfully argued several points.After hearing legal arguments from both sides, Lady Paton said: ""In all the circumstances, exercising our discretion, we consider this to be in effect a case with divided success.""Accordingly, we find no expenses due to or by any party.""At the time of the original ruling last year, Mr Carmichael said he was ""absolutely delighted"" with the decision to refuse the petition, adding that he recognised there had been a lapse in his conduct.He described it as a ""highly politically-motivated"" case.The contents of the memo, published in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the election campaign in April, claimed that SNP leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, would secretly prefer Tory leader David Cameron as prime minister rather than his Labour opponent Ed Miliband.The newspaper said the first minister's comments, reportedly made to the French ambassador, undermined claims that she wanted to build a ""progressive alliance"" with other left-wing parties.Mr Carmichael claimed in a Channel 4 TV interview at the time that the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a reporter.He had in fact authorised his special advisor to leak the memo, an action he admitted days after being elected.In the ruling, Lady Paton said Mr Carmichael had told a ""blatant lie"" in the Channel 4 interview - but that section 106 of the Representation of the People Act did not apply to lies in general.The judges said they had been left with a ""reasonable doubt"" about whether the lie could be characterised as a false statement of fact ""in relation to [his] personal character or conduct"".They held that his election was not void."
2016-02-08,Councils to get funding cuts support,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35526161,"Councils across England likely to be hardest hit by cuts to central government funding are to be given an extra £300m over the next two years.Local Government Secretary Greg Clark announced the ""transitional"" cash in a statement to Parliament, saying he had listened to the concerns of councils.He also announced what he said was a £90m increase in funding for rural councils in 2017.Labour said local government was still facing a financial disaster.The Local Government Association (LGA) said it was pleased there would be extra money to ease the effects of funding cuts but councils would still face financial challenges.Speaking in the Commons, Mr Clark said the provisional local government settlement announced in December - which outlined cuts to central government funding of 6.7% between 2016 and 2020 - would go ahead as planned following a public consultation.This comes on top of a near 30% cut in funding between 2010 and 2015.Mr Clark said the state of the public finances meant that any change to the pace of cuts was ""extraordinarily difficult"" but he said he would be offering additional financial support to councils likely to suffer the ""sharpest reduction"" in funding in the first two years. ""I will make additional resources available in the form of transitional grant as proposed in the response to the consultation by colleagues in local government,"" he said. ""The grant will be worth £150m a year paid over the first two years.""Mr Clark said £32.7m of this funding would be available to rural councils. Coming on top of a five-fold rise in the value of the services delivery grant from £15.5m to £80.5m in 2017, he said an extra £93m in total would be available to meet the concerns of rural councils. ""This proposal means there is no deterioration in government funding for rural areas compared with urban areas for the years of this statutory settlement,"" he told MPs.Labour's Jon Trickett said the short-term funding was welcome but insubstantial compared to the billions in extra funding that councils would have to find to pay for extra spending obligations in social care and other areas.""It reminds me of nothing more than someone speeding along the road into a disaster who then says 'I will take my foot off the accelerator' without changing the destination. Because local government is facing a disaster.""LGA chairman Lord Porter said: ""The LGA has been working hard with the government on behalf of all councils - both publicly and privately - to highlight the financial challenges they face over the next few years.""We are pleased it has listened to our fundamental call for new money to be found to smooth out funding reductions for some councils in 2016-17 and beyond without any other councils losing out further as a result.""He added: ""Funding reductions will still be challenging for councils over the next four years. Any extra cost pressures will have to be funded by councils finding savings from elsewhere."""
2016-02-08,Brittan abuse inquiry 'fully justified',https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35517197,"The Metropolitan Police investigation of a rape allegation against the late Lord Brittan was ""fully justified"", a review has concluded.Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but the report said the alleged victim's account was ""far from fanciful"".But the review - by Dorset Police - agreed the case was more ""likely to lead to acquittal than conviction"".Lord Brittan died last year unaware the inquiry against him had been dropped.The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that the former Conservative peer had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967, but the case was reopened less than a year later.Officers interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought.Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January 2015 aged 75.The review - carried out by Deputy Chief Constable James Vaughan from Dorset Police - found the case was examined by ""skilful and tenacious"" investigators. However, he did identify a number of weaknesses with the inquiry including the failure to tape an interview with Lord Brittan because recording equipment broke down.  By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny ShawThe Vaughan review's conclusions slipped on to the Home Affairs Committee website almost unnoticed - but with so much rumour and speculation about Scotland Yard and Operation Midland, the findings of an official report should demand our attention. Although the review identifies a series of errors with the rape inquiry, it broadly supports it.It contradicts the view of the detective first put in charge, Paul Settle, who told MPs he disagreed with the decision to reopen the case and that questioning Lord Brittan would have been a ""baseless witch hunt"".  The review says there were ""ample reasonable grounds"" for an interview and the inquiry couldn't have properly progressed without it.  Some critics will claim the review is meaningless because it's the ""police investigating the police"". But it shines a rare light on secretive investigative work. Its comment that the ""operational context"" the Met was working in was ""extraordinary"" and ""very stretched"" with numerous complex and high-profile cases is particularly telling.  It suggests that the strain of having to take on so many cases might affect their quality.  Amid continuing controversy about Operation Midland, the investigation into alleged abuse by high-profile figures, the Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz has revealed that Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has agreed to appear in front of MPs on 23 February. Scotland Yard has declined to comment on press reports that Sir Bernard is planning to apologise to Lord Brittan's widow and to Lord Bramall.  The former head of the Army was interviewed by police in connection with allegations of historical child abuse but was told last month no further action would be taken against him.In October, the Met published key findings from an internal report into the handling of the Lord Brittan case.It revealed investigating officers told the complainant in April that there would not have been a prosecution for rape had Lord Brittan still been alive.However, Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time as the complainant was. ""This would have permitted them to clarify the position with Lady Brittan, for which the MPS apologised in a letter to her solicitors on 6 October 2015,"" the report concluded.Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the Crown Prosecution Service had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.Labour MP Tom Watson, now the party's deputy leader, has been criticised for intervening in the case and refusing to apologise to the Brittan family for his outspoken claims.Mr Watson, a longstanding campaigner on exposing allegations of sexual abuse, wrote to Director for Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders in April 2014, calling for the case to be reviewed.However, the letter was only passed to the police on 2 June after Lord Brittan was questioned."

Welsh Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said the leaked legal advice was ""embarrassing"".The UK government said it did not comment on leaks.New rules for industrial action would mean strikes affecting key public services are allowed only if backed by 40% of those eligible to vote.But opponents in Wales and Scotland have argued that the UK government cannot impose such measures on public services which are devolved. First Minister Carwyn Jones has threatened to defy Westminster by passing Welsh laws on strikes even if it results in another Supreme Court battle over where responsibility lies.As the House of Lords prepared to discuss the bill on Monday, a leaked letter marked ""sensitive"" emerged, signed by Skills Minister Nick Boles.It indicated that legal advice suggested that while the measures would apply to Scotland as a matter reserved to Westminster, there was a ""very weak case"" where Wales was concerned.The letter added that some concessions could be made to ""take some of the heat out of the DAs' [devolved administrations] opposition to the Bill"".Mr Andrews said: ""This is embarrassing for the Tory government. ""Their own legal advice confirms what we already know, that they have a very weak case for legislating in this area. ""The Bill as it stands is a clear breach of the devolution settlement. ""We repeat our call for the UK government to drop the clauses relating to public services that are the responsibilities of devolved administrations.""Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said: ""The legal case for implementing the Trade Union Bill in Wales is evaporating, and the moral case never existed.""A UK government spokesman said it was ""committed to implementing the Trade Union Bill to fairly balance the right to strike with the rights of millions of people to go about their daily lives"".Earlier, Baroness Morgan of Ely, a Labour peer, said she would seek to amend the bill to limit its impact on Wales.""While the Tories seem intent on waging a war against hardworking doctors, teachers and firefighters, in Wales we have a Welsh Labour government that respects and values our public services and works with them, not against them,"" she said.""The UK government would be acting with high handed arrogance if it continued to pursue this path of imposing the Trade Union Bill on public service provision in Wales, and it is highly likely that they would be acting unconstitutionally."""

Deputy First Minister John Swinney and UK Treasury minister Greg Hands met in Edinburgh.The row concerns how much should be cut from the block grant once Scotland gains new tax powers.  Both the Scottish government and the UK Treasury said they would continue to seek a solution. Speaking after the latest talks, Mr Hands said: ""We discussed a number of issues, there are still a number of issues out there.""I think we need to get a deal that is fair to tax payers in Scotland and fair to tax payers across the UK.""That is one of the key considerations of the Smith agreement - tax payer fairness - and we need to make sure we can get a deal that both governments can sell to their parliaments as well.""Mr Swinney told BBC Scotland: ""We are working very hard to try to secure an agreement but I don't think we should underestimate the scale of the issues that we have to overcome to secure that agreement.""We want a position whereby the tax payers in Scotland and tax payers in the rest of the UK are no better and no worse off as a consequence of the devolution of these responsibilities.""He added: ""I am not going to set any barriers in the way of getting an agreement. I am determined to get an agreement - but only one that is fair to Scotland.""Scottish ministers had previously said they want a fiscal framework deal agreed this week so it can be scrutinised by Holyrood.The breakthrough needed on the fiscal framework will underpin new powers for Holyrood.It has been claimed the block grant ministers in Edinburgh get from the Treasury could be cut by £7bn if certain calculations are used.But the UK government has insisted that a good deal is on the table.On Sunday, Mr Swinney pledged that key documents used to agree any new funding deal for Scotland would be published for scrutiny.Shadow Scottish Secretary, Labour MP Ian Murray, said it was ""deeply disappointing"" that a deal had not been reached.He added: ""Both John Swinney and Greg Hands need to clear their diaries until a deal is done. This deal is now all that stands between our politicians and the powers necessary to make Scotland fairer. ""We all agree on that - it's time to get on with it."""

2016-02-08,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-08,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-08,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-08,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-08,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-08,Campaign battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35522695,"Campaigning for the EU referendum is effectively under way already even though we don't yet know when it will be held or what the final package of reforms to the UK's membership that David Cameron will put to the British public.Another unknown factor to add to the mix is the question of which will be the official campaigns on the In/Remain and Out/Leave sides.While a plethora of groups have been set up to argue the case for the UK to stay in or leave the EU, to quote Christopher Lambert from the cult movie Highlander, ""there can be only one"" when it comes to the official lead campaign for either side. So how does the process work?Referendums are relatively rare in British political history but when they do happen, they are governed by a series of protocols and rules enshrined in law. One of these is that a lead campaign is officially designated on each side, if it meets certain criteria. For instance, in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Better Together was chosen as the official pro-UK lead campaign while Yes Scotland was chosen as the official pro-independence lead group.The Electoral Commission, which is in charge of making sure the EU referendum is a fair contest, will make the decision. The choice is very important, not merely for the increased media profile it confers on the chosen campaigns but also for the financial benefits.The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts on TV and radio, free mail shots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000.On one side of the fence, the state of play looks relatively straightforward. Britain Stronger In Europe is the main, and as yet unchallenged, campaign group making the case for the UK's continued membership of the EU. Although the SNP and Labour have both said they will run their own separate campaigns, and there are other internal Tory groups, this umbrella body - which is chaired by former M&S chair Lord Rose - commands broad support among those who believe the UK's future lies within the EU.However, it is a very different picture among those arguing that leaving the EU will benefit Britain. At the moment, there are three rival groups who could all ultimately vie for the nod from the Electoral Commission.Six months ago, it looked like a straight fight between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. The former was spawned out of the Business for Britain group, a longstanding Eurosceptic lobby group which campaigned for the UK to overhaul its status with the EU. It has historic links with the Conservative Party - it is now chaired by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson and its campaign director is Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove. It also has experience of fighting and winning referendums. Its chief executive Matthew Elliott ran the successful No 2 AV campaign in 2011, which opposed any change to the electoral system. Its deputy chairman is Labour donor John Mills and it includes UKIP's MP, Douglas Carswell, amongst its backers.Leave.EU is a different animal altogether. It was set up last July by businessman Arron Banks, a former Conservative donor who became one of UKIP's biggest supporters in the run-up to last year's election, It has drawn most of its support from UKIP activists and portrayed itself as more of a popular movement focused on immigration.Relations between the two groups have never been cordial, amid claims of hidden agendas, differences in strategies, and failing to reach out to others in the Out camp. Amid signs that their differences were irreconcilable, a new outfit - Grassroots Out - sprung up last month and has gained support. GO was formed by Tory MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour's Kate Hoey. It has since won the backing of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and his MEPs and its events have been attended by former ministers Liam Fox and David Davis as well as members of the DUP.All of the groups concerned are making big play of their cross-party credentials and being a ""broad church"". This is not a coincidence.Any group seeking the official designation has to meet a series of criteria, set down by the watchdog. In other words, it has to pass a series of tests. One of these is demonstrating that it commands support from across the political spectrum. The other criteria are:The Electoral Commission has said it will chose ""whichever of the applicants appears...to represent to the greatest extent those campaigning for that outcome"".However, it is not as simple as that. The watchdog has the power to reject all applications to be the lead campaign on the grounds they do not meet the criteria set down in the 2000 Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act.To do this, however, would be highly unusual and controversial.Whichever Out campaign is chosen is likely to influence the tone and conduct of the campaign as well as who its figurehead is. Nigel Farage is likely to play a much more prominent role if either Leave.EU or Go is chosen - with the campaign likely to have the issues of immigration and security at its heart. Many Tory Eurosceptics - including a number of Cabinet ministers - will feel more comfortable with Vote Leave, which wants, according to UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, to have a ""broad-based, optimistic, upbeat campaign"", with a focus on what they claim will be the economic benefits of leaving the EU. Labour Eurosceptics, at the moment, seem uncertain about which horse to back, with John Mills - the founder of Labour Leave - insisting that it remains affiliated to Vote Leave despite rumours to the contrary. The watchdog has said it will publish details of the designation process once David Cameron has named the date for the referendum, which could happen as early as Monday 22 February, if a deal on his draft renegotiation package is agreed by EU leaders the previous weekend.The timing of the process will be among details set out in legislation relating to the EU poll that will have to be approved by MPs. With the prospect of the referendum itself taking place in late June, campaigners on both sides will be keen for the watchdog to make a speedy decision, potentially before the Easter holiday at the end of March.  The Scottish referendum campaigns were designated on 23 April 2014, just under five months before the referendum was held on 18 September. While the period is likely to be slightly shorter this time, activists will be arguing that time is of the essence in getting their message across.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-08,Osborne's big worry,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35523334,"Here's a starter for ten: What was Ed Balls' Fiscal Rule?Any takers?  No? At the back there, come on, you must have been paying attention.Well, the then shadow chancellor announced it in 2014.Labour, he said, would make a ""binding fiscal commitment"" to ""balance the books, deliver a surplus on the current budget and get the national debt falling in the next Parliament"".Whether this was economically literate was not really the point - it was a political offer to the public with one central message: you can trust Labour with the public finances.George Osborne's ""fiscal mandate"" is attempting something similar.The chancellor has pledged to run a surplus from 2019-20 ""in normal times"".Give that ""in normal times"" covers a whole host of possibilities - and certainly allows for a large margin of wriggle room - this again is a political rather than concrete economic offer.Now, the Treasury seems to think such offers to the public are useful in as much as they signal the same approach to the public finances - you can trust us - as Mr Balls attempted in 2014.But the fact that I'm not sure a lot of readers of this blog would have been able to answer my starter for ten at the beginning of this post reveals a deeper truth.Mr Osborne knows that he can set as many fiscal mandates as he likes, the public are unlikely to notice.What they are likely to notice is whether the economic growth they so regularly hear trumpeted by the chancellor is actually making a difference to their lives.And this is where another part of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Green Budget comes in.Yes, the threat of further tax rises and possible public sector cuts might be very real, but the chancellor's political advisors know that one of the key motivators of voting behaviour is whether people feel, and actually are, better off.And there the figures are pretty gloomy.As I pointed out last week, one of the most important points in the Bank of England's report on the state of the UK economy was that wage growth was slowing.Low inflation, immigration, the use of cheaper technological solutions and companies keener on repairing balance sheets than paying people more money have meant that the pre-financial crisis relationship between high employment levels and wage inflation (that one has a tendency to lead to the other, illustrated by the Phillips Curve) is stuttering.Last year the Bank made the confident prediction that real incomes would rise by 3.75%.That has now been downgraded to 3%.Now, of course, with inflation at 0.2% that is still an increase.But after the 2009-14 ""great pay squeeze"" which saw median incomes for all employees fall by over 9% in real terms, there is still a long way to go before economic growth releases a more confident ""feel good factor"" among the employed.Yes, consumer spending is rising, as this morning's Barclays Spend Trends report reveals.However, the fear is that the increase is being driven by increasing debt as people take advantage of ultra-low interest rates to access cheap loans.Low wage growth is an economic problem for the chancellor.As the IFS argues, lower wage growth means lower tax income which feeds the case that Mr Osborne may have to raise fresh taxes or find further cuts in public spending to meet his ""fiscal mandate"".These will only be slightly offset by the increases mandated by the National Living Wage, as much of that increase will be paid to those below the present tax threshold.Low wage growth is also a political problem.Ask most people what the fiscal mandate is and you will probably receive a pretty blank stare.Ask people if their wages are going up fast enough, and the answer will be a lot more vocal."
2016-02-08,Junior doctors row,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35503712,"Amid all the claim and counterclaim about anti-social-hours payments, on-call duties and long working days, it's easy to get bogged down in the detail of the junior doctors dispute.But as we prepare for the second strike by medics in England in the contract row on Wednesday, it's worth stopping for a moment to ask why this row matters.Of course, how much doctors get paid for working weekends is clearly important to them - and, as taxpayers, the rest of us. And if the quality of care at weekends improves as a result of this contract, as the government argues it will, it goes without saying that matters too.But there is another element to this dispute, which is arguably much more fundamental than either of these issues: it's about the changing nature of healthcare - and how we respond to it.Since the health service was created in the aftermath of World War Two, it has gone from a service where patients either died or were cured of their illness to one where people are surviving but having to sometimes live with debilitating conditions. It's a success story in many ways. We are now surviving heart attacks, strokes and cancer in a way that would have been unimaginable when the NHS was formed in 1948.But that has brought with it challenges. There are about 15 million people living with what are classed as chronic illnesses such as dementia, heart disease and diabetes - for which there is no cure. Many of these people are elderly and need careful support and care.15mpeople in England have a long-term health conditionBy 2025, that could be18m 70% of the NHS Budget is spent on caring for themIt has meant that hospitals are now full of incredibly sick and frail patients who would simply not have been alive 20, perhaps even 10 years ago. One in four hospital beds is occupied by dementia patients, for example.That means the lives of junior doctors are very different to what they were in previous generations. More is being asked of them in terms of dealing with large numbers of ill patients. One medic told me how at weekends she could regularly be in charge of 80 really sick patients - all of whom ideally need huge amounts of care and support. The doctors feel run ragged and undervalued.It is this that is clearly contributing to the ""high level of discontent"" in the workforce referred to by Sir David Dalton, the hospital chief executive brought in to negotiate with the British Medical Association, in his letter to ministers after the latest breakdown of talks. But this isn't just unique to junior doctors. A similar theme has emerged in general practice where last week we heard that many GPs feel they can no longer provide adequate care to their patients, while demands from care homes meant there needed to be a complete re-think of how their residents are cared for.This is because as hospitals have had to cope with more and more really sick patients, a lot of the care that was once done there has been pushed out into the community. GPs now run asthma clinics, provide diabetes care and even carry out minor operations, while dealing with patients who are living with a range of different illnesses.Now a lot of people may say, 'So what? There are lots of different jobs where people could argue more and more is being asked of them too. What makes being a doctor so special?' The simple answer - and it is one the profession puts time and time again - is that the work they do affects people in a much more profound way than other professions. What, after all, could be more fundamental than an individual's health?And so, even when this dispute is over, we will still be left with an even more intractable problem.

2016-02-08,Brexit: The Irish Question,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35502736,"There is little sign of the scars of the past in Newry these days - the Georgian High Street looks prosperous, and the modern shopping centre which has been developed along the quayside of the town's 18th Century canal is buzzing with life. But the small group of public officials and local activists I met in a cafe there all remember when this area saw the Troubles at their most savage.And they associate the changes that have come, thanks to the peace process, with the benefits that have flowed from EU membership.Newry is just north of Northern Ireland's border, and Conor Patterson, now chief executive of the Newry and Morne Enterprise Agency, recalled what it was like to cross it in the bad old days. ""My mother was from Dundalk (in the Republic), so we travelled every week from Newry to Dundalk, and experienced weekly what the hard border meant in practice,"" he says. ""That was long queues - not just through the security border but thereafter at the customs post… it was really tough.""Pamela Arthurs, chief executive of East Border Region, a local authority-led cross-border organisation, worries about a Brexit threat to the stability which, she says, has been brought to the region by £2.4bn of EU funding. ""The concern we would have is if there was a Brexit, what would the alternative be?"" she asks. ""Are we assured that the amount of money would continue?""Listen to Brexit: The Irish Question by Ed Stourton on BBC Radio 4's Analysis programme on Monday 8 February at 20:30 GMT, or catch up via the iPlayerThe UK's EU referendum: Everything you need to knowWhat will happen when?Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeFull coverage of the EU referendumUnionists who want to leave the EU bridle at the idea that it would undermine the peace process. ""We have come through far, far more difficult challenges to the political institutions in the peace process than this issue,"" says Nigel Dodds, MP for Belfast North and deputy leader of the DUP. ""The peace process was based on a desire to move Northern Ireland forward, away from years and decades of violence. That's not going to be interrupted or disadvantaged by whatever decision we make on the EU membership issue.""But the way the peace process has been raised as an issue in Northern Ireland reflects an important dimension to the forthcoming referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. The Brexit debate can look very different from different parts of the United Kingdom. Since the last time we voted on Europe - in 1975 - there has been a constitutional revolution.The devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies has changed the relationship between the constituent parts of the UK profoundly. Dr Jo Hunt of Cardiff University, who studies the impact of devolution on the way government works in the UK, says that the ""devolved parts of the UK have developed their own relations with the European Union"", and argues that that is likely to be reflected in the way people vote. In Northern Ireland the most important factor which makes the Brexit debate different is the border.It is the UK's only land border with another sovereign state, which runs for more than 300 miles (483km) from Carlingford Lough on the Irish Sea to Lough Foyle in the North West. And fears that it might become a so-called ""hard"" border have prompted Dublin to get involved in the the UK's internal debate in a way some Unionists resent.""When you have two countries that are linked in the way our countries are, with a land border between us and extraordinary economic, political, historical people-to-people links, anything that puts a barrier between them has to be a negative thing from our point of view,"" says Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador in London. His Prime Minister, Enda Kenny, went a step further and, on a recent trip to London, warned that a Brexit could cause ""serious difficulties"" for Northern Ireland. ""I don't dispute that Irish Republic leaders and politicians have a right to express a view as far as it affects the Irish Republic,"" says the DUP's Nigel Dodds. ""I am critical when Enda Kenny comes to the UK and says a decision to leave is bad for Northern Ireland.""   And ""leave"" campaigners challenge the assumption that the border would change radically. Veteran MP Kate Hoey who was born in Northern Ireland and is co-chair of Labour Leave says: ""I don't see a situation where we would end up with big barriers up."" ""I see no reason if we were not in the European Union why we wouldn't build a good relationship with the Republic that would work out a lot of these issues"".Sinn Fein has in the past been sceptical about some aspects of the EU, but they will be in the ""stay"" camp, and it sees the possibility of what Martina Anderson - one of the party's MEPs - calls a ""constitutional opportunity"". If the leave campaign wins but Northern Ireland votes to stay, it will, like the SNP in Scotland, push for a second, separate referendum there. ""The days of Mother England wagging its finger to Scotland, Wales and to us in the North, and that we would be pulled out of the EU if the people of Northern Ireland are against that, are over,"" Anderson says.Many of these positions, of course, reflect local political concerns, but their impact could be felt right across the UK. Cardiff University's Dr Jo Hunt argues that the referendum ""is far more than just a question about remaining in the EU. It is about our constitutional future"".Devolution has, she points out, been ""an ongoing and evolving"" process.""This,"" she believes, ""could be seen as a trigger button."""
2016-02-08,Collectors' item?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35474095,"I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - ""Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008""); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect). And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. ""John 4 leader"", it says.I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.He's struck ""absolutely the right note"" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his ""rigidity"". Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is ""obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago"" and ""didn't want to listen, didn't want to change"".Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the ""prawn cocktail offensive"" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes. Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010. I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's ""easy to deal with"". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.      Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading ""a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us"".For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes: Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.So I'll put the ""John 4 leader"" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case."
2016-02-08,Albion Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209010211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35470281,"Britain could take the road that leads out of Europe - or, to be more precise, the EU - in just 139 days' time. If that is to happen, who will drive the decision? The answer highlights some significant divisions in British society.Prof John Curtice, pretty much the only poll watcher to emerge from the last election with his reputation enhanced, says that ""those who want to leave the European Union are demographically very distinctive - most distinctive of all are those who have relatively little in the way of educational qualifications"". The figures from the most recent British Social Attitudes survey in 2014 are stark. Just 35% of those who have no qualifications want to remain in the EU compared with 78% of those with university degrees. If you travel to Albion Street in the market town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, it's pretty clear why. To many of the people who work here, the EU looks like a club that doesn't much want them as members. It appears to be run by wealthy, well-educated men in suits for wealthy, well-educated men in suits. Julie McLeod, 46, who works at Brown & Wenman opticians, is typical of the sort of voter who could take us out of the EU. ""I'm a bit sceptical really of the whole Europe thing. I think they control too much of our laws,"" she told me. ""You want a situation where the British government can decide what the British government wants to do. We need a bit more say.""Julie, like many women voters, has not yet decided for certain how she'll vote. If Leave is to win, they need to convince many more people like her that the benefits of quitting outweigh the risks. Like so many others, immigration - and our government's inability to control it - is what bothers her most. Next door on Albion Street, shopkeeper Tim Smart spells out how he believes the recent influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has affected him, his family and his town. He complains that those who come here have an unfair advantage as not only do they speak their own languages but they go to English schools and learn to speak English as well. ""If they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position anywhere, who would you employ? Someone who speaks two languages or someone who speaks one language? My daughter has just had it in Northampton, funnily enough. It doesn't feel like a level playing field in my eyes.""Tim speaks for those who believe that immigration control is not simply a question of the country being too full, or of race or religion, but is a question of fairness.It is people like him who David Cameron has in mind when he talks of ending ""something for nothing"" by limiting the in-work benefits EU migrants can get. It was a proposal that emerged from intensive polling and countless focus groups, although so far he's had to water the idea down.Another sign that you may well be in favour of leaving the EU is your age. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to get out. It's an irony that the one group that have already had a vote on Europe - anyone aged 58 or older who could have voted when the last referendum was held in 1975 - are precisely the people who now want another chance to reverse the decision taken back then.The British Social Attitudes survey shows that almost half - 46% - of those over 55 want to get out while half that number - 23% - of those under 35 agree with them.Speaking to Kenneth Spinks, who's 85, you get a sense of why. He feels that he was invited to vote to join an economic club in which it was easier and cheaper to buy and sell things - the Common Market as it was known then - and has instead found himself governed by a big, bossy, bureaucratic organisation in Brussels.I spoke to him in the local Conservative Club. One more sign that you might be a Leaver is that you voted Conservative at the last election. Tory voters are much less likely to be pro-EU than those of other parties - other than UKIP, of course. That is why the draft deal David Cameron unveiled this week matters so much. Many Conservative voters - the people who backed the prime minister just last May - will be inclined to follow his lead just as Labour voters followed Harold Wilson's back in 1975. Kenneth couldn't have been clearer that he wants to quit Europe until we had this exchange.Me: ""You're a staunch Tory man, but even if the Tory leader says, 'I want us to stay in, I think it's in the best interest of the country,' you'd vote against him, would you?Kenneth: ""Well, it's all according to what he'll come back with. If he'll come back with something that's really good, it might sway me a bit.""Take a few more paces along Albion Street and you'll find the last crucial group of potential ""leavers"" - small businesspeople who, unlike those who run big companies, don't export to Europe but do still have to put up with its rules.Aaron Lee, 28, who runs Lee & Sons Cleaning Services, says:  ""All we're doing is paying out fortunes of money to join this trading union, and being told what we can and can't do. ""For example, we can only use a certain power Hoover because they've governed the power rating down. Where we could Hoover a floor in an hour, it's now going to take us two.""The Leave campaign cannot win simply by building a coalition of old, non graduate, self-employed voters. They will need - and, indeed, already have - support from younger, well-educated people who work for big businesses too. However, it is these divisions in society that could determine the future of our country for decades to come.The Today programme will be running a separate piece later on which voters are most likely to vote for the UK to remain in the EU."

Ex-shadow defence minister Kevan Jones said Ms Thornberry had taken questions ""but didn't answer any"", adding that she had been ""waffly and incoherent"".Some MPs told reporters outside the room that she had said Trident could soon be as obsolete as the Spitfire fighter aircraft was after the Second World War.Ms Thornberry said she had been trying to explain that Trident may be overtaken by technology such as underwater drones, which were being developed to track submarines.""The idea of the Trident replacement is that it can hide in the sea. If technology is moving faster than that then it may well be that Trident may not be able to hide.""And if that's right, and if we are to bet everything on 'mutually assured destruction', we have to be assured that it will work - and if it cannot hide any more then that is a problem.""She told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday that ""four, five or six people kicked-off"" at Monday evening's meeting of Labour MPs but they did not necessarily represent the whole Parliamentary party.  She said she had wanted to challenge those who had said ""it has to be Trident"" or nothing.Asked why she did not just admit that she was against nuclear weapons, she said it was important to discuss all options.""We need to have all the options on the table and we need to have a proper debate within the party,"" she told Today.Labour peer Admiral Lord West, a former home office minister, telephoned into the Today programme during Ms Thornberry's interview to say that her argument about underwater drones was ""nonsense"".She said the Chinese, Americans and Russians would not be spending billions on research if there was nothing in it.Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.The submarines carry up to 8 Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads.Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons systemMr Burnham had earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We always knew this was going to be a difficult debate for the party - there are two positions here that are difficult to reconcile, maybe impossible to reconcile, and the party's got to find some way of accommodating those positions and move forward and not let this issue take over everything.""Defence analyst Paul Ingram, from the British American Security Information Council, said the advent of new technology meant it may no longer be possible for submarines to go undetected in 20 years.This was a ""particular problem"" for the UK, he told BBC Radio 4's World at One, because it was the only nation that was ""entirely dependent"" on submarines for its nuclear capability.Jeremy Corbyn is a longstanding opponent of nuclear weapons but some MPs and peers have threatened to resign if Labour reverses its decades-long support for British missiles. Others are understood to be thinking of making clear their personal support for Trident renewal to voters at the next election, if the party puts disarmament in its manifesto. Ms Thornberry's review is due to be published in the summer but MPs could be asked to vote on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet before that.Renewing the Trident fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade, is estimated by the government to cost £31bn, although opponents claim the final bill will be far higher than that. Union leaders have warned that scrapping Trident could devastate communities reliant on the defence industry. But Scottish Labour will argue against renewing Trident in May's Holyrood elections having agreed its position last autumn.Kezia Dugdale, Scottish Labour leader, told the BBC there had been a ""healthy debate"" in the party in Scotland and it now had an ""honest position"".

2016-02-09,Watchdog's web monitoring bill fear,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35531721,"Plans to authorise mass data collection and hacking by Britain's spies do not do enough to protect privacy, a watchdog has warned.The extent of the intelligence agencies' computer and internet spying operation has recently become clear.The draft Investigatory Powers Bill is meant to put it on a firm legal footing.But the Intelligence and Security Committee says the bill lacks clarity and is a ""missed opportunity"".""Given the background to the draft Bill and the public concern over the allegations made by Edward Snowden in 2013, it is surprising that the protection of people's privacy - which is enshrined in other legislation - does not feature more prominently,"" says the committee's report.""One might have expected an overarching statement at the forefront of the legislation, or to find universal privacy protections applied consistently throughout the draft Bill. ""However, instead, the reader has to search and analyse each investigatory power individually to understand the privacy protections which may apply. ""This results in a lack of clarity which undermines the importance of the safeguards associated with these powers.""Committee chairman, Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, said: ""We have therefore recommended that the new legislation contains an entirely new part dedicated to overarching privacy protections, which should form the backbone of the draft legislation around which the exceptional powers are then built. This will ensure that privacy is an integral part of the legislation rather than an add-on.""Mr Grieve added: ""The draft bill appears to have suffered from a lack of sufficient time and preparation.""The Home Office is due to publish a final, amended version of the bill later this year. The draft bill, which is one of the longest pieces of legislation to be considered by MPs in recent years, would force internet service providers to store web browsing records of everyone in the UK for a year.This is meant to help the police and security services keep pace with technology being used by terrorists and organised criminals.But security chiefs told the ISC, a cross-party committee of MPs and peers, that they already ""have a range of other capabilities which enable them to obtain equivalent data"" so this part of the bill will mainly be used by the police.The ISC wants to restrict the scope of proposed ""equipment interference"" warrants, allowing spies to hack into suspects' smartphones and computers and download data from them. either within the UK or abroad.Given that the ""targeted"" warrants could cover ""a target as broad as an entire hostile foreign intelligence service"" it is not clear why ""bulk"" warrants are also included in the bill, the committee says.The committee is also concerned about the downloading of large databases, which might include medical or bank records, known as bulk personal data sets, to aid investigations.Dominic Grieve said: ""Given that each Bulk Personal Dataset potentially contains personal information about a large number of individuals - the majority of whom will not be of any interest to the agencies - the committee considers that each dataset is sufficiently intrusive that it should require a specific warrant. ""We therefore recommend that Class Bulk Personal Dataset warrants are removed from the legislation.""The draft bill allows the security services to hold - but not use - bulk personal data sets for a temporary period without a warrant in certain circumstances.This could happen, the report says, when the data has been acquired ""opportunistically,"" without the time to apply for a warrant, but it means the agencies could hold the data without authorisation indefinitely which was clearly ""not appropriate"".The committee is also calling for more clarity about the privacy safeguards to be applied to the examination of material gathered by the trawling of internet traffic passing through the UK, a practice revealed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.The draft bill is being scrutinised by a joint parliamentary committee which is due to report on Thursday.The ISC, which took evidence in private from Home Secretary Theresa May and the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, has confined its scrutiny to the parts of the bill that relate to secret intelligence material, which other committees cannot see.Sir Francis Richards, a former head of GCHQ, said said the agencies already had most of the powers they needed but the bill was needed to increase transparency and public confidence in a ""post-Snowden"" world.""The old legislation was designed to be obscure because there was not supposed to be any public understanding of the agencies' techniques,"" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.There was now a need to ""put the record straight"" but the draft bill, in his view, struck the right balance between security and privacy.The ISC report was welcomed by civil liberties campaigners.Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: ""Rushing through legislation has to stop. It's time for a proper debate about whether bulk surveillance powers are acceptable in a democracy like the UK."""
2016-02-09,Last-minute talks over doctor strike,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35531115,"A strike by junior doctors in England will go ahead on Wednesday after last-minute talks ended with no resolution.The Department of Health said informal talks with the British Medical Association had finished for the day.The second 24-hour walk-out will begin at 08:00 GMT, with NHS England saying 1,150 planned inpatient procedures and 1,734 day procedures will be cancelled.It comes as fresh details emerge about how close the two sides got on a deal during failed Acas talks in January.The BBC understands the British Medical Association (BMA) put forward a proposal that would have seen doctors' basic pay rise by about half the 11% offered by ministers in return for Saturday not to be treated as a normal working day.The union argued it would have been cost neutral, meaning the government would not pay any more than the £5bn currently spent on junior doctor salaries.The offer was rejected and during a debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Labour MP Justin Madders asked Mr Hunt whether he had personally blocked an agreement.Mr Hunt did not directly answer the question, but said the BMA was the ""only reason"" a solution has not been found.Sources close to the talks have told the BBC that the proposal was put to the government, but did not leave enough flexibility for rostering more doctors on at weekends - one of the main reasons the government wants to renegotiate the contract.The junior doctors row explainedHow close did both sides get to a deal?What exactly do junior doctors do?How does your job compare?The lessons of the 1975 doctors' strikeAnalysis: Why should we care?Doctors maintain that the strike will cause minimal disruption to patients.In preparation for Wednesday, more than 2,800 routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, have already been cancelled.Dr Anne Rainsberry, of NHS England, said: ""The NHS is doing everything possible to minimise the impact of this regrettable strike which will delay care for thousands of patients at a time of year when service pressures across the health service are already at their highest.""We will monitor the situation across the country to ensure plans are in place, and people are ready to respond to any significant increases in pressure in any region over the period of this strike.""During the first strike in January, 4,000 operations had to be cancelled - about one in 10 of the total.In response to the last-minute talks taking place, the BMA said: ""As things stand, no further movement has been made by government and industrial action planned for tomorrow will go ahead.""Have you been affected by the junior doctors' strike?

2016-02-09,Call to tighten up hospitality rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35526160,"Government departments have been urged to be ""more stringent"" over accepting corporate hospitality and gifts.A National Audit Office review found officials were justified in accepting most offers but some were questionable in terms of relevance and frequency.Tickets to sporting events, bottles of champagne and iPads accepted by senior officials may not have been consistent with official guidelines, it said.The Cabinet Office said the clear principles in place were working well. Under the guidelines, officials are only supposed to attend functions and accept gifts when they are in the interests of government, and the offer is proportionate without presenting any conflict of interest.The spending watchdog examined how rules on acceptance and disclosure of corporate hospitality had worked across Whitehall between 2012 and 2015, focusing in particular on three departments: the Department for Business (BIS), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Defence, Equipment and Support (DE&S) arm of the Ministry of Defence. It found that senior officials accepted gifts and hospitality on 3,413 occasions over the period, from nearly 1,500 different organisations. The Department for Business accounted for the most (718), while the Department for International Development (20) had the fewest instances. While lunches and dinners accounted for more than 60% of hospitality, only 40 gifts were reported over the period.In 2014-2015, the 200 most senior officials in Whitehall accepted an estimated £29,000 in overall hospitality, with BIS officials accounting for the most, an estimated £7,170. Over the same period, it is estimated that BIS officials as a whole accepted £35,000 worth of hospitality and gifts, compared with £100,000 at DE&S and £19,000 at HMRC.The watchdog said most of these were routine sandwich lunches, dinners and drinks receptions which were ""reasonable"" for officials to attend and in line with government business.But it said there were exceptions, with officials accepting tickets to football matches, including the FA Cup semi-final, tennis games at Wimbledon, movie premieres and pop concerts. In some cases, officials were also accompanied by their spouses or their children.Gifts accepted that were deemed to be disproportionate, in terms of their value, included a hamper from Fortnum and Mason, a £300 painting and a £300 Mont Blanc pen, although the latter was surrendered to officials. Some officials at DE&S were also deemed to have overstepped the mark in terms of the frequency with which they accepted hospitality from defence companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group. Although there was no evidence of hospitality or gifts causing a conflict of interest, the watchdog said meetings with firms such as Deloitte or PwC, that provide services to government, risked a perception of conflict.It also questioned the decision of officials to accept hospitality from the British Bankers Association when some of its members were subject to regulatory and criminal investigations.""Public officials are sometimes offered gifts and hospitality by external stakeholders which it is reasonable for them to accept,"" said Amyas Morse, the NAO's director general. ""This can however, undermine value for money or affect government's reputation.""While most, but not all cases, declared by officials appear on the face of it to be justifiable in the normal course of business, we found some weakness in the oversight and control of gifts and hospitality. This needs to be addressed by the Cabinet Office and departments.""Details of hospitality and gifts accepted by senior civil servants were first made public in 2009. Departments are required to publish registers four times a year. Twelve out of 17 departments managed to meet this quarterly target between 2012 and 2015, the watchdog said. The Cabinet Office, which drew up the official guidelines, welcomed the report, saying it ""showed that the system is working well, with offers of hospitality being recorded and properly acted upon"". ""Clear and well understood principles governing the acceptance of gifts and hospitality are in place for all civil servants,"" a spokeswoman said. ""This government is the most transparent ever and publishes an unprecedented range of information about gifts and hospitality received by ministers, special advisers and senior civil servants."""

2016-02-09,UK goods trade gap biggest on record,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35530340,"The UK's trade gap with the rest of the world widened by £300m in 2015, official figures show.The deficit - the difference between the amount the UK imports and what it exports - stood at £34.7bn in 2015, the Office for National Statistics said.The figures also contained December's trade data, which showed the deficit narrowed by £1.3bn in the month.The goods deficit also fell, to £9.9bn from £11.5bn in November, thanks to a fall in imports of £1.7bn in December.The trade deficit is one of the factors cited by analysts as a drag on UK economic growth, which has been exacerbated by the strengthening pound over the past few years. A stronger pound makes UK exports more expensive for overseas customers."

2016-02-09,Pilot in prisons seeks to cut violence,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35518477,"Six ""reform prisons"" are to be created in England and Wales as part of a pilot to tackle high levels of violence and re-offending, David Cameron has said.The governors would have autonomy over their operation and budgets, he said.The PM also announced new powers to speed up the deportation of foreign inmates and plans for all jails to be assessed through league tables.Penal charities said reforms would not work if prisoners were ""crammed into filthy institutions with no staff"".Downing Street said the creation of the ""reform prisons"" from existing jails would happen by the end of the year, although it did not name any locations.Mr Cameron said ""current levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm should shame us all"", with a typical week seeing 600 incidents of self-harm, at least one suicide and 350 assaults including 90 on staff.In what he described as the ""biggest shake-up of prisons since the Victorian era"", he said prisoners should be seen as ""potential assets to be harnessed"" and the ""failure of our system today is scandalous"".In other developments:Ahead of his speech to the Policy Exchange think tank in central London, Mr Cameron was shown around HMP Onley, a category C prison near Rugby, where he met prisoners being trained in bicycle repair and barista skills.Mr Cameron said the government would accept the recommendations made in Dame Sally Coates's review of prison education, due to be published soon, including a promise to protect the £130m budget. 85,641prisoners147prisoners per 100,000 population14,247 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults 595 serious assaults on staff 89 self-inflicted deaths 32% of offenders with one previous custodial sentence re-offend Former Liberal Democrat MP and education minister David Laws will help develop a new scheme through organisations such as TeachFirst to encourage graduates to take up teaching posts in prisons.BBC home editor Mark Easton says the government will try to square the circle of pushing up standards without pushing up costs by increasing local control and competition in prisons.He says some will argue that the prime minister side-stepped perhaps the biggest issue of all, the fact there are consistently high numbers of people in prison.Last month, the outgoing chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales said conditions in adult prisons had deteriorated over the past five years.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Mr Cameron's proposals were ""only part of the equation - you have got to look at what drives crime"" but the focus was long overdue.Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Prisons are currently violent and overcrowded....""We need action now to tackle sentence inflation and the profligate use of prison. Then the prime minister's vision can become a reality.""Simon, who was released from prison in June after serving 16 years of a life sentence, told the BBC ""more professional staff, more support and more education"" was key.""Taking a humane and personal approach towards addressing offending behaviour, allows them to access support and build a better self - to the benefit of all in society.""The prime minister said governors would have control over the way they run their prisons. This would include ""total discretion"" on budgets, and the ability to opt out of some of the thousands of pages of rules and regulations set in Whitehall.""We need prisons. Some people - including, of course, rapists, murderers, child abusers, gang leaders - belong in them,"" he said.""I also strongly believe that we must offer chances to change; that for those trying hard to turn themselves around, we should offer hope; that in a compassionate country, we should help those who've made mistakes to find their way back onto the right path.""The prime minister said ministers would legislate to require foreign criminals to declare their nationality in court as presently this does not take place early enough ""and this can hamper our ability to deport them"".Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer welcomed the government plans but said the ""scandalous failure David Cameron condemns is his own"". He said: ""The Tories have had five years to improve our prisons and we have heard promises of 'rehabilitation revolution' many times before.""The plan to give prison governors more autonomy develops ideas floated by Justice Secretary Michael Gove last year. Prisoners who acquired new skills or qualifications could ""earn"" their release, Mr Gove suggested.The prime minister has already announced plans to find alternatives to custody for pregnant women or new mothers and confirmed that a pilot scheme to track offenders by satellite would launch later this year.And in November last year the government said nine new prisons would open in England and Wales under plans to close Victorian-era jails in a bid to save about £80m a year."
2016-02-09,Cameron's mum signs anti-cuts petition,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-35532047,"David Cameron's mother has signed a petition against cuts to children's centres in his constituency.Mary Cameron, 81, has put her name to a campaign against plans by Conservative-run Oxfordshire County Council to close a number of the centres, according to the Daily Mirror.The BBC has seen a petition which shows the signature of Mary Cameron alongside her middle name and post code.Downing Street declined to comment on the reports or the petition.Retired magistrate, Mrs Cameron, told the newspaper: ""My name is on the petition but I don't want to discuss this any further.""She reportedly signed the petition while visiting her son in Oxfordshire.Oxfordshire County Council leader Ian Hudspeth refused to comment on Mrs Cameron's signing of the petition or the planned cuts.Campaigners are trying to stop the closure of nearly all of Oxfordshire's 44 children's centres - the county council wants to keep eight hubs, to save £8m pounds.The petition describes the proposals as a ""false economy"", and says the early intervention services provide numerous economic and other long-term benefits.Campaign organiser Jill Huish said she was ""not surprised"" to have the Prime Minister's mother's endorsement.""It shows how deep austerity is cutting our most vulnerable when even David Cameron's mum has had enough,"" she said.""While our local authority and our prime minister squabble over who's fault it is that there are 95 separate cuts planned for Oxfordshire, we are the people who will suffer without our frontline services.""Council workers are to stage a 24-hour strike in protest at the plans.The prime minister previously wrote to the local authority in his capacity as MP for Witney expressing ""disappointment"" at planned cuts to museums, libraries and day centres for the elderly.But council leader Mr Hudspeth hit back, saying the cuts were the result of reductions in funding from central government.Members of Unite employed in early intervention by Oxfordshire County Council will walk out on strike on February 16 after voting overwhelmingly for industrial action.Unite regional officer Chris Gray said his members were ""deeply committed"" to the children and families they worked with.""But they have decided that they cannot sit back and watch while the council denies Oxfordshire's young people a future and destroys its top class children's early intervention service."""
2016-02-09,PM denies scaremongering over 'Jungle',https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35519210,"David Cameron has rejected the idea he is ""scaremongering"" by claiming migrant camps like the ""Jungle"" in Calais could move to England if the UK left the EU.The PM said a vote to leave would give French politicians the chance to ""tear up"" the deal which lets UK border guards check passports at Calais.Campaigners for the UK to leave the EU say the deal is between the two countries and not an EU deal.UKIP said the PM's claim was ""based on fear, negativity and falsehood"".The 13-year agreement with France had ""nothing to do with our EU membership,"" said Vote Leave, while Leave.EU said there was ""no reason for this to change on leaving the EU"". Mr Cameron's former defence secretary Liam Fox said he was ""sad and disappointed to see our prime minister stoop to this level of scaremongering"", while fellow Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said Mr Cameron was ""taking voters for fools"".An in-out referendum on EU membership has been promised by the end of 2017, although it is widely expected to be at the end of June, if Mr Cameron can secure agreement to his reform proposals at the next summit of EU leaders on 18 February.About 5,000 migrants and refugees trying to reach the UK are thought to live at the ""Jungle"" camp in Calais.Under the terms of the February 2003 Le Touquet treaty between the UK and France, checks for migrants trying to illegally stow away on lorries or trains heading for Britain are carried out by British border guards at a number of French ports. Under the system of ""juxtaposed controls"", which was transposed into UK law in June 2003, the UK operates immigration checkpoints in Calais and Dunkirk, while France has a checkpoint at Dover. Analysis: By BBC assistant political editor Norman SmithAsked about the suggestion that he was ""scaremongering"" by linking a vote to leave the EU with the moving of the Calais migrant camps to the south coast of England, Mr Cameron said it was a very real risk.""There are any number of opposition politicians in France who would love to tear up the excellent agreement we have with France to make sure that we have our borders on their side of the Channel - I don't think we should give those politicians any excuse to do that,"" he said.""If we can get this deal in Europe, if we can get this renegotiation fixed and we can stay in a reformed Europe, you know what you get. You know the borders stay in Calais.""The deputy Mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, bolstered his case by telling the BBC: ""We will have to cancel these agreements, because England won't be in Europe anymore. So that will really be a foreign country for us.""But the UK's former chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, told the BBC's World at One he didn't think the UK's exit from the EU would lead to an immediate collapse in cross border arrangements with France.""I don't necessarily think this would collapse overnight. If it didn't exist there would still be border controls. We would have to rely on the Belgians and the French,"" he said. Mr Vine pointed out asylum seekers could only claim asylum once they were on British soil. The 'Treaty of Le Touquet' is an agreement between France and the UK that has been in place since 2003 and governs border control arrangements and immigration. The treaty ensures that immigration checks are carried out before passengers embark on cross channel services - French Border Police have immigration checkpoints at Dover while  the UK has immigration checkpoints at Calais and Dunkirk. But at Calais and Dunkirk, passengers also go through French exit checks, as well as UK immigration entry checks.In theory this stops those seeking to reach the UK from doing so without their immigration status being checked first. But this has also led to the establishment of camps in Calais such as the so-called Jungle and previously, Sangatte.The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Cameron's warning was a sign that Downing Street was planning to emphasise what it sees as the important contribution the EU makes to the country's national security.But Vote Leave said Mr Cameron's claims had no basis in reality. ""UK border controls are in France because of a bilateral treaty, not because of our EU membership, and a result of the camps in Calais, not the cause of them,"" said Matthew Elliott, the campaign group's chief executive.""Clearly, No 10 is in a blind panic over the failing renegotiation.""Leave.EU co-founder, Arron Banks said: ""The agreement we have to process migrants in Calais is with France, not the EU. There is no reason for this to change on Leaving the EU.""The key issue here is that we should not have to accept migrants that have arrived from a safe country. The scandal of countries effectively waving migrants through Western Europe to our shores will only end when we are able to control our borders again.""Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum specialMr Cameron has been touring European capitals trying to build support for his draft renegotiation package, which he has said is the basis for a new settlement for Britain in the EU but which has been dismissed as inconsequential by those wanting to leave the EU.Mayor of London Boris Johnson, a key figure in the Conservative Party, has said the case for staying or leaving is ""finely balanced"" and he would only decide which way to campaign when the terms of the final agreement were known.""This is the moment to stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, squint down the barrel and only when you see the whites of their eyes should you finally let fly and decide whether to stay or leave the EU,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

2016-02-09,Osborne's target brings 'tax rise risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35519880,"Chancellor George Osborne's ""inflexible"" budget surplus target may mean sudden tax rises or spending cuts, independent economists suggest.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne's pledge to run a budget surplus ""in normal times"" from 2019-20 was simple but would require a ""precarious balancing act"".The result could be ""big tax rises or spending cuts with very little notice"", the IFS concluded.The next Budget is on 16 March.The IFS publishes its annual Green Budget document ahead of the actual Budget every year, highlighting economic conditions and the challenges facing the chancellor.The independent economic think tank has concluded that Mr Osborne's target of a balancing the UK's books by 2019-20 was inflexible, and could have tax and spending implications were he to receive ""unfavourable"" economic and fiscal forecasts.The UK had only run a surplus eight times in the last 60 years, the IFS pointed out.""The rule has the merit of simplicity and transparency but is very inflexible and this could come at a cost,"" the IFS said.""Even if the chancellor gets to the March 2019 Budget with his plans intact, past errors in official forecasts suggest that there would be more than a one-in-four chance that he would need to implement in-year tax rises or spending cuts to deliver a budget surplus in 2019-20.""Mr Osborne knows that he can set as many fiscal mandates as he likes, the public are unlikely to notice.What they are likely to notice is whether the economic growth they so regularly hear trumpeted by the chancellor is actually making a difference to their lives.And this is where another part of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Green Budget comes in.Yes, the threat of further tax rises and possible public sector cuts might be very real, but the chancellor's political advisors know that one of the key motivators of voting behaviour is whether people feel, and actually are, better off.And there the figures are pretty gloomy.Read more from Kamal hereIn the meantime, the chancellor still had a programme of promised tax cuts to deliver, faced uncertainty over what the Treasury might receive in tax, and needed to maintain a squeeze on government spending.For example, the government has promised to allow workers a larger amount of income before they start paying income tax - a promise that will cost £8bn a year and which is currently unfunded.The IFS said that even if economic figures were good, the forecast of a budget surplus by the end of the decade assumes putting up fuel duties in line with inflation, taking child benefit away from more high-earning families, and allowing more households to be dragged into the 45% top rate of income tax by keeping the threshold frozen at £150,000.Uncertainty over what will happen to the UK economy meant he might have to respond with some ""tough decisions"", the IFS concluded.""How he responds to any further unpleasant fiscal surprises may, more than anything we have seen so far, come to define his period as chancellor,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS.Oxford Economics, which co-authored the report with the IFS, is predicting ""relatively disappointing"" UK growth of 2.2% in 2016, but said strong consumer spending had seen a ""sugar rush"" owing to low inflation caused by low oil prices. This was likely to continue. The environment for business investment remained ""favourable"", it added.The Bank of England, in its latest Inflation Report, cut its forecast for growth this year to 2.2%. In November it had predicted growth of 2.5%."

2016-02-09,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster.

2016-02-09,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-09,Campaign battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35522695,"Campaigning for the EU referendum is effectively under way already even though we don't yet know when it will be held or what the final package of reforms to the UK's membership that David Cameron will put to the British public.Another unknown factor to add to the mix is the question of which will be the official campaigns on the In/Remain and Out/Leave sides.While a plethora of groups have been set up to argue the case for the UK to stay in or leave the EU, to quote Christopher Lambert from the cult movie Highlander, ""there can be only one"" when it comes to the official lead campaign for either side. So how does the process work?Referendums are relatively rare in British political history but when they do happen, they are governed by a series of protocols and rules enshrined in law. One of these is that a lead campaign is officially designated on each side, if it meets certain criteria. For instance, in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Better Together was chosen as the official pro-UK lead campaign while Yes Scotland was chosen as the official pro-independence lead group.The Electoral Commission, which is in charge of making sure the EU referendum is a fair contest, will make the decision. The choice is very important, not merely for the increased media profile it confers on the chosen campaigns but also for the financial benefits.The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts on TV and radio, free mail shots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000.On one side of the fence, the state of play looks relatively straightforward. Britain Stronger In Europe is the main, and as yet unchallenged, campaign group making the case for the UK's continued membership of the EU. Although the SNP and Labour have both said they will run their own separate campaigns, and there are other internal Tory groups, this umbrella body - which is chaired by former M&S chair Lord Rose - commands broad support among those who believe the UK's future lies within the EU.However, it is a very different picture among those arguing that leaving the EU will benefit Britain. At the moment, there are three rival groups who could all ultimately vie for the nod from the Electoral Commission.Six months ago, it looked like a straight fight between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. The former was spawned out of the Business for Britain group, a longstanding Eurosceptic lobby group which campaigned for the UK to overhaul its status with the EU. It has historic links with the Conservative Party - it is now chaired by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson and its campaign director is Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove. It also has experience of fighting and winning referendums. Its chief executive Matthew Elliott ran the successful No 2 AV campaign in 2011, which opposed any change to the electoral system. Its deputy chairman is Labour donor John Mills and it includes UKIP's MP, Douglas Carswell, amongst its backers.Leave.EU is a different animal altogether. It was set up last July by businessman Arron Banks, a former Conservative donor who became one of UKIP's biggest supporters in the run-up to last year's election, It has drawn most of its support from UKIP activists and portrayed itself as more of a popular movement focused on immigration.Relations between the two groups have never been cordial, amid claims of hidden agendas, differences in strategies, and failing to reach out to others in the Out camp. Amid signs that their differences were irreconcilable, a new outfit - Grassroots Out - sprung up last month and has gained support. GO was formed by Tory MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour's Kate Hoey. It has since won the backing of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and his MEPs and its events have been attended by former ministers Liam Fox and David Davis as well as members of the DUP.All of the groups concerned are making big play of their cross-party credentials and being a ""broad church"". This is not a coincidence.Any group seeking the official designation has to meet a series of criteria, set down by the watchdog. In other words, it has to pass a series of tests. One of these is demonstrating that it commands support from across the political spectrum. The other criteria are:The Electoral Commission has said it will chose ""whichever of the applicants appears...to represent to the greatest extent those campaigning for that outcome"".However, it is not as simple as that. The watchdog has the power to reject all applications to be the lead campaign on the grounds they do not meet the criteria set down in the 2000 Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act.To do this, however, would be highly unusual and controversial.Whichever Out campaign is chosen is likely to influence the tone and conduct of the campaign as well as who its figurehead is. Nigel Farage is likely to play a much more prominent role if either Leave.EU or Go is chosen - with the campaign likely to have the issues of immigration and security at its heart. Many Tory Eurosceptics - including a number of Cabinet ministers - will feel more comfortable with Vote Leave, which wants, according to UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, to have a ""broad-based, optimistic, upbeat campaign"", with a focus on what they claim will be the economic benefits of leaving the EU. Labour Eurosceptics, at the moment, seem uncertain about which horse to back, with John Mills - the founder of Labour Leave - insisting that it remains affiliated to Vote Leave despite rumours to the contrary. The watchdog has said it will publish details of the designation process once David Cameron has named the date for the referendum, which could happen as early as Monday 22 February, if a deal on his draft renegotiation package is agreed by EU leaders the previous weekend.The timing of the process will be among details set out in legislation relating to the EU poll that will have to be approved by MPs. With the prospect of the referendum itself taking place in late June, campaigners on both sides will be keen for the watchdog to make a speedy decision, potentially before the Easter holiday at the end of March.  The Scottish referendum campaigns were designated on 23 April 2014, just under five months before the referendum was held on 18 September.

At the back there, come on, you must have been paying attention.Well, the then shadow chancellor announced it in 2014.Labour, he said, would make a ""binding fiscal commitment"" to ""balance the books, deliver a surplus on the current budget and get the national debt falling in the next Parliament"".Whether this was economically literate was not really the point - it was a political offer to the public with one central message: you can trust Labour with the public finances.George Osborne's ""fiscal mandate"" is attempting something similar.The chancellor has pledged to run a surplus from 2019-20 ""in normal times"".Give that ""in normal times"" covers a whole host of possibilities - and certainly allows for a large margin of wriggle room - this again is a political rather than concrete economic offer.Now, the Treasury seems to think such offers to the public are useful in as much as they signal the same approach to the public finances - you can trust us - as Mr Balls attempted in 2014.But the fact that I'm not sure a lot of readers of this blog would have been able to answer my starter for ten at the beginning of this post reveals a deeper truth.Mr Osborne knows that he can set as many fiscal mandates as he likes, the public are unlikely to notice.What they are likely to notice is whether the economic growth they so regularly hear trumpeted by the chancellor is actually making a difference to their lives.And this is where another part of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Green Budget comes in.Yes, the threat of further tax rises and possible public sector cuts might be very real, but the chancellor's political advisors know that one of the key motivators of voting behaviour is whether people feel, and actually are, better off.And there the figures are pretty gloomy.As I pointed out last week, one of the most important points in the Bank of England's report on the state of the UK economy was that wage growth was slowing.Low inflation, immigration, the use of cheaper technological solutions and companies keener on repairing balance sheets than paying people more money have meant that the pre-financial crisis relationship between high employment levels and wage inflation (that one has a tendency to lead to the other, illustrated by the Phillips Curve) is stuttering.Last year the Bank made the confident prediction that real incomes would rise by 3.75%.That has now been downgraded to 3%.Now, of course, with inflation at 0.2% that is still an increase.But after the 2009-14 ""great pay squeeze"" which saw median incomes for all employees fall by over 9% in real terms, there is still a long way to go before economic growth releases a more confident ""feel good factor"" among the employed.Yes, consumer spending is rising, as this morning's Barclays Spend Trends report reveals.However, the fear is that the increase is being driven by increasing debt as people take advantage of ultra-low interest rates to access cheap loans.Low wage growth is an economic problem for the chancellor.As the IFS argues, lower wage growth means lower tax income which feeds the case that Mr Osborne may have to raise fresh taxes or find further cuts in public spending to meet his ""fiscal mandate"".These will only be slightly offset by the increases mandated by the National Living Wage, as much of that increase will be paid to those below the present tax threshold.Low wage growth is also a political problem.Ask most people what the fiscal mandate is and you will probably receive a pretty blank stare.Ask people if their wages are going up fast enough, and the answer will be a lot more vocal."
2016-02-09,Junior doctors row,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35503712,"Amid all the claim and counterclaim about anti-social-hours payments, on-call duties and long working days, it's easy to get bogged down in the detail of the junior doctors dispute.But as we prepare for the second strike by medics in England in the contract row on Wednesday, it's worth stopping for a moment to ask why this row matters.Of course, how much doctors get paid for working weekends is clearly important to them - and, as taxpayers, the rest of us. And if the quality of care at weekends improves as a result of this contract, as the government argues it will, it goes without saying that matters too.But there is another element to this dispute, which is arguably much more fundamental than either of these issues: it's about the changing nature of healthcare - and how we respond to it.Since the health service was created in the aftermath of World War Two, it has gone from a service where patients either died or were cured of their illness to one where people are surviving but having to sometimes live with debilitating conditions. It's a success story in many ways. We are now surviving heart attacks, strokes and cancer in a way that would have been unimaginable when the NHS was formed in 1948.But that has brought with it challenges. There are about 15 million people living with what are classed as chronic illnesses such as dementia, heart disease and diabetes - for which there is no cure. Many of these people are elderly and need careful support and care.15mpeople in England have a long-term health conditionBy 2025, that could be18m 70% of the NHS Budget is spent on caring for themIt has meant that hospitals are now full of incredibly sick and frail patients who would simply not have been alive 20, perhaps even 10 years ago. One in four hospital beds is occupied by dementia patients, for example.That means the lives of junior doctors are very different to what they were in previous generations. More is being asked of them in terms of dealing with large numbers of ill patients. One medic told me how at weekends she could regularly be in charge of 80 really sick patients - all of whom ideally need huge amounts of care and support. The doctors feel run ragged and undervalued.It is this that is clearly contributing to the ""high level of discontent"" in the workforce referred to by Sir David Dalton, the hospital chief executive brought in to negotiate with the British Medical Association, in his letter to ministers after the latest breakdown of talks. But this isn't just unique to junior doctors. A similar theme has emerged in general practice where last week we heard that many GPs feel they can no longer provide adequate care to their patients, while demands from care homes meant there needed to be a complete re-think of how their residents are cared for.This is because as hospitals have had to cope with more and more really sick patients, a lot of the care that was once done there has been pushed out into the community. GPs now run asthma clinics, provide diabetes care and even carry out minor operations, while dealing with patients who are living with a range of different illnesses.Now a lot of people may say, 'So what? There are lots of different jobs where people could argue more and more is being asked of them too. What makes being a doctor so special?' The simple answer - and it is one the profession puts time and time again - is that the work they do affects people in a much more profound way than other professions. What, after all, could be more fundamental than an individual's health?And so, even when this dispute is over, we will still be left with an even more intractable problem.

2016-02-09,Brexit: The Irish Question,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35502736,"There is little sign of the scars of the past in Newry these days - the Georgian High Street looks prosperous, and the modern shopping centre which has been developed along the quayside of the town's 18th Century canal is buzzing with life. But the small group of public officials and local activists I met in a cafe there all remember when this area saw the Troubles at their most savage.And they associate the changes that have come, thanks to the peace process, with the benefits that have flowed from EU membership.Newry is just north of Northern Ireland's border, and Conor Patterson, now chief executive of the Newry and Morne Enterprise Agency, recalled what it was like to cross it in the bad old days. ""My mother was from Dundalk (in the Republic), so we travelled every week from Newry to Dundalk, and experienced weekly what the hard border meant in practice,"" he says. ""That was long queues - not just through the security border but thereafter at the customs post… it was really tough.""Pamela Arthurs, chief executive of East Border Region, a local authority-led cross-border organisation, worries about a Brexit threat to the stability which, she says, has been brought to the region by £2.4bn of EU funding. ""The concern we would have is if there was a Brexit, what would the alternative be?"" she asks. ""Are we assured that the amount of money would continue?""Listen to Brexit: The Irish Question by Ed Stourton on BBC Radio 4's Analysis programme on Monday 8 February at 20:30 GMT, or catch up via the iPlayerThe UK's EU referendum: Everything you need to knowWhat will happen when?Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeFull coverage of the EU referendumUnionists who want to leave the EU bridle at the idea that it would undermine the peace process. ""We have come through far, far more difficult challenges to the political institutions in the peace process than this issue,"" says Nigel Dodds, MP for Belfast North and deputy leader of the DUP. ""The peace process was based on a desire to move Northern Ireland forward, away from years and decades of violence. That's not going to be interrupted or disadvantaged by whatever decision we make on the EU membership issue.""But the way the peace process has been raised as an issue in Northern Ireland reflects an important dimension to the forthcoming referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. The Brexit debate can look very different from different parts of the United Kingdom. Since the last time we voted on Europe - in 1975 - there has been a constitutional revolution.The devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies has changed the relationship between the constituent parts of the UK profoundly. Dr Jo Hunt of Cardiff University, who studies the impact of devolution on the way government works in the UK, says that the ""devolved parts of the UK have developed their own relations with the European Union"", and argues that that is likely to be reflected in the way people vote. In Northern Ireland the most important factor which makes the Brexit debate different is the border.It is the UK's only land border with another sovereign state, which runs for more than 300 miles (483km) from Carlingford Lough on the Irish Sea to Lough Foyle in the North West. And fears that it might become a so-called ""hard"" border have prompted Dublin to get involved in the the UK's internal debate in a way some Unionists resent.""When you have two countries that are linked in the way our countries are, with a land border between us and extraordinary economic, political, historical people-to-people links, anything that puts a barrier between them has to be a negative thing from our point of view,"" says Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador in London. His Prime Minister, Enda Kenny, went a step further and, on a recent trip to London, warned that a Brexit could cause ""serious difficulties"" for Northern Ireland. ""I don't dispute that Irish Republic leaders and politicians have a right to express a view as far as it affects the Irish Republic,"" says the DUP's Nigel Dodds. ""I am critical when Enda Kenny comes to the UK and says a decision to leave is bad for Northern Ireland.""   And ""leave"" campaigners challenge the assumption that the border would change radically. Veteran MP Kate Hoey who was born in Northern Ireland and is co-chair of Labour Leave says: ""I don't see a situation where we would end up with big barriers up."" ""I see no reason if we were not in the European Union why we wouldn't build a good relationship with the Republic that would work out a lot of these issues"".Sinn Fein has in the past been sceptical about some aspects of the EU, but they will be in the ""stay"" camp, and it sees the possibility of what Martina Anderson - one of the party's MEPs - calls a ""constitutional opportunity"". If the leave campaign wins but Northern Ireland votes to stay, it will, like the SNP in Scotland, push for a second, separate referendum there. ""The days of Mother England wagging its finger to Scotland, Wales and to us in the North, and that we would be pulled out of the EU if the people of Northern Ireland are against that, are over,"" Anderson says.Many of these positions, of course, reflect local political concerns, but their impact could be felt right across the UK. Cardiff University's Dr Jo Hunt argues that the referendum ""is far more than just a question about remaining in the EU. It is about our constitutional future"".Devolution has, she points out, been ""an ongoing and evolving"" process.""This,"" she believes, ""could be seen as a trigger button."""
2016-02-09,Collectors' item?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35474095,"I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - ""Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008""); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect). And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. ""John 4 leader"", it says.I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.He's struck ""absolutely the right note"" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his ""rigidity"". Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is ""obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago"" and ""didn't want to listen, didn't want to change"".Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the ""prawn cocktail offensive"" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes. Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010. I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's ""easy to deal with"". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.      Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading ""a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us"".For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes: Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.So I'll put the ""John 4 leader"" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case."
2016-02-09,Albion Street,https://web.archive.org//web/20160209154545/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35470281,"Britain could take the road that leads out of Europe - or, to be more precise, the EU - in just 139 days' time. If that is to happen, who will drive the decision? The answer highlights some significant divisions in British society.Prof John Curtice, pretty much the only poll watcher to emerge from the last election with his reputation enhanced, says that ""those who want to leave the European Union are demographically very distinctive - most distinctive of all are those who have relatively little in the way of educational qualifications"". The figures from the most recent British Social Attitudes survey in 2014 are stark. Just 35% of those who have no qualifications want to remain in the EU compared with 78% of those with university degrees. If you travel to Albion Street in the market town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, it's pretty clear why. To many of the people who work here, the EU looks like a club that doesn't much want them as members. It appears to be run by wealthy, well-educated men in suits for wealthy, well-educated men in suits. Julie McLeod, 46, who works at Brown & Wenman opticians, is typical of the sort of voter who could take us out of the EU. ""I'm a bit sceptical really of the whole Europe thing. I think they control too much of our laws,"" she told me. ""You want a situation where the British government can decide what the British government wants to do. We need a bit more say.""Julie, like many women voters, has not yet decided for certain how she'll vote. If Leave is to win, they need to convince many more people like her that the benefits of quitting outweigh the risks. Like so many others, immigration - and our government's inability to control it - is what bothers her most. Next door on Albion Street, shopkeeper Tim Smart spells out how he believes the recent influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has affected him, his family and his town. He complains that those who come here have an unfair advantage as not only do they speak their own languages but they go to English schools and learn to speak English as well. ""If they then apply for a job for any supermarket or any position anywhere, who would you employ? Someone who speaks two languages or someone who speaks one language? My daughter has just had it in Northampton, funnily enough. It doesn't feel like a level playing field in my eyes.""Tim speaks for those who believe that immigration control is not simply a question of the country being too full, or of race or religion, but is a question of fairness.It is people like him who David Cameron has in mind when he talks of ending ""something for nothing"" by limiting the in-work benefits EU migrants can get. It was a proposal that emerged from intensive polling and countless focus groups, although so far he's had to water the idea down.Another sign that you may well be in favour of leaving the EU is your age. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to get out. It's an irony that the one group that have already had a vote on Europe - anyone aged 58 or older who could have voted when the last referendum was held in 1975 - are precisely the people who now want another chance to reverse the decision taken back then.The British Social Attitudes survey shows that almost half - 46% - of those over 55 want to get out while half that number - 23% - of those under 35 agree with them.Speaking to Kenneth Spinks, who's 85, you get a sense of why. He feels that he was invited to vote to join an economic club in which it was easier and cheaper to buy and sell things - the Common Market as it was known then - and has instead found himself governed by a big, bossy, bureaucratic organisation in Brussels.I spoke to him in the local Conservative Club. One more sign that you might be a Leaver is that you voted Conservative at the last election. Tory voters are much less likely to be pro-EU than those of other parties - other than UKIP, of course. That is why the draft deal David Cameron unveiled this week matters so much. Many Conservative voters - the people who backed the prime minister just last May - will be inclined to follow his lead just as Labour voters followed Harold Wilson's back in 1975. Kenneth couldn't have been clearer that he wants to quit Europe until we had this exchange.Me: ""You're a staunch Tory man, but even if the Tory leader says, 'I want us to stay in, I think it's in the best interest of the country,' you'd vote against him, would you?Kenneth: ""Well, it's all according to what he'll come back with. If he'll come back with something that's really good, it might sway me a bit.""Take a few more paces along Albion Street and you'll find the last crucial group of potential ""leavers"" - small businesspeople who, unlike those who run big companies, don't export to Europe but do still have to put up with its rules.Aaron Lee, 28, who runs Lee & Sons Cleaning Services, says:  ""All we're doing is paying out fortunes of money to join this trading union, and being told what we can and can't do. ""For example, we can only use a certain power Hoover because they've governed the power rating down. Where we could Hoover a floor in an hour, it's now going to take us two.""The Leave campaign cannot win simply by building a coalition of old, non graduate, self-employed voters. They will need - and, indeed, already have - support from younger, well-educated people who work for big businesses too. However, it is these divisions in society that could determine the future of our country for decades to come.The Today programme will be running a separate piece later on which voters are most likely to vote for the UK to remain in the EU."

2016-02-10,Doctors reject 'final' contract offer,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35546369,"Junior doctors' leaders have rejected a ""final take-it-or-leave-it"" offer made by the government to settle the bitter contract dispute in England.The offer included a concession on Saturday pay, but the British Medical Association said it was not enough.The development is expected to lead ministers to announce that they are going to impose a contract on doctors.The news has emerged as doctors take part in their second 24-hour strike - due to end at 08:00 GMT on Thursday.During the walk-out they have provided emergency cover, but the stoppage has led to the cancellation of nearly 3,000 routine operations and treatments. GP care has been largely unaffected.The offer was made on Tuesday evening, on the eve of the strike, and rejected by the BMA on Wednesday afternoon when the walk-out was in full swing.The junior doctors row explainedAnalysis: Time for the nuclear option?What exactly do junior doctors do?How does your job compare?It was made by Sir David Dalton, the hospital chief executive brought in by ministers last month to broker a deal in the bitter dispute.In his letter to the union on Tuesday, he said it was a final offer and that if it was rejected it would mean there is ""no realistic prospect of a negotiated agreement"" .It would have seen those working at least one in four Saturdays get extra pay for each of the Saturdays they work.The move represented a more generous offer than previously when the bar for extra pay was set at one in three.Sir David also said the fines levied on trusts for over-working doctors would be increased, while the extra pay medics got for very long hours would be increased.But the BMA responded on Wednesday by rejecting the offer, sticking to its stance that any Saturday working should attract higher pay.The letter reiterated the union's proposal made previously that basic pay be increased by only about half the 11% offered by ministers to help pay for it.The government is now waiting for Sir David to confirm that he sees no way of resolving the dispute.It is then expected ministers will move to impose a new contract on England's 55,000 junior doctors, who represent a third of the medical workforce.The new contracts would then come into force from August. They would apply to all new junior doctors immediately but would also be imposed as existing junior doctors changed their rotations - it is expected 80% would be on it within six months.It is unclear at the moment how the BMA will respond to that prospect, although their mandate allows them to call more strikes.BMA junior doctors leader Dr Johann Malawana said the government had ""attacked"" and ""patronised"" the profession. ""The health secretary can end this dispute, but he must put politics to one side and concentrate on agreeing a fair contract that delivers for patients."""

The rules, introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland, were activated in the House of Commons for the first time last month.English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies, as part of a new stage in the legislative process for considering bills applying only to their constituents. In a report on the new system, the cross-party committee of MPs said there was ""strong English demand"" for measures to address the ""constitutional anomalies"" that devolution had brought.But it said the new provisions were ""ad hoc"", lacked transparency and appeared incompatible with the 40-year old Barnett Formula for distributing funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.""The new standing orders do require further consideration and evaluation if they are to be anything more than a short-term experiment in the House's internal procedure,"" the MPs said.""That former clerks of the House of Commons - individuals steeped in decades of learning about Parliamentary procedure - should have difficulty in discerning what these standing orders mean should raise serious further doubts about how sustainable they are.""The report said the test for whether legislation applied only to England, which is determined by the Commons Speaker, was not ""very simple"" and risked putting the Speaker in an ""unnecessarily controversial position"".The extent of the opposition to the system, which has united Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist Party, ""underlined their vulnerability"", the committee said.The SNP has said the changes are ""driving Scotland out of the door"".""With only the Conservative Party in favour of the new arrangements, these standing orders face a high risk of being overridden as soon as there is a non-Conservative majority in the House of Commons,"" it said. ""That the standing orders have attracted such hostility and can be removed on the basis of a simple majority must raise doubts as to whether they can ever be more than a temporary expedient, and currently they cannot be considered to be part of a stable constitutional settlement that will endure.""Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said the new system had little cross-party support and urged ministers to come back with ""more comprehensible proposals"" during a review later this year. A government spokesman said: ""The government is committed to a stronger Union and a fair settlement for the whole of the United Kingdom, and English votes for English laws brings an important balance to the unprecedented powers that have been devolved to other parts of the country.""We will be reviewing the operation of the standing orders later this year, drawing upon the work of both the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the House of Commons Procedure Committee."""
2016-02-10,Labour MP sorry for Tunbridge map slip,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35545829,"A Labour MP has acknowledged that he ""made a slip"" when he suggested Tunbridge Wells was in Surrey.Local government spokesman Steve Reed got his geography mixed up in a debate on the allocation of English council funding for the next four years.He later told the BBC that he had had ""many happy trips"" to the Kent town in the past and had simply made a mistake.Communities Secretary Greg Clark joked that if Mr Reed aspired to be a minister a ""bit of geography may help"".The light-hearted exchange came during a heated debate on the government's proposed financial settlement for councils in England, announced by Mr Clark, the MP for Royal Tunbridge Wells. Responding to Mr Clark's statement, Mr Reed said Surrey was the council receiving the largest slice of a £300m hardship fund to ameliorate the impact of spending cuts, adding mistakenly that this ""is where the secretary of state just happens to be an MP"".Mr Reed corrected himself following prompting by Conservative MPs. Reflecting on the error afterwards, Mr Reed said it was one of those things that occasionally happened. ""I wrongly said it was in Surrey. It is in Kent. I know it is in Kent. I have been down there before. I just got that one wrong, I'm afraid.""The MP for Croydon North, who grew up in Hertfordshire before moving to south London, said he did not believe the comments were symbolic of Labour's problems to make headway in the south of England, outside of London. ""I go camping and on day trips around the south of England. My family all live there. I love the area and feel part of it. Every now and then you make a slip.""MPs approved the government's plans for 2016 to 2020 by 315 votes to 209 despite opposition claims that proposed spending cuts of more than 6% a year would ""rip the heart out of communities"" and that Tory councils have been prioritised for ""transitional help"" ahead of May's elections.

2016-02-10,UK's EU membership talks 'fragile',https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35543871,"The man responsible for trying to broker a deal over the renegotiation of the UK's EU membership has said the process is ""fragile"".Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said he had cancelled all his engagements to focus on talks with EU leaders and senior MEPs.The UK hopes to win the backing of other EU countries for its draft reforms at a summit next week.This could pave the way for an in-out referendum to be held this summer.In recent weeks, EU officials have made positive noises about the prospect of an agreement at the Brussels meeting on 18 and 19 February.This is seen as crucial to allow David Cameron to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU on his preferred date at the end of June. But Mr Tusk has indicated the size of the task still ahead by clearing his diary to focus solely on high-level talks. He tweeted: ""Talks on UK in EU settlement a fragile political process. I cancelled all my obligations to meet EU leaders & EP to secure broad support.""Mr Cameron has been touring European capitals to try to address reservations about the package of changes he is seeking, which include limits on the payment of in-work benefits to new EU migrants, and new protections for countries outside the eurozone. Denmark is among the countries to have said they back the proposals in full but Poland has said the welfare changes need further discussion and France is reported to be unhappy about anything that would give non-eurozone countries a veto over issues affecting the entire EU. Draft conclusions of the summit, released on Tuesday, gave no indication of whether an agreement would be reached but stressed that, if it was, it would be legally-binding and compatible with existing EU treaties.Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said he believes the government has the basis of a deal over its proposed emergency brake on in-work benefits.This would see newly arrived EU migrants receive tax credits at a reduced rate during their first four years in the country as long as the UK could demonstrate its welfare system was under excessive strain. Mr Hammond told MPs that ""those countries who were expected to have been critical were impressed with the way the council has found a solution which addresses the UK's needs without trampling roughshod over their cherished principles. ""I think we've got something here which is workable,"" he added. ""There is some refinement still to do and the discussion is still underway but I think we have got the basis of a workable deal in this section."" Campaigners calling for the UK to leave the EU have dismissed the negotiation process as a ""sham"" and say it will have little impact on the UK's sovereignty and ability to control its own borders. Speaking at a rally in London, attended by Conservative, Labour, UKIP and DUP politicians, Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said proponents of EU exit were offering ""something better than the EU - an independent, prosperous and global Britain"". He urged 'Out' campaigners to extol the economic benefits of leaving the EU, which he said would lead to lower energy and food prices and a better deal for British farmers free of the Common Agricultural Policy.

2016-02-10,PM says Scotland needs to move on deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35541080,"David Cameron has urged the Scottish government to ""move towards"" his position on the fiscal framework for new devolved powers.During weekly questions at Westminster Mr Cameron said ""no one is keener on agreement"" than he was.But in a letter to Nicola Sturgeon, the PM said he was disappointed, adding that the Scottish government ""need to be prepared to move towards us"".Finance Secretary John Swinney said he would not sign up to a ""damaging"" deal.The Holyrood and Westminster governments are locked in talks over a financial deal to underpin new devolved powers.Mr Cameron told MPs he was keen to complete the ""very important piece of devolution"" in a fair way for Scotland and the rest of the UK, after SNP group leader Angus Robertson warned that ""time is running out"" for a deal.Talks over the fiscal framework have been going on for several months, and are yet to be resolved. The Scottish government is set to submit a further proposal.Holyrood's devolution committee wants a quick conclusion to the matter so any deal can be discussed in the Scottish Parliament before it is dissolved on 23 March ahead of elections in May.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to the prime minister earlier in the week outlining parts of the Scottish government's case over the ""no detriment"" principle.The Smith Commission on further powers said any deal should not impact adversely on Scotland or the rest of the UK, but Ms Sturgeon said the Treasury seemed instead to be trying to decide ""what level of detriment that Scotland should bear"".At prime minister's questions, Mr Robertson claimed the plans as they stand could cost Scotland £3bn, and said time was running out to deliver a fair deal.Mr Cameron responded that the deal struck needed to be fair for taxpayers across the UK as well as north of the border.In his reply to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron underlined his commitment to ""securing an agreement between our governments"", but warned that the Scottish government would need to be ready to compromise.He said: ""We have consistently listened to your concerns, put a number of alternatives on the table and moved substantially towards you; you will need also to be prepared to move towards us.""In the interest of reaching an agreement, we tabled a significant new proposal that would see the Scottish government retain all growth in Scottish taxes plus a share of the growth in corresponding taxes from the rest of the UK.""Addressing the matters raised by Ms Sturgeon in her letter, Mr Cameron said: ""We will not accept any proposals that would diverge systematically from the taxpayer fairness element of the Smith Agreement principle of 'no detriment'.""It would be very difficult for me to explain to taxpayers in the rest of the UK that Scotland will stop paying income tax into the central pot yet somehow still receive a share of it.""During prime minister's questions earlier in the day, Mr Cameron said he wanted to ""successfully complete this very important piece of devolution in a fair way"".He said: ""There's an ongoing negotiation to reach a fair settlement, and I would say to the Scottish first minister and the Scottish finance minister they have to recognise there has to be fairness across the rest of the UK too.""With goodwill, I can tell you that no-one is keener on agreement than me.""I want the SNP, here and in Holyrood, to have to start making decisions. Which taxes are you going to raise, what are you going to do with benefits?""I want to get rid of this grievance agenda and let you get on with a governing agenda, so we can see what you're made of.""Scottish Secretary David Mundell told MPs that the Scottish and UK governments are ""within touching distance"" of a fiscal framework deal.Labour's Ian Murray had claimed that tennis star Andy Murray's newborn daughter could win Wimbledon before a deal is done.However, Mr Mundell welcomed Ms Sturgeon's letter to Mr Cameron as good progress on the matter, saying: ""We are within touching distance of striking a deal and I remain optimistic that we will do so.""During portfolio questions at Holyrood, Scottish finance secretary John Swinney said he remained ""committed"" to the discussions.He said: ""I don't think anyone could question the amount of time and energy and commitment I have put in to trying to resolve these questions.""What I want to make clear is that we have a very difficult discussion to have to resolves the differences of opinion we have on the 'no detriment' principle.""I am committed to continuing these discussions to come to an outcome which is fair to the people of Scotland, and fair to the people of the rest of the UK - which the no detriment principle is.""What the Scottish government will not sign up to is a mechanism which is damaging to the people of Scotland.""A spokesman for Mr Swinney said Mr Cameron's letter was ""deeply disappointing"", saying it ""completely fails to engage with the central point"" of Ms Sturgeon's letter.He said: ""We will put a further proposal to the UK government this week that will meet in full the principles of the Smith Commission and which no government seeking to secure a deal based on the principles of Smith could reject. ""If the UK government is not able to reach an agreement which respects that core principle of no detriment, it would be crystal clear that they have no intention of honouring the Vow or the Smith Commission. We sincerely hope that's not the case."""
2016-02-10,Arrested MPs will not have to be named,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35540433,"Any arrested MP will not automatically be identified in the Commons after MPs backed changes to its procedures.In future, the MP involved will be consulted and named only if there is an issue of ""parliamentary privilege or constitutional significance"" at stake.The cross-party Procedure Committee said revealing names of arrested MPs was incompatible with a privacy right.Chairman Charles Walker said he was not asking for special treatment for MPs but for the law to be applied equally.The Commons approved changes to the existing rules, which require the police to notify the Speaker when an MP is arrested and for the Speaker in turn to tell the House, without a formal vote. Mr Walker, the Tory MP for Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, told the Commons that MPs should have the same rights to privacy as any other citizen, and in future their names should not be put in the public domain if they were arrested, unless this was directly connected to their role as an MP.  But objecting to the change, Labour MP John Mann argued that it would give MPs special rights in law that do not apply to everyone else.  Deputy Commons leader Therese Coffey said it was up to the Commons to decide although the government has indicated that the change brings MPs into line with the rest of the public.The Procedure Committee's recent report revealed that in the last Parliament, Tory MPs Nigel Evans and David Ruffley were named after their arrests. Mr Evans was later acquitted of sexual offences and Mr Ruffley cautioned for assault.Green MP Caroline Lucas was arrested during an anti-fracking protest and later acquitted of obstruction.Meanwhile it has emerged that police have been involved in a total of five cases linked to MPs' expenses under the current system, with none of the politicians identified.In December it emerged that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the MPs' expenses watchdog, had referred three potentially criminal cases to police in March without any public announcement, or identifying the individuals involved."
2016-02-10,Commons clash over 'right-to-buy',https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35534463,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused David Cameron of presiding over a ""very damaging housing crisis,"" at Prime Minister's Questions.Mr Corbyn said the PM had failed to replace homes sold off under ""right-to-buy"", which is being extended to housing association tenants in England.He said the government's action on housing was ""simply not good enough"".Mr Cameron hit back by saying he would ""increase the housing supply in the social sector"".He said two new homes would be built for each one sold off by local authorities in London, where shortages are the most acute.But Mr Corbyn said measures in the Housing Bill would result in the loss of 180,000 affordable homes while only one in every eight council homes sold under ""right-to-buy"" had been replaced with a social home.He accused Mr Cameron of ""overseeing a very damaging housing crisis, it's pricing out people from buying, it's not providing enough social housing, therefore many people are forced to rely on the private rented sector"". A committee of MPs earlier warned that the flagship Conservative policy of housing association tenants in England, the ""right-to-buy"" their homes, could reduce the stock of affordable housing.Those taking advantage of it will get a discount, to be funded by the sale of ""high value"" council houses.But the Commons communities and Local Government committee says this could leave councils short of cash to replace sold-off properties.It predicts a ""substantial surge"" of demand to buy homes from the 1.3 million housing association tenants in England when the new scheme comes into effect, leading to the risk that the policy will ""stall"" for lack of funds.It also raises concerns that a 1% rent cut for four years imposed on housing associations would threaten their ability to build new homes and provide other services to tenants.The government says it wants to ensure ""anybody who works hard and aspires to own their own home should have the opportunity to realise their dream"".But the Communities and Local Government committee says the funding model it is using, which will force councils to compensate housing associations with the money raised from council house sales, is ""extremely questionable"" and is effectively a ""levy"" on councils.It says the scheme should be funded by central government and questions how ministers are going to meet their target of replacing every property sold off with a new one.Potential buyers must have been tenants for at least three years, the same as with council tenants. The government says that means up to 1.3 million housing association tenants will be eligible in England. Around 500,000 housing association tenants are already eligible for some discounts. So the new scheme will extend rights to a further 800,000 tenants, and increase the discounts available.Read moreCommittee chairman Clive Betts said: ""The fundamental success of this policy depends not just on whether more tenants come to own their home but on whether more homes are built.""The government needs to set out in more detail how it will meet its target of at least one-for-one replacement of the sold homes, particularly given issues such as the availability of land, the capacity of the building industry and the uncertainty of income from council home sales.""The scheme, which is partly designed to reverse the steady decline in home ownership levels in recent years, is currently being piloted in Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Surrey, Merseyside and a number of London boroughs.It will be phased in across the rest of England in due course, although it is voluntary - housing associations are not being forced to adopt it. The government is updating interested tenants on its progress here.  Housing associations taking part in the scheme will be expected to sell properties to tenants interested in buying them at a discount of £103,900 in London and £77,900 elsewhere.The government is committed to building 400,000 new affordable homes by 2020-21. Under the the Housing Bill currently going through Parliament, local authorities make payments to government based on the value of their housing stock, on the expectation that more expensive properties would be disposed of when falling empty. Ministers say that the sums raised from selling ""high-value"" council homes will pay not only for ""right to buy"" discounts, but also for the construction of cheaper social housing to replace them and a new £1bn Brownfield Regeneration Fund to support building on derelict land.But the committee's report quotes estimates from the Chartered Institute of Housing which suggest that the sale of high-value homes will raise only £1.2bn - £2.2bn a year of the £4.5bn needed.The committee warns that the amount raised from the sale of vacant council homes will vary across the country, depending on property prices. It warned that a large number of properties sold through the existing right-to-buy scheme had quickly been put on the rental market and that it might be necessary to limit the ability of housing association tenants to become private sector landlords. It also called for safeguards to protect the amount of affordable housing in rural areas, including allowing housing associations to offer tenants ""portable discounts"" to purchase an alternative property to the one they live in where it was difficult to replace.It's more difficult to get a mortgage on an ex-local authority or housing association flat than privately-owned equivalents. The comments of the surveyor are key and various things can cause problems:The Department for Communities and Local Government said more details about the sale of vacant council houses would be set out in due course but the principle of using them to pay for new house building was the right one.""There are billions of pounds locked up in local authority housing assets. It is only right that when they become vacant they are sold enabling the receipts to be reinvested in building new homes and supporting home ownership through right-to-buy,"" a spokesman said.He added: ""Anybody who works hard and aspires to own their own home should have the opportunity to realise their dream.""Labour housing spokesman John Healey said: ""Government policies should be funded by government, not a cash-grab from councils forced to sell off their own housing to pay for right-to-buy discounts. ""Unless the legislation is changed, ministers will force cash-strapped councils to pay for their pet policy project.""The Labour government in Wales is planning to abolish right-to-buy entirely while in Scotland it will be phased out by August. A separate scheme exists in Northern Ireland."

Mr Cameron requires the approval of all 28 EU members for the package, which includes limiting in-work benefits for migrants for up to four years.Speaking to BBC's Newsnight, Mr Barroso described the UK as ""one of the most important shareholders in Europe"".But the former Portuguese prime minister said: ""The way the British look at Europe is frankly different from the way France, or Germany do.""It is not only Britain that cares about sovereignty, we all want the rights of our country respected,"" he added.He was speaking as the foreign ministers of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands resolved ""to continue the process of creating an ever closer union"".But, reflecting the differing view in the UK, they acknowledged that not every country should have to agree. Mr Cameron says his draft deal aimed at keeping Britain in the EU would deliver ""substantial change"".The deal includes an ""emergency brake"" on in-work benefits paid to EU migrants and paves the way for the UK's referendum to take place as early as June.However, when asked whether the proposed measures on in-work benefits would put anyone off from coming to the UK, Mr Barroso replied: ""No, frankly not.""""People who want to go to Britain, if the basic rights of the people are ensured, they will be willing to go but of course with slightly different conditions,"" he said.

2016-02-10,Boris Johnson's wife enters EU debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35543868,"Marina Wheeler, who is married to Boris Johnson, has entered the debate about the UK's future in the EU, urging the government to assert its opposition to the ""growing reach"" of EU laws.The barrister said draft reforms to the UK's EU membership might ""do the job politically"" but would do little to curb the ""muscle-flexing"" of EU Courts.Without action, a ""new generation of EU rights would bed down"", she arguedMr Johnson is under pressure to say whether he will back EU exit or not.The Mayor of London and Conservative MP has said he will wait until the final text of the proposed changes to the UK's membership, brokered by European Council president Donald Tusk, is agreed before deciding which way to campaign in a future referendum.He has said David Cameron is making the ""best of a bad job"" in his negotiations and pressed the prime minister to set out how any agreement will re-assert the UK's national sovereignty and guarantee the primacy of Parliament and British courts, amid speculation a law could be passed to put this beyond doubt. In an article for a human rights blog, Ms Wheeler - who recently became a QC - said the draft package of reforms negotiated by Mr Cameron, including enhanced powers for national Parliaments to group together to block EU legislation, ""raised more questions than they answered"".""The reach of the Court of Justice of the European Union has extended to the point where the status quo is untenable,"" she wrote.""Aside from eroding national sovereignty, which it does, the current situation also undermines legal certainty, which in turn undermines good governance. To limit the still-growing reach of EU law, it is not enough to use ""red cards"" to stem the flow of EU legislation.""Reform is needed to address the EU legal order, in particular the jurisdictional muscle-flexing of the Court in Luxembourg. The Tusk proposals do not do this. In fact they duck the issue entirely, leaving the way clear for a whole new generation of EU right to bed down.""A string of recent legal rulings, she argued, demonstrated that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was given legal force by the 2007 EU Lisbon Treaty was being used to ""fashion new rights"" rather than merely reaffirm those enshrined in the European Conventions of Human Rights. She said an opt-out negotiated by the last Labour government, designed to ensure the Charter was not directly enforceable in the UK, was now ""effectively dead"" and it might not now be ""practicable or legally coherent"" for the UK to try and revive it. Instead, given the concerns of certain other member states about the territorial reach of European courts, she said there was an opportunity for the UK to press for the EU's entire legal architecture to be reviewed.""We should state our position afresh,"" she wrote. ""The Charter either is, or should be, a set of principles that may guide the enactment of new EU legislation...but does not create any new rights directly enforceable by the courts in the member states or EU.""Here is a chance to restore a measure of constitutional coherence, let us not pass it by.""The European Court of Justice was set up in the 1950s to ensure EU law is interpreted and applied evenly in every EU country but many Tory MPs believe it has extended its jurisdiction into areas which should be the preserve of national law and its judicial powers should be rolled back.But, speaking on Tuesday, former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the Luxembourg court had primacy in this area and it was ""difficult to see how any piece of legislation can alter that without us being in breach of the treaties"".""The treaty of accession, and our own legislation, makes quite clear that it is the Court in Luxembourg which has the last word,"" he said."

""Until they can do that, they are a plot without a programme; a cabal without a critique.""The ""continual war of attrition"" between different camps in the party was ""achieving nothing beyond taking the pressure off the government"", he said.""So my clear message to the plotters is - stop the sniping, stop the scheming, get behind Jeremy Corbyn and start taking the fight to the Tories.""In his opposition to austerity and to foreign military interventions, Mr Corbyn was in tune with public opinion, Mr McCluskey said.The Labour leader, he said, offered a ""radical challenge to the status quo and business-as-usual politics"", likening the insurgency which propelled him to victory in September's leadership contest to US Democratic politician Bernie Sanders' current bid for the White House. ""What Jeremy Corbyn offers - like Bernie Sanders in the US - is a calling out of corporate corruption, a rejection of the austerity that has made the UK the most unequal economy in the G8 and the promise that politics and politicians can and will put things right for ordinary working people.""And he criticised those who, he claimed, were suggesting May's elections in Scotland, Wales, and across England were a referendum on the Labour leadership.""I am not a supporter of... changes designed to intimidate or undermine Labour MPs. But I also believe that we need to issue a clear warning to those who are advocating the parliamentary Labour Party being used as a lever to force Jeremy Corbyn out."" "

2016-02-10,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-10,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-10,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-10,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-10,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-10,Sovereign strategies,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35539860,"Governments rarely perform miracles but they do try to square circles. And that is what David Cameron's ministers are attempting right now with Britain's constitution.They are looking for a way of asserting the sovereignty and authority of parliament over the EU in a way that convinces voters - and Boris Johnson - that Britain's relationship with the continent is changing.But they need to do this without claiming that UK law has primacy over EU law, something that would be tantamount to leaving the EU. As you might imagine, this is not proving an easy piece of constitutional carpentry.Clever minds in Whitehall are looking at two potential options, both of which would involve parliament giving greater authority to the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.One option would involve the Supreme Court assessing decisions by the ECJ and considering whether they breach the fundamental principles of Britain's constitutional norms that have been laid down over the centuries in various Acts of Parliament and common law. This would follow a similar path to the German constitutional court which can assess whether ECJ decisions challenge Germany's constitution.The problem with this option, of course, is that Britain does not have a single, codified constitution and so legal comparisons would be complex to say the least. And there is also the small problem that placing British constitutional traditions ahead of EU law would effectively leave the UK in breach of the many treaties it has signed over the years as a member of the European Union. If you don't sign up to the club rules, you can't be a member of the club.So a second option is being considered that some see as being perhaps more feasible. This would again involve parliament beefing up the authority of the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice. But - and here's the clever part - the Supreme Court would do this only in exceptional circumstances if it thought the judges in Luxembourg were breaching not UK law, but EU law.Crucially, the Supreme Court would not be questioning the supremacy of EU law. It would simply be ensuring that the UK obeyed the EU treaties which it had signed up to, rather than how those treaties were being interpreted by judges in Luxembourg. Now this might sound mad, or at the very least counter-intuitive. But national courts like the UK Supreme Court have already questioned what some see as the ""judicial activism"" of the European Court of Justice. Some courts think that the ECJ has on occasion exceeded its jurisdiction and made judgements that are not based on EU treaties.In a case last year, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether Home Secretary Theresa May was legally able to deprive a Vietnamese man of his UK citizenship because he was considered by the security services to be a threat to national security.The European Court of Justice has in various judgements challenged such decisions because it believes that EU citizenship is dependent on national citizenship and therefore it has a right to poke its nose in decisions like this.But the Supreme Court questioned this judicial activism which it considered was not based on any EU treaty text. In a judgement on the so-called Pham case, on 25 March 2015, the judges said in, paragraph 90:""A domestic court faces a particular dilemma if, in the face of the clear language of a Treaty and of associated declarations and decisions, such as those mentioned in paras 86-89, the Court of Justice reaches a decision which oversteps jurisdictional limits which Member States have clearly set at the European Treaty level and which are reflected domestically in their constitutional arrangements. But, unless the Court of Justice has had conferred upon it under domestic law unlimited as well as unappealable power to determine and expand the scope of European law, irrespective of what the Member States clearly agreed, a domestic court must ultimately decide for itself what is consistent with its own domestic constitutional arrangements, including in the case of the 1972 Act what jurisdictional limits exist under the European Treaties and upon the competence conferred on European institutions including the Court of Justice.""Now that might read as a lot of rather wordy legalese but it is in fact the highest court of the land very gently and very politely telling its counterpart in Luxembourg to go stick. This led the legal expert, Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, to conclude in a lecture on November 2015 that:""There is no doubt that some of the case-law of the Court of Justice has been regarded by the supreme courts of Member States as exceeding the jurisdiction conferred upon it, and in so doing encroaching in an unauthorised way upon the national legal systems. UK judges have expressed concerns of precisely this kind. In my mind they have been right to do so.""He added: ""Leaving the protection of the UK constitution to UK judges is not necessarily at odds with the UK government considering whether something further might be done in support of the role of the national judiciary. That ""something further"" might include providing statutory recognition of the limits of EU law supremacy under the European Communities Act. It is understandable that the prime minister might think that the present is an appropriate time for review of the UK constitutional position.""And Professor Wyatt is not alone. Anthony Speaight QC, who served on the government's Commission on a UK Bill of Rights, gave evidence to MPs on the All Party Group on the Rule of Law this month and he told them in a written submission:""It would do no violence to UK legal principles, and arguably would be to perfect and enhance them, if Parliament were to amend (section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972) to clarify that the domestic courts are not to enforce EU instruments and decisions if they find them to be outside EU competences, and that ECJ decisions as to whether acts are within or without competence are to be no more than persuasive authority.""Mr Speaight accepted that such a power would be ""a nuclear weapon"" that the Supreme Court would be reluctant to use. But he concluded:""It might be judged that the theoretical existence of the review in the hands of a court with so high an international reputation as the UK Supreme Court would act as a salutary warning to EU institutions to respect the limits of competence and subsidiarity.""Now this option, of beefing up the powers of the Supreme Court, is not without its problems. Some lawyers argue that there is no distinction between EU treaties and how the ECJ interprets those treaties.  The former attorney general Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One his week that the attempt was pointless because ultimately the ECJ has the final say. Some MPs think that judge-led law is just as bad coming from the UK Supreme Court as it is from the European Court. And politically there is no guarantee that a rarely-used constitutional long-stop would be enough to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU. But, right now, it appears to be the only game in town and it is the one the government is playing. "
2016-02-10,Time of discontent,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35524844,"In the great and emerging debate about whether Britain should be in or out of Europe, the ""ins"" already have their script but there is one narrative they fear.The plan of those who favour staying in the EU will be to focus on the economy, to demand from the ""outs"" what the British economy would look like outside the EU. It is a campaign that will focus heavily on risk and security. And if the polls are close in the run-up to the referendum they foresee pressure on the pound and that will only serve to underpin the warnings from some of the heavyweights in the business community that leaving the EU would be a dangerous gamble.What, almost certainly, will not determine the outcome of the referendum is the detail of the expected deal with the EU. Few will study closely ""emergency brakes"" or ""red cards"" or safeguards for British interests. How they vote will be decided by instinct, by gut, by visceral feelings about the EU.The referendum comes at a moment of voter frustration, of anger, of resentment - a new restlessness that marks the politics of Europe and the US. In Europe, there is an anti-establishment mood, a turning away from mainstream parties. And if there is one issue above all others that stokes this mood it is migration.I have heard several Tory MPs say that the referendum will not be about Europe directly but migration. Those who want to stay in the EU fear the tides of spring will bring new migrants to Europe's shores and - rightly or not - will make the outcome of the referendum harder to predict.The backdrop to this vote is the big divide of the time, two sharply differing views of the world. This is partly a caricature but it pits globalists against anti-establishment populists.This is not to say that the ins and outs fit neatly into these camps - they don't, but the referendum will be held when these currents are proving potent in European and American politics.The globalists see a gradual withering away of the nation state, weakened in the face of global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and migration.  They count themselves as internationalists who see multiculturalism as the future, a reality which cannot be undone or reversed. They tend to view their opponents as backward-looking, nostalgic, isolationists, old-fashioned nationalists some of whom they suspect are tinged with racism.On the other side, the anti-establishment populists rail against a global technocratic elite that glides between capitals seemingly answerable to no-one; career politicians acting in their own interests.

London and Scotland are exceptions, both clearly favouring continued EU membership.Full YouGov analysisIn the new age of anxiety old political ties weaken. Voters are more footloose. They give their loyalty to start-up parties and then just as quickly withdraw it. They are consumer voters drawn to the mood of the moment. This insecurity, this feeling of loss, this helplessness in the face of forces dimly understood finds much of its focus in migration. In Europe last autumn, Angela Merkel tried to frame the debate when she accepted hundreds of thousands of migrants into Germany. She said that isolation, ""sealing and cordoning yourself off in the age of the internet is an illusion"".  You cannot close the borders she said repeatedly.""What we are experiencing now,"" said the German Chancellor, ""is something that will change our continent in coming years.""  And with that word ""change"" she stirred up stronger opposition and made starker the divide. One of her conservative allies Horst Seehofer gave his response to change being unavoidable. ""That is then a different country,"" he said. ""And the people don't want Germany or Bavaria to become a different country.""Echoes of those doubts have sounded across Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe. The prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, warned of the EU committing ""ritual suicide"" by letting in so many migrants. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, said simply: ""We do not want a multicultural society."" Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front in France, defines the new politics as a fight between what she calls ""nationalists"" and ""bad globalists"".Others pick up on these insecurities. The former French President Nicholas Sarkozy, working on his comeback, directs his appeal to ""La France de toujours"" - eternal France.This anti-establishment mood finds echoes in America on both the left and the right. The middle class is financially squeezed and fearful and - in this primary season - courted by blowhards who insist that the certainties of the past can be reclaimed and that the complexities of the modern world are a failure of will and leadership.Almost every candidate runs against Washington while anti-establishment candidates in Europe resent intrusions from Brussels.In America some detect that the old political consensus lies fractured.  In his book The Unwinding, the writer George Packer says ""no-one can say when the unwinding began, when the coil that held America together in its secure and sometime shifting grip first gave way"".What links Europe and America is the powerlessness of those in power in the face of globalisation or that is how it often appears. What many voters seem to want is control and authority. So in the UK, the Out campaigns will base much of their appeal on promising to regain control of borders, of trade, of sovereignty.  In our shrinking world democratic parties have not found an answer to globalisation and that insecurity feeds into the rise of the anti-establishment parties.And that is the fear of the In campaign in the referendum - that a significant number of people will see the vote as an opportunity to snub the establishment and to vent frustration. Referendums are not always about the question asked on the paper."
2016-02-10,Can't Brussels be simpler?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35532846,"The difficulty of determining how many UK laws originate in the EU illustrates how daunting the job of reporting the EU can be for journalists. Buried statistics, convoluted decision-making, endless jargon - these were just some of the complaints raised at a London conference examining how the British media report ""Brussels"". The UK's EU debate was famously spiced up by a televised head-to-head in 2014 between UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage (Eurosceptic) and the then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (Liberal, pro-EU). They gave wildly divergent figures for the quantity of UK laws ""made in Brussels"" - Mr Farage said it was 70%, while Mr Clegg said 7%. It will be among the important issues for UK voters to consider in the run-up to the in-out referendum on EU membership. There is intense speculation that the vote - potentially a turning-point in British history - could be held on 23 June.Research by the House of Commons Library revealed how hard it was to solve the ""laws made in Brussels"" question. There are just so many types of law, adopted in different ways. Its estimate was between 15% and 50%, depending on the calculation used. Just to add to the confusion, former EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding threw in the 70% figure - but she was referring to the amount of laws which the European Parliament ""co-decides"" with EU government ministers. That's not the same as the amount that becomes UK law. For one thing, the UK has opted out of various EU laws in the areas of law and justice and governance of the eurozone. The law certainly is an issue in this referendum, because one of Prime Minister David Cameron's reform demands is for the EU to hand back more powers to national parliaments.Will Moy, director of the fact-checking organisation Full Fact, said the EU's complexity was a big challenge for journalists and researchers.""The UK has robust mechanisms for dealing with facts, but where are the equivalent bodies in the EU?"" he asked. His estimate for ""laws made in Brussels"" was 50% - a rough estimate, he stressed.Several journalists contrasted the cut-and-thrust of combative Westminster politics with the consensus-driven, committee-heavy style of Brussels politics.Not surprisingly most avoid trying to explain the EU's ""acquis"", ""comitology"" or ""Luxembourg compromise"".But the mission to explain was certainly underlined at the conference. It was organised by The UK in a Changing Europe - an initiative to bridge the gap between the EU and British voters. Mike Berry, of the Cardiff University School of Journalism, lamented the British public's ""frighteningly low"" level of understanding of the EU - and urged the media to do more explaining.""I was very lost, with the difficult jargon, and Brussels has a tendency to suppress the drama,"" said Joshua Chaffin, recalling his work as a Brussels reporter for the Financial Times. ""But you can get to enjoy the sophistication of the game. So many different interpretations are often valid at the same time,"" he said. The battle of the interpretations is already under way, as Mr Cameron well knows.

2016-02-10,Campaign battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35522695,"Campaigning for the EU referendum is effectively under way already even though we don't yet know when it will be held or what the final package of reforms to the UK's membership that David Cameron will put to the British public.Another unknown factor to add to the mix is the question of which will be the official campaigns on the In/Remain and Out/Leave sides.While a plethora of groups have been set up to argue the case for the UK to stay in or leave the EU, to quote Christopher Lambert from the cult movie Highlander, ""there can be only one"" when it comes to the official lead campaign for either side. So how does the process work?Referendums are relatively rare in British political history but when they do happen, they are governed by a series of protocols and rules enshrined in law. One of these is that a lead campaign is officially designated on each side, if it meets certain criteria. For instance, in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Better Together was chosen as the official pro-UK lead campaign while Yes Scotland was chosen as the official pro-independence lead group.The Electoral Commission, which is in charge of making sure the EU referendum is a fair contest, will make the decision. The choice is very important, not merely for the increased media profile it confers on the chosen campaigns but also for the financial benefits.The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts on TV and radio, free mail shots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000.On one side of the fence, the state of play looks relatively straightforward. Britain Stronger In Europe is the main, and as yet unchallenged, campaign group making the case for the UK's continued membership of the EU. Although the SNP and Labour have both said they will run their own separate campaigns, and there are other internal Tory groups, this umbrella body - which is chaired by former M&S chair Lord Rose - commands broad support among those who believe the UK's future lies within the EU.However, it is a very different picture among those arguing that leaving the EU will benefit Britain. At the moment, there are three rival groups who could all ultimately vie for the nod from the Electoral Commission.Six months ago, it looked like a straight fight between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. The former was spawned out of the Business for Britain group, a longstanding Eurosceptic lobby group which campaigned for the UK to overhaul its status with the EU. It has historic links with the Conservative Party - it is now chaired by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson and its campaign director is Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove. It also has experience of fighting and winning referendums. Its chief executive Matthew Elliott ran the successful No 2 AV campaign in 2011, which opposed any change to the electoral system. Its deputy chairman is Labour donor John Mills and it includes UKIP's MP, Douglas Carswell, amongst its backers.Leave.EU is a different animal altogether. It was set up last July by businessman Arron Banks, a former Conservative donor who became one of UKIP's biggest supporters in the run-up to last year's election, It has drawn most of its support from UKIP activists and portrayed itself as more of a popular movement focused on immigration.Relations between the two groups have never been cordial, amid claims of hidden agendas, differences in strategies, and failing to reach out to others in the Out camp. Amid signs that their differences were irreconcilable, a new outfit - Grassroots Out - sprung up last month and has gained support. GO was formed by Tory MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour's Kate Hoey. It has since won the backing of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and his MEPs and its events have been attended by former ministers Liam Fox and David Davis as well as members of the DUP.All of the groups concerned are making big play of their cross-party credentials and being a ""broad church"". This is not a coincidence.Any group seeking the official designation has to meet a series of criteria, set down by the watchdog. In other words, it has to pass a series of tests. One of these is demonstrating that it commands support from across the political spectrum. The other criteria are:The Electoral Commission has said it will chose ""whichever of the applicants appears...to represent to the greatest extent those campaigning for that outcome"".However, it is not as simple as that. The watchdog has the power to reject all applications to be the lead campaign on the grounds they do not meet the criteria set down in the 2000 Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act.To do this, however, would be highly unusual and controversial.Whichever Out campaign is chosen is likely to influence the tone and conduct of the campaign as well as who its figurehead is. Nigel Farage is likely to play a much more prominent role if either Leave.EU or Go is chosen - with the campaign likely to have the issues of immigration and security at its heart. Many Tory Eurosceptics - including a number of Cabinet ministers - will feel more comfortable with Vote Leave, which wants, according to UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, to have a ""broad-based, optimistic, upbeat campaign"", with a focus on what they claim will be the economic benefits of leaving the EU. Labour Eurosceptics, at the moment, seem uncertain about which horse to back, with John Mills - the founder of Labour Leave - insisting that it remains affiliated to Vote Leave despite rumours to the contrary. The watchdog has said it will publish details of the designation process once David Cameron has named the date for the referendum, which could happen as early as Monday 22 February, if a deal on his draft renegotiation package is agreed by EU leaders the previous weekend.The timing of the process will be among details set out in legislation relating to the EU poll that will have to be approved by MPs. With the prospect of the referendum itself taking place in late June, campaigners on both sides will be keen for the watchdog to make a speedy decision, potentially before the Easter holiday at the end of March.  The Scottish referendum campaigns were designated on 23 April 2014, just under five months before the referendum was held on 18 September. While the period is likely to be slightly shorter this time, activists will be arguing that time is of the essence in getting their message across.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-10,Osborne's big worry,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35523334,"Here's a starter for ten: What was Ed Balls' Fiscal Rule?Any takers?  No? At the back there, come on, you must have been paying attention.Well, the then shadow chancellor announced it in 2014.Labour, he said, would make a ""binding fiscal commitment"" to ""balance the books, deliver a surplus on the current budget and get the national debt falling in the next Parliament"".Whether this was economically literate was not really the point - it was a political offer to the public with one central message: you can trust Labour with the public finances.George Osborne's ""fiscal mandate"" is attempting something similar.The chancellor has pledged to run a surplus from 2019-20 ""in normal times"".Given that ""in normal times"" covers a whole host of possibilities - and certainly allows for a large margin of wriggle room - this again is a political rather than concrete economic offer.Now, the Treasury seems to think such offers to the public are useful in as much as they signal the same approach to the public finances - you can trust us - as Mr Balls attempted in 2014.But the fact that I'm not sure a lot of readers of this blog would have been able to answer my starter for ten at the beginning of this post reveals a deeper truth.Mr Osborne knows that he can set as many fiscal mandates as he likes, the public are unlikely to notice.What they are likely to notice is whether the economic growth they so regularly hear trumpeted by the chancellor is actually making a difference to their lives.And this is where another part of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Green Budget comes in.Yes, the threat of further tax rises and possible public sector cuts might be very real, but the chancellor's political advisors know that one of the key motivators of voting behaviour is whether people feel, and actually are, better off.And there the figures are pretty gloomy.As I pointed out last week, one of the most important points in the Bank of England's report on the state of the UK economy was that wage growth was slowing.Low inflation, immigration, the use of cheaper technological solutions and companies keener on repairing balance sheets than paying people more money have meant that the pre-financial crisis relationship between high employment levels and wage inflation (that one has a tendency to lead to the other, illustrated by the Phillips Curve) is stuttering.Last year the Bank made the confident prediction that real incomes would rise by 3.75%.That has now been downgraded to 3%.Now, of course, with inflation at 0.2% that is still an increase.But after the 2009-14 ""great pay squeeze"" which saw median incomes for all employees fall by over 9% in real terms, there is still a long way to go before economic growth releases a more confident ""feel good factor"" among the employed.Yes, consumer spending is rising, as this morning's Barclays Spend Trends report reveals.However, the fear is that the increase is being driven by increasing debt as people take advantage of ultra-low interest rates to access cheap loans.Low wage growth is an economic problem for the chancellor.As the IFS argues, lower wage growth means lower tax income which feeds the case that Mr Osborne may have to raise fresh taxes or find further cuts in public spending to meet his ""fiscal mandate"".These will only be slightly offset by the increases mandated by the National Living Wage, as much of that increase will be paid to those below the present tax threshold.Low wage growth is also a political problem.Ask most people what the fiscal mandate is and you will probably receive a pretty blank stare.Ask people if their wages are going up fast enough, and the answer will be a lot more vocal."
2016-02-10,Junior doctors row,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211051026/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35503712,"Amid all the claim and counterclaim about anti-social-hours payments, on-call duties and long working days, it's easy to get bogged down in the detail of the junior doctors dispute.But with a second strike by medics in England taking place on Wednesday, it's worth stopping for a moment to ask why this row matters.Of course, how much doctors get paid for working weekends is clearly important to them - and, as taxpayers, the rest of us. And if the quality of care at weekends improves as a result of this contract, as the government argues it will, it goes without saying that matters too.But there is another element to this dispute, which is arguably much more fundamental than either of these issues: it's about the changing nature of healthcare - and how we respond to it.Since the health service was created in the aftermath of World War Two, it has gone from a service where patients either died or were cured of their illness to one where people are surviving but having to sometimes live with debilitating conditions. It's a success story in many ways. We are now surviving heart attacks, strokes and cancer in a way that would have been unimaginable when the NHS was formed in 1948.But that has brought with it challenges. There are about 15 million people living with what are classed as chronic illnesses such as dementia, heart disease and diabetes - for which there is no cure. Many of these people are elderly and need careful support and care.15mpeople in England have a long-term health conditionBy 2025, that could be18m 70% of the NHS Budget is spent on caring for themIt has meant that hospitals are now full of incredibly sick and frail patients who would simply not have been alive 20, perhaps even 10 years ago. One in four hospital beds is occupied by dementia patients, for example.That means the lives of junior doctors are very different to what they were in previous generations. More is being asked of them in terms of dealing with large numbers of ill patients. One medic told me how at weekends she could regularly be in charge of 80 really sick patients - all of whom ideally need huge amounts of care and support. The doctors feel run ragged and undervalued.It is this that is clearly contributing to the ""high level of discontent"" in the workforce referred to by Sir David Dalton, the hospital chief executive brought in to negotiate with the British Medical Association, in his letter to ministers after the latest breakdown of talks. But this isn't just unique to junior doctors. A similar theme has emerged in general practice where last week we heard that many GPs feel they can no longer provide adequate care to their patients, while demands from care homes meant there needed to be a complete re-think of how their residents are cared for.This is because as hospitals have had to cope with more and more really sick patients, a lot of the care that was once done there has been pushed out into the community. GPs now run asthma clinics, provide diabetes care and even carry out minor operations, while dealing with patients who are living with a range of different illnesses.Now a lot of people may say, 'So what? There are lots of different jobs where people could argue more and more is being asked of them too. What makes being a doctor so special?' The simple answer - and it is one the profession puts time and time again - is that the work they do affects people in a much more profound way than other professions. What, after all, could be more fundamental than an individual's health?And so, even when this dispute is over, we will still be left with an even more intractable problem.

2016-02-11,We will fight contract imposition - BMA,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35548091,"Ministers are to impose a contract on junior doctors in England after a final offer was rejected by the British Medical Association.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had been left with no choice after the union refused to compromise.He said the final deal rejected on Wednesday was an ""important step"" in improving care at weekends.Chief negotiator Sir David Dalton had advised ministers to do ""whatever necessary"" to end the deadlock.The BMA rejected a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" deal on Wednesday, which included a concession on Saturday pay.The news has emerged as junior doctors concluded a second 24-hour strike at 08:00 GMT in their long-running dispute about pay and conditions.The contract offered by the government would have seen those working at least one in four Saturdays get extra pay for each one they work. The move represented a more generous offer than the previous proposal, when the bar for extra pay was set at one in three.The offer also included increasing fines levied against trusts for over-working doctors, and increasing the extra pay medics get for very long hours.The set of proposals was presented to the BMA on Tuesday evening, on the eve of the strike, and rejected on Wednesday afternoon when the walk-out was in full swing.During the strike doctors provided emergency cover, but the stoppage led to the cancellation of nearly 3,000 routine operations and treatments. GP care was largely unaffected.In theory, it's pretty easy. Junior doctors rotate through jobs quickly so within six months of the new contract coming into force in August 80% of medics would be on it.Between now and then hospitals will have to review their rotas and staffing requirements, before sending out offers to junior doctors in May.But the big unknown is how the British Medical Association and medical workforce will react. Behind the scenes there has been talk of more strikes, mass resignations and non-signing of the contract. Doctors have also warned of ""brain-drain"" with medics heading abroad, to other parts of the UK or into other sectors, such as the drugs industry. This, it seems, is unchartered territory - imposing a whole new contract on doctors is thought to have never been done before.The junior doctors row explainedAnalysis: Time for the nuclear option?What exactly do junior doctors do?How does your job compare?The offer was made by Sir David, the chief executive of Salford Royal Hospital, who was brought in by ministers last month to broker a deal in the bitter dispute.In his letter to the British Medical Association (BMA) on Tuesday, he said it was a final offer and that if it was rejected it would mean there is ""no realistic prospect of a negotiated agreement"".He has now advised ministers there is no more he can do in a letter sent on Thursday morning. It also says if ministers introduce a new contract they should make it as close as possible to the final offer he made on Tuesday.The letter says Sir David's stance is supported by both NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation, the key bodies with represent health managers.Speaking to the BBC, Sir David said the ""end of the road"" had been reached with negotiations.""We need to bring the matter to a close,"" he added.But in a letter to Sir David to reject the offer, the BMA stuck to its stance that any Saturday working should attract higher pay.  It also reiterated its counter proposal made previously that basic pay be increased by only about half the 11% offered by ministers to help pay for it.If imposed, the new contracts would then come into force from August. It is unclear at the moment how the BMA will respond to imposition, although their mandate allows them to call more strikes.On Thursday the union said it would not be making a statement until the health secretary had addressed the House of Commons.During the strike BMA junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said the government had ""attacked"" and ""patronised"" the profession. There are 55,000 junior doctors in England - a third of the medical workforce.""The health secretary can end this dispute, but he must put politics to one side and concentrate on agreeing a fair contract that delivers for patients,"" Dr Malawana said.Chris Ham, chief executive of the the King's Fund think tank, said no government has ever previously imposed a contract on junior doctors, and to do so would be a ""huge risk"".""As long as that public support for junior doctors remains in place, the government has an uphill struggle to persuade the public it's doing the right thing at the right time. ""Nobody argues against seven-day working. But there's a really important discussion to be had about, will the junior doctors' contract really help that - or are other things far more important? The government really is entering very dangerous territory."""

President Putin would shed no tears if Britain left the European Union. He would see Brexit as a sign of our weakness and of the weakness of European solidarity at the very moment when we need to maintain our collective strength.""Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, hit back at Mr Benn's claims.""Pro-EU campaigners cannot make a positive case for remaining in a political project that is incapable of dealing with the challenges of the 21st century,"" he said. ""Instead of accepting that we need a new relationship with the EU, they are whipping up fear about dictators and economic doom despite the fact that neither are remotely credible.

Mr Benn also used his speech to restate his position on the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear weapons, which are at odds with those of his party's leader Jeremy Corbyn.He said other nuclear powers would not throw their missiles ""in the dustbin"" if the UK unilaterally disarmed.""I think you get there by multilateral negotiation and not by unilateral action,"" he said.""If we gave ours up I don't believe for a second that any one of the other nuclear powers in the world would say 'well if you're not going to keep yours any more we'll throw ours in the dustbin'.""Labour is carrying out a review of its defence policy, including whether Trident should be renewed."
2016-02-11,Spy law 'needs significant changes',https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35544789,"Home Secretary Theresa May's internet monitoring plans need ""significant work"", a committee has ruled.The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will force internet service providers to store all web activity for a year.It will also authorise the bulk collection of personal data and hacking of smartphones by Britain's spies.Ministers say the changes will help to catch terrorists and tackle organised crime by updating laws to fit the new technology being used by criminals.But civil liberties campaigners claim the measures contained in it amount to mass surveillance of UK citizens - and that the committee's report meant the home secretary needed to go ""back to the drawing board"".Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: ""This report shows just how much homework the government has to do on this landmark legislation.""Labour's shadow home secretary Andy Burnham has written to Mrs May to say that while Labour supports the overall aim of the bill - to give police and security services the powers they need - the government must now take time to reconsider its plans to ensure they strike ""the right balance for our security and privacy"".Mrs May said the government would ""carefully consider"" the conclusions of three committees which have reported on the Bill before presenting its final proposals.""This is vital legislation, and we are absolutely determined to get it right.""Our draft Bill followed three independent reports on investigatory powers, whose authors were unanimous a new law was necessary.""We are clear we need to introduce legislation which responds to the threats we face in the digital age, protects both the privacy and security of the public, and provides world-leading oversight and safeguards.""Everyone agrees a new law governing surveillance powers is required but the devil is in the detail, as a series of parliamentary reports have illustrated. The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year.Read more from Gordon.The Joint Committee on the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill said in a 194 page report it was satisfied the value of so-called Internet Connection Records to law enforcement agencies ""could outweigh the intrusiveness involved in collecting and using them"".But it echoed concerns from tech firms about the feasibility of protecting users' privacy in the way Mrs May has promised, by only collecting the names of websites visited, rather than individual web pages.The committee was told this might not be technically possible, but it said the Home Office was working with the industry to find a solution.Ministers must also spell out their plans on encryption to ensure that they will not force tech firms to provide a ""back door"" for spies, the parliamentary committee said.And the Home Office must also provide greater justification for the sweeping up of emails and other internet traffic passing through the UK by the security services, as revealed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, and other so-called ""bulk"" data gathering exercises.Committee chairman Lord Murphy of Torfaen said the Home Office had a ""significant amount of further work to do before Parliament can be confident that the provisions have been fully thought through"".The bill was criticised as ""a dragnet approach"" and ""disproportionate"" by former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who blocked Mrs May's previous attempt to pass spying legislation, dubbed the ""snooper's charter"" by critics, when he was in government.The Lib Dem MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Home Office wanted to ""collect everything on everyone"" in order to find the information on suspected terrorists or criminals they are looking for.""Implying that everyone may be guilty when millions of innocent people are just going about their everyday business free of any wrongdoing at all is... something which is not in keeping with long-standing British traditions,"" Mr Clegg said.He asked if it was ""proportionate in a liberal democracy to retain information on everything from the music you download on Spotify, to the app that you open, to the supermarket website that you visit, in order to go after the bad guys?""He said he favoured a ""narrower approach"" to data retention, and that other countries concentrate on collecting data on those people who ""flicker on the radar screen of security services in the first place.""Much of the vast bill is devoted to the activities of Britain's intelligence agencies, and is focused on making clear the legal basis under which they operate, following Edward Snowden's revelations.It proposes ""equipment interference"" warrants, allowing spies to hack into suspects' smartphones and computers and download data from them. either within the UK or abroad.Other warrants will cover the downloading of ""bulk"" databases of personal data, which could include medical records, and the sweeping up internet traffic passing through the UK for future analysis by GCHQ.Some of these techniques were not known to the public until recently and were covered by disparate and obscure pieces of legislation, some of which predated the internet.The draft bill also proposes:"
2016-02-11,Google defends UK tax arrangements,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35550487,"Google's UK chief has defended the search giant's tax arrangements in a hearing before MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee.Matt Brittin said he understood public anger about the amount of tax it paid.However, he said Google was paying 20% tax on its UK profits, not the 3% figure cited in some reports.The £130m in UK tax it paid for the 10 years from 2005 was reached following a ""six-year rigorous, independent tax audit"" by HMRC, Mr Brittin said.Tom Hutchinson, Google's global tax chief, told MPs that the company did not negotiate its tax settlement with HMRC. He told the committee that the tax authorities did not ""throw out a number - it's not a negotiation"", adding: ""There was no top-line figure; that's not how the process works.""The £130m payment included £18m in interest, Mr Hutchinson told MPs, but no penalties or payments under the government's diverted profits tax - also known as the ""Google tax"".Today's Public Accounts Committee hearing was interesting less for Google's explanation of its tax arrangements - we've heard much of that detail before - and more for HMRC's defence of the settlement.There Dame Lin Homer, the head of HMRC, made two significant points.First, she said that under the law HMRC could not have demanded more from Google, pointing out that the £130m settlement was the largest the technology giant had signed outside the US.Dame Lin said it would not have helped if HMRC had gone to court.Certainly, proving that the company had acted ""unreasonably"" is difficult.Second, Dame Lin said that HMRC applied the same tax laws to Google as it did to any business and that at any one time up to two-thirds of large businesses are under-going some form of tax audit process.HMRC says it is constrained by the complicated tax laws. If they are to change, it is politicians who need to act.MPs also questioned HMRC officials about their settlement with Google. Jim Harra, its head of business taxation, said the company was not fined, despite underpaying tax, because proving ""insufficient care"" was ""very difficult"".Dame Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, admitted that the six-year investigation into Google's tax affairs took a long time to complete, but said that similar inquiries into far smaller firms could be just as lengthy. Mr Brittin said there had been no co-ordination with the Treasury about the timing of Google's announcement about the tax settlement late last month. The Chancellor, George Osborne, described it as a victory for the government. The timing was determined by the fact that the figure was due to be made public when the company's UK accounts were filed, Mr Brittin said.Dame Lin told MPs that HMRC informed the relevant minister that a big company was to make a tax announcement the following day, but did not name the firm.""What we don't, and never, do is share taxpayer information with ministers and Treasury colleagues,"" she said.In a statement released after the hearing, Google said that it had 2,329 staff in the UK last year compared with 156 in 2005.In an article for the Telegraph published on Thursday, Mr Brittin said Google wanted the international tax system to be reformed. He said the company paid $3.3bn in corporation tax last year, mostly in the US, where most of Google's products were designed and created.""We have long been in favour of simpler, clearer rules, because it is important not only to pay the right amount of tax, but to be seen to be paying the right amount,"" Mr Brittin wrote. ""But changes to the tax system are not Google's call. Reform must come from governments, not from the companies who are subject to their rules.""He was asked four times by Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, how much he was paid. Mr Brittin said: ""I don't have the figure, but I will happily provide it.""""You don't know what you get paid?"" responded Ms Hillier.""Out there, taxpayers, our constituents, are very angry, they live in a different world clearly to the world you live in, if you can't even tell us what you are paid."""
2016-02-11,English votes system 'unstable' say MPs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543870,"The new system of ""English Votes for English Laws"" is overly complicated and may not last long, MPs have warned.The Public Administration Select Committee said the arrangement could end up as a ""short term experiment"" due to levels of opposition in the Commons.Legislation deemed to affect England, or England and Wales only, is now subject to an extra stage of scrutiny, involving only MPs elected there.Ministers said it was an ""important balance"" to devolution elsewhere. The rules, introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland, were activated in the House of Commons for the first time last month.English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies, as part of a new stage in the legislative process for considering bills applying only to their constituents. In a report on the new system, the cross-party committee of MPs said there was ""strong English demand"" for measures to address the ""constitutional anomalies"" that devolution had brought.But it said the new provisions were ""ad hoc"", lacked transparency and appeared incompatible with the 40-year old Barnett Formula for distributing funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.""The new standing orders do require further consideration and evaluation if they are to be anything more than a short-term experiment in the House's internal procedure,"" the MPs said.""That former clerks of the House of Commons - individuals steeped in decades of learning about Parliamentary procedure - should have difficulty in discerning what these standing orders mean should raise serious further doubts about how sustainable they are.""The report said the test for whether legislation applied only to England, which is determined by the Commons Speaker, was not ""very simple"" and risked putting the Speaker in an ""unnecessarily controversial position"".The extent of the opposition to the system, which has united Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist Party, ""underlined their vulnerability"", the committee said.The SNP has said the changes are ""driving Scotland out of the door"".""With only the Conservative Party in favour of the new arrangements, these standing orders face a high risk of being overridden as soon as there is a non-Conservative majority in the House of Commons,"" it said. ""That the standing orders have attracted such hostility and can be removed on the basis of a simple majority must raise doubts as to whether they can ever be more than a temporary expedient, and currently they cannot be considered to be part of a stable constitutional settlement that will endure.""Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said the new system had little cross-party support and urged ministers to come back with ""more comprehensible proposals"" during a review later this year. A government spokesman said: ""The government is committed to a stronger Union and a fair settlement for the whole of the United Kingdom, and English votes for English laws brings an important balance to the unprecedented powers that have been devolved to other parts of the country.""We will be reviewing the operation of the standing orders later this year, drawing upon the work of both the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the House of Commons Procedure Committee."""

2016-02-11,Early guilty pleas 'to be encouraged',https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35539185,"New sentencing guidelines intended to encourage earlier guilty pleas are to be consulted on in England and Wales. The Sentencing Council says a sentence reduction of a third must only be given to those who plead guilty the first time they enter a plea. Currently, defendants must plead at first ""reasonable opportunity"". It said the proposals would spare more victims the trauma of a trial.The Ministry of Justice said no decisions had been made.Currently defendants can have their sentence reduced by up to a third if they plead guilty at the ""first reasonable opportunity"", which has been open to interpretation by different judges.Under the new proposals, they will have to plead guilty the first time they are asked for their plea in court to receive this reduction. The maximum reduction for those who admit guilt after this would also be reduced from 25% to 20%. Under the new draft guidelines, the sliding scale for sentencing reductions would be:No reduction in sentence would be offered to someone pleading guilty to murder where the judge determines they should receive a whole life jail term.The requirement that courts should take into account a guilty plea in deciding what sentence an offender should get is a long-standing principle set out in law by Parliament. The council said the new guidelines provided ""a much tighter framework"" and ""much less scope for offenders to 'play the system' and still receive the maximum discount"".""There is an understandable reluctance to provide those who are guilty with a 'reward' for pleading guilty, especially when they have little or no prospect of being acquitted,"" it said.""However, it is important to recognise that the guilty plea reduction is in place to provide an incentive and not a reward.""For it to work effectively, it is important that it is a clear and unqualified incentive to the defendant.""BBC legal correspondent Clive ColemanNot everyone agrees that reducing sentences for those who plead guilty is a good thing, but the law builds this discount of sentences into the criminal justice system. The reasons are straightforward.  Guilty pleas spare victims and witnesses the stress of a trial, and free up police, prosecutors and courts for other cases.  They also save public money.  The significant change in today's proposal is the creation of a greater incentive for defendants to plead guilty at the first court hearing. The current maximum one third reduction in sentence stays for those who plead at that point.  But the reduction in sentence is lowered if someone pleads guilty later on in the process. For those who plead after that first stage the maximum reduction will be 20%, down from the current 25%.  Reductions continue to drop the closer to the trial date the plea is entered. The great prize is efficiency and certainty.  Removing cases at an early stage means they don't gum up the system and affect timetabling.  This gives victims and witnesses in contested cases clarity and a far higher degree of certainty as to when their case will be heard.  Chairman Lord Justice Treacy said: ""We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible.""When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify.""It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases.""The council stressed that nothing in the new guidelines ""should be taken to suggest that an accused person who is not guilty of an offence should be pressured to plead guilty"".Mark Fenhalls QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said ""clarity and consistency"" in sentencing was welcome, but flexibility was also vital.""There has to be a proper balance between the interests of the public, victims and the rights of defendants to fair process, without undue pressure being placed on defendants who are often vulnerable.  ""Defendants who plead guilty early must always receive more credit than those who game the system. But guidelines must not become straitjackets that prevent judges from making the right decision in individual cases.""A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""The changes in the consultation would lead to stricter sentences as those pleading guilty later in the process will get a smaller reduction. ""There would be no change to the reduction for those pleading guilty at the earliest point in the process.""Following the spending review, there is no financial need to cut prison numbers over the next five years. Protecting the public will always be our top priority.""The Sentencing Council was set up by Parliament to promote consistency in sentencing while maintaining the independence of the judiciary.It recommends sentences according to the relative seriousness of different offences, and the seriousness of the offender's behaviour relative to that of others convicted of the same crime."

Responding to Mr Clark's statement, Mr Reed said Surrey was the council receiving the largest slice of a £300m hardship fund to ameliorate the impact of spending cuts, adding mistakenly that this ""is where the secretary of state just happens to be an MP"".Mr Reed corrected himself following prompting by Conservative MPs. Reflecting on the error afterwards, Mr Reed said it was one of those things that occasionally happened. ""I wrongly said it was in Surrey. It is in Kent. I know it is in Kent. I have been down there before. I just got that one wrong, I'm afraid.""The MP for Croydon North, who grew up in Hertfordshire before moving to south London, said he did not believe the comments were symbolic of Labour's problems to make headway in the south of England, outside of London. ""I go camping and on day trips around the south of England. My family all live there. I love the area and feel part of it. Every now and then you make a slip.""MPs approved the government's plans for 2016 to 2020 by 315 votes to 209 despite opposition claims that proposed spending cuts of more than 6% a year would ""rip the heart out of communities"" and that Tory councils have been prioritised for ""transitional help"" ahead of May's elections.

""It is understood by all that UKIP in Wales is operated on the basis of mutual respect and understanding,"" the petition states.""In light of the extraordinary circumstances prevailing and indeed, as a last resort, to prevent further harm and disharmony within 'the party' it is necessary to censure and remove those responsible forthwith.""The petition accused Mr Gill of showing ""a lack of leadership in all aspects pertaining to this matter"".It said that ""through his inactivity or unwillingness to resolve the prevailing circumstances, [he] has exacerbated the situation to the point where members no longer have faith in his ability to lead UKIP in Wales in any effective way"".UKIP general election candidates backing the petition were Joe Smyth (Islwyn), Darran Thomas (Brecon and Radnorshire), Ken Beswick (Torfaen), Blair Smillie (Alyn and Deeside), Nigel Williams (Delyn), and Paul Davies Cooke (Vale of Clwyd).Mr Williams, one of the petition organisers, said it was ""better late than never"" to raise their concerns with the assembly election so close.He called for a leadership election, saying UKIP Wales could choose ""any one from ten great people"".However, Gethin James, a UKIP councillor and assembly election candidate for Ceredigion, told BBC Radio Cymru: ""It's not a good situation, but I'm one hundred percent behind Nathan Gill.

But Mr Tusk has indicated the size of the task still ahead by clearing his diary to focus solely on high-level talks. He tweeted: ""Talks on UK in EU settlement a fragile political process. I cancelled all my obligations to meet EU leaders & EP to secure broad support.""Mr Cameron has been touring European capitals to try to address reservations about the package of changes he is seeking, which include limits on the payment of in-work benefits to new EU migrants, and new protections for countries outside the eurozone. Denmark is among the countries to have said they back the proposals in full but Poland has said the welfare changes need further discussion and France is reported to be unhappy about anything that would give non-eurozone countries a veto over issues affecting the entire EU. Draft conclusions of the summit, released on Tuesday, gave no indication of whether an agreement would be reached but stressed that, if it was, it would be legally-binding and compatible with existing EU treaties.Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said he believes the government has the basis of a deal over its proposed emergency brake on in-work benefits.This would see newly arrived EU migrants receive tax credits at a reduced rate during their first four years in the country as long as the UK could demonstrate its welfare system was under excessive strain. Mr Hammond told MPs that ""those countries who were expected to have been critical were impressed with the way the council has found a solution which addresses the UK's needs without trampling roughshod over their cherished principles. ""I think we've got something here which is workable,"" he added. ""There is some refinement still to do and the discussion is still underway but I think we have got the basis of a workable deal in this section."" Campaigners calling for the UK to leave the EU have dismissed the negotiation process as a ""sham"" and say it will have little impact on the UK's sovereignty and ability to control its own borders. Speaking at a rally in London, attended by Conservative, Labour, UKIP and DUP politicians, Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said proponents of EU exit were offering ""something better than the EU - an independent, prosperous and global Britain"". He urged 'Out' campaigners to extol the economic benefits of leaving the EU, which he said would lead to lower energy and food prices and a better deal for British farmers free of the Common Agricultural Policy.

2016-02-11,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-11,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-11,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-11,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-11,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-11,'Unity reshuffle?',https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35545830,"They'll laugh it off for now, as governments always do. But as the prime minister enters this last week of negotiation before the crunch EU summit in Brussels next week, ministers' minds are turning to what happens in the aftermath, not just of the summit, but the referendum itself. And while Number 10 won't countenance any discussion of moves for its top team, several sources have told me that a reshuffle following a theoretical government victory in the referendum is very much on the cards. One source told me a ""unity reshuffle"" is being planned, to pull the party back together after the campaign to show that the Conservatives had a debate about Europe, and it was not a disaster. One senior minister told me ""there is bound to be"" a reorganisation, and maybe quite a big one, of the senior team. And it could be David Cameron's most wide-ranging reshuffle ever. He has never been fond of moving ministers around - reshuffles are notoriously hard to get right - and he's believed it makes sense to allow ministers time to master their brief, well at least not be shoved out at the first sign of trouble. Even after the general election, he left his senior team relatively intact. But after a very unusual permitted period of disagreement during the referendum campaign, a reshuffle where Eurosceptics are embraced, even promoted, could be used to show that the government can move forward as a team. A senior minister said there will be an ""overarching need to bring the party together to govern"". There are many moving parts to all of this. It's not even clear yet which ministers will declare for the Eurosceptic cause, although you'd get a decent bet on Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, Theresa Villiers, John Whittingdale, Michael Gove and still possibly Sajid Javid. And then there's even Mayor of London Boris Johnson. And of course it is not at all certain that the pro EU side of the argument will win the referendum. If David Cameron loses, all bets are off, and his job might even be on the line. But if he wins, and this reshuffle comes to pass, who might go where? Well, there would likely be a senior job for Boris Johnson, maybe as home secretary or even defence secretary with a move in turn, for Theresa May, perhaps to the Foreign Office. Mr Johnson turned down a Cabinet job after the general election, but the prime minister has promised there will be another offer. Michael Fallon, the current defence secretary, could replace Chris Grayling as leader of the House of Commons. It's likely too that there would be another senior woman promoted into the Cabinet, perhaps Anna Soubry or Priti Patel. None of this, of course, is certain. Politics is in a strangely febrile place, and it would be foolhardy to predict much about the next few months with much conviction. Downing Street sources say it's nonsense to suggest they are putting time and energy into planning a reshuffle. The focus is all on the renegotiation, then winning the referendum. Yet as ministers make their minds up which side to take in the campaign, don't doubt that their futures after the public vote are just as much of a preoccupation as the principles of stay or go. "

2016-02-11,Labour's bomb,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35371074,"Clement Attlee is revered on the left as the father of the NHS and the welfare state. What is less celebrated, but no less true, is his role as the father of Britain's nuclear bomb.It was Attlee, as Labour's post-war prime minister, who made sure Britain got its own ""nuclear deterrent"", committing millions to its development at a time when the country was technically bankrupt.He did it in secret, without a debate in Parliament or the Labour Party, partly out of a desire to avoid damaging rows. The rows would come soon enough - and are continuing to split the party more than 70 years later, as Jeremy Corbyn wrestles with the seemingly impossible task of reconciling its pro and anti-nuclear factions.Attlee had his reasons for wanting Britain to become a nuclear-armed nation. He had just been elected prime minister when America dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in August 1945. He realised in an instant that the air raid wardens and fire engines that had fought to limit the damage done by Nazi bombs, were now useless in the face of the awesome destructive power of this new weapon. The only way to protect the population, he reasoned, was to have the ability to fight back.""The answer to an atomic bomb on London is an atomic bomb on another great city,"" he wrote in a secret memo to a cabinet committee 22 days after Hiroshima.This is the concept of a nuclear deterrent and ""mutually assured destruction"" in embryo.But Attlee was no warmonger. He wanted to rid the world of the menace of nuclear war by handing control of the weapons to the United Nations, even arguing that information about the bomb should be shared with the Soviet Union.""He immediately recognised the potential importance of nuclear weapons both for the conduct of war and for the conduct of international relations,"" wrote Len Scott, former professor of international history at Aberystwyth University in an essay on Labour and the bomb.But at the same time, added Prof Scott, he believed that Britain must have its own bomb, a need that became more pressing when the Americans passed a law, in August 1946, preventing it from sharing atomic secrets with other nations, including its closest wartime allies Britain and Canada, whose scientists had worked alongside the Americans to develop the Hiroshima bomb at Los Alamos.Debate raged in cabinet committees between those, like Chancellor Hugh Dalton, who argued that Britain could not afford a bomb, or the new V-force aircraft needed to deliver it, and those who argued that the country needed to keep its place at the top table and avoid being humiliated by the Americans.""We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs,"" foreign secretary, and former trade union leader, Ernest Bevin, is reported to have told one committee. ""We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.""A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacementIs there such a thing as a nuclear button?How important is Trident to the UK's security and international standing?Bevin's national prestige argument won the day - and it would surface again in 1957, when left-winger Aneurin Bevan surprised supporters by hitting back at calls for Britain to get rid of it nuclear weapons by telling that year's party conference the unilateralists were gripped by an ""an emotional spasm"" that would send a future Labour foreign secretary ""naked into the conference chamber"". Labour's leadership argued at the time that Britain should only abandon its weapons if it could persuade other countries, such as China and France, to do likewise (persuading the Soviet Union and the US to disarm was seen as a non-starter).But the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), formed in 1957, was growing in influence within the party, making the argument on moral grounds against weapons of mass destruction, with the Hydrogen bomb, a vastly more powerful weapon, recently tested by Britain, looming over the debate.CND's calls for Britain to unilaterally scrap its weapons briefly became party policy, before being overturned at the 1961 conference.Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson fought the 1964 general election questioning Britain's nuclear deterrent, declaring in Labour's manifesto that Polaris, American nuclear weapons to be fitted to British-built submarines under an agreement brokered by Tory PM Harold Macmillan, ""will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter"".  Attlee was even wheeled out, in a party election broadcast, to denounce the independent deterrent as a ""nonsense"".But the manifesto did not include an explicit commitment to abandon Polaris, just reassess the deal with the Americans, and although Wilson reduced the number of submarines from five to four, and brokered a non-proliferation treaty, Polaris became operational in 1968, beginning the round-the-clock patrols that continue to this day.The left felt betrayed by Wilson and when Labour unexpectedly went into opposition after the 1970 general election the party renewed its commitment to scrap Polaris and end moves towards a new generation of nuclear weapons, neither of which it did when it returned to power in 1974.When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979, the nuclear issue erupted with renewed ferocity in the Labour Party, against a backdrop of escalating tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union.It had now become a hugely symbolic issue for the party, a key dividing line between the left and right, who would eventually break away to form their own party, the SDP, to fight the 1983 general election. Then Labour leader Michael Foot, a founder member of CND, was a unilateralist, who also vowed to remove US nuclear weapons from British soil. His successor Neil Kinnock, was also a unilateralist, although he would drop the policy after losing the 1987 election, arguing that the best way to achieve a nuclear-free world was through negotiation between nuclear-armed nations.Kinnock had united the party behind scrapping nuclear weapons by arguing that the money spent on Trident - the replacement for Polaris - should go towards bolstering Britain's conventional forces instead, but he still faced accusations from the Conservatives that he was ""soft"" on defence and would make Britain a target for Soviet invasion. There were also questions about how Labour could scrap its weapons on moral grounds yet still expect to shelter under America's ""nuclear umbrella"" and how it could remain a member of nuclear-armed NATO.Tony Blair banished unilateralism from New Labour's vocabulary, along with other policies thought to be harming its credibility with centre ground voters. But the nuclear issue still had the power to split the party - in 2006 he faced his biggest rebellion since the Iraq war over plans to push ahead with a replacement for Trident, when 88 Labour MPs voted against the government. The backing of the Conservatives ensured Blair  won the vote convincingly. His argument to MPs was that Trident was the ""ultimate insurance"" and that it would be ""unwise and dangerous"" for Britain to unilaterally give up its nuclear capability.One of the rebels who spoke against Blair that night was veteran backbencher and CND stalwart Jeremy Corbyn, who quoted the mayor of Hiroshima in his speech, who had ""pleaded"" with Britain not to ""develop a new generation of nuclear missiles"".""We face an important decision tonight,"" said the Islington North MP. ""Either we endorse this vast expenditure, or we encourage a public debate that I believe will come down on the side of sanity, sense and peace in the world, and we do not go ahead with this vast expenditure that can lead only to a more dangerous world.""The idea that Corbyn would one day succeed Blair as Labour leader, and re-open the party's debate about unilateral disarmament, would have seemed pretty far-fetched to the MPs in the Commons chamber that night, including Corbyn himself. But he has now has the chance he has long craved to persuade the public of the ""sanity"" of his case.Labour has tended to be gripped by internal rows about scrapping nuclear weapons when it has been in opposition for some years, only to maintain the deterrent when it returns to power.But, as the party's resurgent unilateralists point out, this is the first time Labour has seriously debated the issue in a post-Cold War context. It is a very different world to the one facing Attlee in 1945.The challenge for Labour's defence review, headed by Emily Thornberry, is to avoid the Cold War thinking that still tends dominates both sides of the debate and see the issue with fresh eyes.Given the party's tortured history, that will not be easy."
2016-02-11,Spy bill analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35553408,"Everyone agrees a new law governing surveillance powers is required but the devil is in the detail, as a series of parliamentary reports have illustrated. The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.The Joint Parliamentary Committee makes 86 recommendations overall but the central thrust is that while the direction of the draft bill is broadly correct, the government still needs to make significant changes, particularly in making a number of provisions clearer.The bill aims to takes powers which were previously exercised using often obscure legal provisions and put them onto a clearer footing. But one of the most controversial provisions is a new power - to compel companies to keep Internet Connection Records (ICRs) for 12 months which detail the sites everyone visits on the web (although not what exact page). Not enough has been done to explain what is involved, the committee says. Law enforcement rather than spies are the chief sponsors of this provision and the committee gives them support for the overall concept (even adding that they could be expanded to identify people visiting websites which hold illegal material rather than just for identifying forms of communication). However, it says that more needs to be done on the detail. In particular there are problems over defining ICRs, over the technical feasibility of their collection and storage as well as the costs involved. All of this may make it challenging to deliver them in the timescale envisaged. Bulk Personal Datasets are another area of concern. Clear justifications and operational cases for why the powers are required remain lacking, the committee says, also criticising government for being unwilling to provide much detail of what kinds of datasets would be involved.Some might be obvious such as passport records but others - like health records - would be far more sensitive. It is notable in the report that the committee tried to get an answer on whether records such as health data would be excluded but was not given one by government.There is relatively little detail on the issue of encryption which has been of concern to many companies (notably Apple which submitted detailed evidence).A report from the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns from industry about the potential impact of ambiguity in some provisions. The indications are that the government wants to retain its right to seek unencrypted data even if it knows it may not always be possible to obtain it.  There are still some concerns from industry over what is meant when its said that companies need to take ""practicable"" steps to provide such data and what impact it has on end-to-end encryption systems. Some companies also remain concerned they could be compelled to hack into their own products under equipment interference provisions.The Joint Committee also calls for some significant changes to the way in which judges provide oversight over powers to increase independence. On intelligence sharing, the Joint Committee also notably calls for it to be made illegal to get another country to spy on behalf of a UK agency or body when it does not have the authorisation to collect such information. The legislation is often technical by necessity and so a lot of weight is placed on ""codes of practice"" which outline how exactly the powers should be used. The committee say these should be published along with the bill to provide greater transparency and clarity.The Intelligence and Security Committee report earlier in the week focused more narrowly on intelligence agency powers but took a tougher line. It criticised the lack of an over-arching privacy protection and also said that when challenged about what the power of bulk equipment interference actually involved, officials were unable to provide an answer. The committee have rejected the idea of a sunset clause in which the powers would expire after five years instead calling for a joint committee to review the use of the powers as the five year point approached.There were clearly differences of opinion within the committee and despite the huge amount of evidence it took, some still feel it may have had to rush. One member, Lord Strasburger argued the government had not learnt the lesson of drafting a bill too broadly and said that essential information was missing that parliament needed in order to decide if the powers were necessary and proportionate. The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year."
2016-02-11,One small step,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35548160,"Could your interactions with the government be, how can I put this, a little smoother? Mine certainly could. I paid my self-assessment tax the other day - it was a clunky business, HMRC did not send me a reminder, and there wasn't even a thank-you afterwards. A car tax reminder did arrive this week - but in the post. An email or a text with a link to where I could pay would have been far better.Well now the Government Digital Service thinks it has the answer. Later today it will unveil two new services, Notify and Pay, designed to make dealing with the government a little bit more like our relationships with online retailers.Notify is a service which will allow departments across government to keep in touch with citizens using their services via email, text or even a letter. You might think they already did that - and some do - but there is a piecemeal approach. The idea is that Notify is a platform which any civil servant can plug into and use to improve the way a service communicates, without spending much money on doing that.Gov.uk's other initiative is Pay, a system to enable government departments to receive payments or to make refunds. Again, at first sight you wonder why it's needed as the government seems perfectly capable of extracting money from us. But the idea is both to make payments more efficient across all services and to make sure that, as new ways of paying enter the market, government can quickly offer them. So for instance, if one day ministers decided that Bitcoin was an acceptable form of payment, then all services using Gov.UK Pay would be able to adopt it without any fuss or expense.Now, while this may be sold as a great benefit for anyone who has dealings with government, the main aim of these two initiatives is to save money. I had imagined that the Pay service would produce the bigger cut in costs, but actually it's Notify, scheduled to reduce spending by £600m over the next five years, compared with the £200m saving from more efficient payments.That is because a face-to-face interaction with government is estimated to cost £8.62, while a phone call costs £2.83 and a web message just 15p. So keeping in touch with your customers via email or text rather than having them drop in or phone up is good business.Government Digital Services (GDS), which is behind these developments, is the same team which brought all government websites together under the banner of Gov.UK, and won awards in the process. Its members are now almost messianic about their digital mission which they describe as ""government as a platform"".But they also realise they have a job to do in explaining why the rest of Whitehall should sign up to this quest and why we the taxpayers should care. ""It's not sexy, it's boring stuff done well,"" explained Pete Herlihy, who leads the team which has developed the Notify service.The GDS offices, where the uniform is a distinctly un-civil service T-shirts and jeans, are full of young developers who are recent and perhaps temporary arrivals in government jobs. One senses there may be a cultural chasm between them and the career civil servants who are being told to heed their digital message.Not everything has gone smoothly, with the farm payments fiasco a classic example of that cultural chasm in action. The GDS was criticised by the National Audit Office for failing to give enough support to Defra as it tried to introduce a ""digital first"" service for farmers.The NAO report said ""support was reported to be patchy and with limited continuity in personnel"".Another new GDS service, the identity assurance scheme Verify, was not ready for use by farmers so they had ended up using the existing methods - the telephone and face-to-face meetings.There have also been some notable departures from GDS over recent months including their inspirational leader Mike Bracken. Despite that, the people I met when I went to find out about the Notify and Pay still seemed excited and motivated by their mission to inject some digital innovation into public services.Reinventing government for the digital era is a daunting but vital task. Unlike Estonia, often seen as the leading digital government, we have a civil service with long traditions, wedded to processes which still - sort of - work. The challenge for the revolutionaries at the Government Digital Service is to usher Whitehall down the digital road as rapidly as possible without too many accidents along the way."
2016-02-11,Sovereign strategies,https://web.archive.org//web/20160211235826/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35539860,"Governments rarely perform miracles but they do try to square circles. And that is what David Cameron's ministers are attempting right now with Britain's constitution.They are looking for a way of asserting the sovereignty and authority of parliament over the EU in a way that convinces voters - and Boris Johnson - that Britain's relationship with the continent is changing.But they need to do this without claiming that UK law has primacy over EU law, something that would be tantamount to leaving the EU. As you might imagine, this is not proving an easy piece of constitutional carpentry.Clever minds in Whitehall are looking at two potential options, both of which would involve parliament giving greater authority to the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.One option would involve the Supreme Court assessing decisions by the ECJ and considering whether they breach the fundamental principles of Britain's constitutional norms that have been laid down over the centuries in various Acts of Parliament and common law. This would follow a similar path to the German constitutional court which can assess whether ECJ decisions challenge Germany's constitution.The problem with this option, of course, is that Britain does not have a single, codified constitution and so legal comparisons would be complex to say the least. And there is also the small problem that placing British constitutional traditions ahead of EU law would effectively leave the UK in breach of the many treaties it has signed over the years as a member of the European Union. If you don't sign up to the club rules, you can't be a member of the club.So a second option is being considered that some see as being perhaps more feasible. This would again involve parliament beefing up the authority of the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice. But - and here's the clever part - the Supreme Court would do this only in exceptional circumstances if it thought the judges in Luxembourg were breaching not UK law, but EU law.Crucially, the Supreme Court would not be questioning the supremacy of EU law. It would simply be ensuring that the UK obeyed the EU treaties which it had signed up to, rather than how those treaties were being interpreted by judges in Luxembourg. Now this might sound mad, or at the very least counter-intuitive. But national courts like the UK Supreme Court have already questioned what some see as the ""judicial activism"" of the European Court of Justice. Some courts think that the ECJ has on occasion exceeded its jurisdiction and made judgements that are not based on EU treaties.In a case last year, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether Home Secretary Theresa May was legally able to deprive a Vietnamese man of his UK citizenship because he was considered by the security services to be a threat to national security.The European Court of Justice has in various judgements challenged such decisions because it believes that EU citizenship is dependent on national citizenship and therefore it has a right to poke its nose in decisions like this.But the Supreme Court questioned this judicial activism which it considered was not based on any EU treaty text. In a judgement on the so-called Pham case, on 25 March 2015, the judges said in, paragraph 90:""A domestic court faces a particular dilemma if, in the face of the clear language of a Treaty and of associated declarations and decisions, such as those mentioned in paras 86-89, the Court of Justice reaches a decision which oversteps jurisdictional limits which Member States have clearly set at the European Treaty level and which are reflected domestically in their constitutional arrangements. But, unless the Court of Justice has had conferred upon it under domestic law unlimited as well as unappealable power to determine and expand the scope of European law, irrespective of what the Member States clearly agreed, a domestic court must ultimately decide for itself what is consistent with its own domestic constitutional arrangements, including in the case of the 1972 Act what jurisdictional limits exist under the European Treaties and upon the competence conferred on European institutions including the Court of Justice.""Now that might read as a lot of rather wordy legalese but it is in fact the highest court of the land very gently and very politely telling its counterpart in Luxembourg to go stick. This led the legal expert, Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, to conclude in a lecture on November 2015 that:""There is no doubt that some of the case-law of the Court of Justice has been regarded by the supreme courts of Member States as exceeding the jurisdiction conferred upon it, and in so doing encroaching in an unauthorised way upon the national legal systems. UK judges have expressed concerns of precisely this kind. In my mind they have been right to do so.""He added: ""Leaving the protection of the UK constitution to UK judges is not necessarily at odds with the UK government considering whether something further might be done in support of the role of the national judiciary. That ""something further"" might include providing statutory recognition of the limits of EU law supremacy under the European Communities Act. It is understandable that the prime minister might think that the present is an appropriate time for review of the UK constitutional position.""And Professor Wyatt is not alone. Anthony Speaight QC, who served on the government's Commission on a UK Bill of Rights, gave evidence to MPs on the All Party Group on the Rule of Law this month and he told them in a written submission:""It would do no violence to UK legal principles, and arguably would be to perfect and enhance them, if Parliament were to amend (section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972) to clarify that the domestic courts are not to enforce EU instruments and decisions if they find them to be outside EU competences, and that ECJ decisions as to whether acts are within or without competence are to be no more than persuasive authority.""Mr Speaight accepted that such a power would be ""a nuclear weapon"" that the Supreme Court would be reluctant to use. But he concluded:""It might be judged that the theoretical existence of the review in the hands of a court with so high an international reputation as the UK Supreme Court would act as a salutary warning to EU institutions to respect the limits of competence and subsidiarity.""Now this option, of beefing up the powers of the Supreme Court, is not without its problems. Some lawyers argue that there is no distinction between EU treaties and how the ECJ interprets those treaties.  The former attorney general Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One his week that the attempt was pointless because ultimately the ECJ has the final say. Some MPs think that judge-led law is just as bad coming from the UK Supreme Court as it is from the European Court. And politically there is no guarantee that a rarely-used constitutional long-stop would be enough to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU. But, right now, it appears to be the only game in town and it is the one the government is playing. "

David Cameron has been denounced by some of his own MPs for negotiating a ""threadbare"" deal, and more than 100 of his councillors are urging him to campaign to leave the EU. The tone of his speech in Hamburg suggests he will do no such thing - he pledged to campaign ""unequivocally"" for British membership on new terms, though included in his speech was his usual disclaimer that he ""rules nothing out"" until a deal is done.  We also got another glimpse of how the referendum will be fought - with a strong plea for Europe to ""stand together"" in an uncertain world.  But there was a recognition that he won't get everything he wants, when he said: ""Even when we have secured the changes I am arguing for, the job will not be done."" He portrayed Germany as an ally in arguing for further change but his opponents will pounce on this as evidence of the paucity of his demands. Mr Cameron argued it was in the two countries' interests for the EU to become more competitive and for rules to be put in place to ensure that both countries inside the eurozone and those outside could be mutually successful.""When Britain says we need to have a Europe that respects nation states and that we should be able to run our own welfare systems, those are calls which I believe resonate around Europe,"" he said.""So if by working together we can achieve these changes, then I will unequivocally recommend that Britain stays in a reformed European Union on these new terms. Of course, if we can't then I rule nothing out.""But I believe we can - and if we do, I believe we can win that referendum and that will be good for Britain, good for Germany and good for the whole of Europe.""Negotiations on the final wording of the deal - which includes an ""emergency brake"" on benefit payments to EU migrants and a UK opt-out from ""ever closer union"" - look set to carry on right up to the start of the summit on February 18.Speaking on Friday, French finance minister Michael Sapin warned that nothing in the deal could stand in the way of further eurozone integration or confer special status on a particular industry, such as financial services.The UK is seeking legal protection for the City of London from new regulations that would apply across the whole of the EU, including non-eurozone countries. But Mr Sapin said no country could have a veto on further economic union or exemptions from the provisions of the single market.A senior Tory backbencher has said that up to 100 Conservative MPs could end up supporting the Out campaign in a future referendum, including a number of current Cabinet ministers. More than 130 Conservative councillors have warned the prime minister risks splitting the party unless he accepts his renegotiation has failed and he campaigns for Britain to leave the EU.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"

""The allegations that were on Channel 4 News are, as far as I can see, completely unfounded,"" he added.Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.But Channel 4 News' political correspondent Michael Crick said he had uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.The programme found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.Michael Payne, who represented Labour in the Newark by-election, wrote to Nottinghamshire Police on Tuesday asking it to look into claims of ""undeclared"" spending by his rivals, saying he wanted reassurance that electoral laws and procedures had been complied with. Nottinghamshire Police confirmed it had received an e-mail on the issue, adding: ""This is the first communication we have received. The force will review the content of the communication, but we should make it clear that no investigation has been launched at this time.""The BBC understands that detectives in the Fraud and Financial Crimes Unit at Nottinghamshire Constabulary are handling the case.UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose party came second in Newark, has said the party will not make a formal complaint but he would support any complaints made by members of the public.A Conservative spokeswoman, speaking on Wednesday, said: ""All by-election spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."""

Privacy International, which launched the legal challenge with seven internet service providers, said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and would continue to challenge ""state-sponsored hacking,"" which it said was ""incompatible with democratic principles and human rights standards"". Scarlet Kim, Privacy International's legal officer, said: ""Hacking is one of the most intrusive surveillance capabilities available to intelligence agencies.

""Just because the government magically produces guidelines for hacking should not legitimise this practice.""She added that hacking ""fundamentally weakens the security of computers and the internet"" by exploiting the ""weaknesses in software and hardware used by millions of people"". ""It is akin to unlocking a person's window without their knowledge and leaving it open for any attacker - whether GCHQ, another country's intelligence agency or a cyber criminal - to access.""Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond welcomed the tribunal's ruling.""The ability to exploit computer networks plays a crucial part in our ability to protect the British public,"" he said.""Once again, the law and practice around our Security and Intelligence Agencies' capabilities and procedures have been scrutinised by an independent body and been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.""The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will further strengthen the safeguards for the Agencies' use of these powers, including a new double-lock authorisation process. ""It will provide our Security and Intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats our country faces, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements."""
2016-02-12,RBS boss supports EU membership,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35559602,"The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland says he believes the UK financial sector would be better off inside the European Union.Speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight, Ross McEwan said the uncertainty caused by the EU vote could ""slow down banking"".He said he would like the referendum to be held as early as possible, ideally in June.Mr McEwan added that he does not expect an interest rate rise before 2017.The UK is due to hold a referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union, before the end of 2017.In an interview with Newsnight's Kirsty Wark Mr McEwan said he had seen no ""economic data that suggests we'd be better off out in the short to medium term"".He said unpredictability around the referendum was causing problems for the UK's banks.""The issue we've got is the uncertainty which slows businesses down, which will over time slow down banking so it's... really good that the government is trying to have the vote very quickly.""On interest rates, Mr McEwan said he sees no prospect of any rise from the Bank of England in the near future.""We're going to have lower interest rates for a lot longer than was anticipated… I don't think [we'll have rate rises] for all this year and possibly all of 2017 as well. ""We just have to get used to an environment where we have low interest rates for a long period of time.""Mr McEwan suggested RBS had turned a corner under his leadership, but that it was likely the firm would post its eighth consecutive years of losses later this month.The bank has set aside considerable sums to pay for US-imposed fines over mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and payment protection insurance (PPI) payments.In line with other banks the share price of RBS has declined by nearly 45% in a year. The firm remains largely in public hands, with the British government owning a 73% stake, after a £45bn ($65bn) bailout in 2008. Chancellor George Osborne sold 5% of its stake last August, making a loss. The share price has fallen still further since then. Asked if the British taxpayer is likely to get its £45bn back, Mr McEwan said: ""At this rate no… We'd love to get that money back to the public because it's the public's money. ""But at the time, if they hadn't saved RBS then a lot of the financial services in the UK would have probably collapsed.""The full interview with the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Ross McEwan will be broadcast on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 GMT on Friday 12 February.

2016-02-12,Bercow's entertainment bill revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35559244,"Commons Speaker John Bercow has spent thousands of pounds on entertaining other MPs and foreign politicians since April 2012, including £1,600 on a lunch for his Lithuanian counterpart. The Press Association has published details of expenditure from Mr Bercow's official House account, obtained under Freedom of Information rules.It includes £1,023 for beeswax candles and £286 to tune a grand piano.The Speaker's office said spending was 19% lower than under his predecessor. Mr Bercow has been Speaker since 2009, when he replaced Michael Martin - who stepped down amid the Commons expenses scandal.He is not subject to such stringent rules on expenses as other MPs, whose claims for food and drink are capped. MPs travelling outside their constituency on parliamentary business can claim £25 a day on food and drink, excluding alcohol. According to the Press Association, Mr Bercow spent £2,223.34 on a dinner for the ""panel of chairs"" - a group of MPs who chair public bill committees - in January 2010. In 2015, he spent £2,057 on a dinner to mark the retirement of former Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Dawn Primarolo.Up to £7,400 has been charged to the taxpayer, since 2012, on annual receptions for members of Parliament following the State Opening of Parliament while £3,000 was spent on a reception for new MPs in July 2015.Spending on functions for foreign parliamentarians are also recorded in the figures. A lunch for the Romanian Speaker in December 2012 cost £1,521.37 while a similar event for the Slovenian Speaker a year later cost £1,444.74.A dinner in honour of the Australian Speaker in May 2014 cost £1,954.38.Other miscellaneous items of spending included £286 on tuning the grand piano in Speaker's House which is ""available for members to use upon request"". Official postcard-size portrait photographs of the Speaker and senior officials taken at the State Opening of Parliament, which are available ""on request"", cost £307 to produce in November 2014 and £210 in December 2012.An order for ""hand-finished"" beeswax candles was made in July 2012, to be used for official gatherings in the State Rooms.A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said they were not querying the figures but defended the outlay, saying every Speaker in modern times has hosted receptions for MPs after the State Opening and the cost of doing so had fallen by 77% since 2009.She said it was ""long-established practice"" for the Speaker to pay for drinks ahead of the panel of chairs' annual dinner, which he did not routinely attend, while the Speaker was traditionally expected to host occasions for foreign dignitaries and to mark the departure of retiring and new MPs.She said the Speaker was committed to cutting costs wherever possible and total spending by the Speaker's Office had fallen from £626,029 in 2009-10, the year in which he was elected, to £504,737 in 2014-15.""These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure including, among other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office,"" she said.The Press Association said the Commons was unable to supply any information prior to April 2012 since it had been ""destroyed in accordance with the parliamentary records disposal policy"". Pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance said no-one ""begrudged"" the Speaker for footing the bill for official functions he was responsible for hosting and it was encouraging that overall spending by his office had fallen. But it said all spending by the Speaker's office should be made public as a matter of course so it could be subject to ""proper scrutiny"".Details of Mr Bercow's travel expenses are published every year. Between April 2014 and April 2015, he claimed more than £31,000 in travel and accommodation expenses, figure published last July showed."
2016-02-12,World powers agree Syria war pause plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35556783,"World powers have agreed to seek a nationwide ""cessation of hostilities"" in Syria to begin in a week's time, after talks in Munich, Germany. The halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.The 17-member International Syria Support Group (ISSG) also agreed to accelerate and expand aid deliveries.The announcement comes as the Syrian army, backed by Russian air strikes, advances in Aleppo province.The move threatens to encircle tens of thousands of civilians in rebel-held parts of the major city of Aleppo.The Syrian government has not yet responded, though a key rebel coalition welcomed the announcement.""If we see action and implementation on the ground, we will be soon in Geneva,"" Salim al-Muslat told reporters, referring to the Swiss city where the UN is trying to get peace talks between the Syrian government and rebels off the ground.More than 250,000 people have been killed and 13.5 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.Both Sergei Lavrov and John Kerry admitted, repeatedly, this was only progress on paper. Some diplomats are already saying ""it's not worth the paper it's printed on"".There are still major gaps. One of the biggest is that Russia's bombing of Aleppo and what it calls terrorist targets is not included in the possible truce even though its actions are seen by many as strengthening Syrian government forces. On the issue of delivering desperately needed aid to besieged areas, UN officials say they are determined to seize this new opening. The next week will confirm whether Syria's government and opposition forces are ready to provide access denied for so long.  It will be a week which tests the commitment of all outside players, as well as Syrians on all sides. That, in itself, is some progress. But moving towards talks to end Syria's devastating war will still take far more than that. US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted the ceasefire plan was ""ambitious"" and said the real test would be whether the various parties honoured the commitments. ""What we have here are words on paper, what we need to see in the next few days are actions on the ground,"" he said. A task force chaired by the US and Russia will work to implement the truce through consultations with Syria's rival groups. Aid deliveries for besieged Syrian communities are due to begin as early as Friday.To try to immediately step up aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in SyriaFor a US/Russia-led task force to work to achieve a ""cessation of hostilities"" across Syria beginning in one week's time""Cessation of hostilities"" will exclude action against so-called Islamic State group, jihadist group al-Nusra Front and other UN-designated terrorist groupsTo work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in SyriaMr Kerry made the announcement alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.Mr Lavrov said there were ""reasons to hope we have done a great job today"". An earlier proposal from Russia envisaged a truce starting on 1 March.At the news conference Mr Kerry again suggested that Russian strikes were targeting what the West sees as moderate opposition forces, rather than terrorists, as Moscow says.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the cessation would only work if Russia halted its raids, although Mr Lavrov said they would continue.The ISSG also agreed that peace talks involving the Syrian government and rebels should resume as soon as possible.Initial talks were suspended just days after they began earlier this month in Geneva, in the wake of the Aleppo offensive.Thousands of people displaced by the fighting have been stranded at the border with Turkey and aid agencies have warned of a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.Why is there a war in Syria?Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.Who is fighting whom?Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. How has the world reacted?Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes."
2016-02-12,MP takes up motorway sausage offer,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-35559712,"Liz Truss has taken up ""one of the best offers she has had all year"" - a sausage at a service station on the M5.To howls of laughter in the Commons, the environment secretary was promised a ""warm welcome and a Gloucester Old Spot sausage"" by MP Richard Graham if she ever visited Gloucester Services.The M5 stop-off spot aims to defy the usual reputation of a motorway services by offering upmarket organic fare.On Friday she took up the offer, proclaiming her sausage as ""very nice"".Gloucester MP Mr Graham made the offer during a Parliamentary debate last week about the role of the Great British Food Unit. Unveiled by Ms Truss in November, the unit brings together ""food and drink pioneers"" with the aim of helping Britain to become a ""great food nation"". During the 4 February debate, Mr Graham told his Conservative colleague that his constituency was not only home to ""some of the greatest food"" in the world, but said the M5 service station had been described as ""probably the best"" in the United Kingdom.Tucking in to a cooked breakfast with all the trimmings on Friday morning, Ms Truss said she enjoyed the ""really lovely"" sausage, although she had not been ""expecting such a huge plate of food"".""It's very, very tasty, it's local and you can see the passion of the producers who make it,"" she said of the sausage, made from Gloucestershire Old Spot meat.She added that Gloucester Services was ""a brilliant example of promoting local food, bringing together local producers to something that is an amazing experience to all the visitors that come here"".Opened in May 2014, Gloucester Services features independent shops and restaurants selling produce from 130 local suppliers from within a 30-mile (50km) radius."
2016-02-12,New offer in fiscal framework talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35561614,"Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney has submitted a fresh proposal in talks to establish a ""fiscal framework"" for new devolved powers.The Scottish and UK governments have been locked in talks about a financial deal, with deadlines pushed back due to disagreements over key terms.Prime Minister David Cameron has said the deal needs to be fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK.Mr Swinney said UK taxpayers would ""not lose a single penny"" under his plans.The fiscal framework is the financial structure which will underpin new powers being devolved north of the border as part of the Scotland Bill.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon dismissed the Treasury's previous offer on the matter as resulting in an ""almost £3bn cut"" for the Scottish budget.The two parties disagree on a principle called for by the Smith Commission on new powers for Scotland known as ""no detriment"", which underlines that neither the Scottish or UK budgets should suffer from the terms agreed upon.However, they disagree on what form this should take, particularly over the matter of population growth. Scotland's population is expected to grow more slowly than that of the UK in the coming years, which could impact on the economy north of the border. Ms Sturgeon said the Treasury seemed to be trying to argue in terms of what detriment should be imposed on Scotland, and her spokesman later described the UK government's position on the matter as ""increasingly isolated"".Outlining his latest proposal to his Treasury counterpart Greg Hands, Mr Swinney said taxpayers in the rest of the UK ""are no better or worse off"" under his terms.He said: ""Under the Scottish government's method, taxpayers in the rest of the UK will see no detriment. They do not lose a single penny under these plans. ""And it will ensure that the Scottish budget bears the risk of population changes relative to the rest of the UK via the Barnett formula.""In line with the Smith agreement, the Scottish budget will bear the full financial costs or reap the full rewards of decisions taken here in Scotland. And our proposals will see Scotland bear the economic risk of delivering growth, via tax receipts.""This proposal addresses each of the specific technical concerns the UK government has raised publicly and privately. Agreement on indexation would allow us to focus on agreeing the remaining outstanding matters under the Fiscal Framework.""I hope we now have the basis of a deal.""Mr Cameron told MPs at his weekly questions session that no-one was ""keener"" than he was to reach an agreement on the deal, adding that ""there has to be fairness across the rest of the UK too"".However, in a letter to Ms Sturgeon he warned that the Scottish government must ""be prepared to move towards us"" to reach a compromise agreement.The prime minister said it would be ""very difficult"" for him to ""explain to taxpayers in the rest of the UK that Scotland will stop paying income tax into the central pot yet somehow still receive a share of it"".Holyrood's devolution committee has called for both sides to give a ""full explanation of their position on a fiscal framework"" by 23 February, when they will be called to give evidence before MSPs.Convener Bruce Crawford said there would be ""very substantial impacts"" on the Scottish Parliament's ability to scrutinise the deal before dissolution on 23 March if a deal is not struck soon."
2016-02-12,Firms forced to reveal gender pay gap,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35553573,"Companies that fail to address pay differences between male and female employees will be highlighted in new league tables under plans announced on Friday.Those with more than 250 employees will be forced to reveal their pay gap. The regulations will affect about 8,000 employers across the UK.They will need to start calculating the pay gap from April 2017 - 12 months ahead of the first tables being published.Latest figures suggest that women in the UK still earn on average 20% less than men. Under the plans announced by Women and Equalities Minister Nicky Morgan, private companies and voluntary organisations will be required to reveal the number of men and women in each pay range to show where pay gaps are at their widest.  Employers must also publish their gender pay gap on their websites. They will have to report every year and senior executives will be expected to sign off the figures personally.Ms Morgan said that women and men must be recognised equally and fairly in every workplace so there was ""nowhere for gender inequality to hide"".""I'm calling on women across Britain to use their position as employees and consumers to demand more from businesses, ensuring their talents are given the recognition and reward they deserve,"" she said.Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said that league tables should not be used to ""name and shame"" firms, because data could only give a partial picture - factors such as the mix of part-time and full-time workers, as well as sectoral differences, needed to be taken into account.""Where reporting can be useful is as a prompt for companies to ask the right questions about how they can eradicate the gender pay gap,"" she said.  ""The government should consult closely with business to ensure that this new legislation helps close the gender pay gap, rather than ending up as a box-ticking exercise.""How equal are you? Click through to find out how your country ranks for gender equalityHowever, Chartered Management Institute chief executive Ann Francke argued: ""Publishing league tables will drive diversity, bringing benefits not just to women but to business. Closing the pay gap will open the talent pipeline, increase management quality and boost productivity.""And the TUC said the plans did not go far enough. ""We're disappointed that firms won't have to publish their gender pay gap figures until 2018,"" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary.""It is a real shame that bosses won't be made to explain why pay gaps exist in their workplaces and what action they will take to narrow them.""That sentiment was echoed by Kate Green, the shadow minister for women and equality. ""At this rate, it will be another 47 years until the gap is closed, so we haven't a moment to lose,"" she said.Last summer, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to end the gender pay gap within a generation.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in November that the gap between men and women's pay for full-time workers was 9.4% in April 2015, compared with 9.6% in 2014.The government hopes to tackle the root causes by encouraging more girls to study maths and science over the next five years. Regina Moran, the chief executive of Fujitsu UK and Ireland, said many businesses had a cultural problem: ""It's important that companies eliminate any biased pay structures within the organisation. But differences in pay are often part of a wider context, as businesses fail to create environments that support women in the long term. ""Firms must also be aware of and eliminate any subliminal bias in hiring, promotions and pay rises."""
2016-02-12,'Lack of interest' in rail franchises,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35556870,"Taxpayers could end up out of pocket because not enough private firms want to bid to run rail franchises in England and Wales, MPs have warned.A lack of competition between companies bidding to operate routes could mean the government struggles to get value for money, a report by the Public Accounts Committee said.It urged ministers to develop an ""alternative commercial strategy"".The Department for Transport said it was ""working to actively seek"" bidders.MPs noted that the DfT - which is responsible for awarding rail franchises in England and Wales to private sector companies - requires at least three bids per franchise to ""create competitive tension"".However, the committee said there are signs that interest is ""dwindling"" among companies willing to make an offer.MPs expressed concern about the DfT's competition-led approach to franchising, warning there was ""a real risk to value for money"" if market interest declined any further.The report urged ministers to develop an alternative commercial strategy to be used if competition for franchises continues to fall and suggested looking at other markets where competition is low, such as energy, to see if lessons could be learned.The report said the first five franchises to be made available after the government's bidding programme was restarted in 2013 attracted three bids each. It compared with an average of four for the previous 10 rounds of bidding.There are 15 franchises in England and Wales which each give companies the right to run passenger services in a particular area for a specified period. They are awarded following a tendering process that involves the DfT asking for expressions of interest before it consults with the public and ultimately selects an operator from a short list of companies bidding for the contract. Last week, it was announced that two companies will compete to run the South Western franchise from next summer.Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""This hardly inspires confidence and highlights the urgent need for the department to develop new approaches it can draw on when there is a risk competition will not deliver the result rail users and the wider public deserve.""The committee said it was often cheaper for firms to compete for bus services or to bid for franchises in Europe.It concluded that it was ""not clear"" when rail users would see higher quality services and urged the DfT to develop partnerships with operators that ""facilitate innovation"".The DfT said it had introduced ""a series of measures which has brought new companies to the market"".""We have 11 owning groups already able to bid for franchises and we are working to actively seek further new entrants to the market,"" a spokesman said.Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, described the committee's findings as ""hopelessly inadequate"" and claimed rail franchising was ""actually far worse than it was in 2012"".Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow rail minister, said the ""damning report"" showed rail franchising ""isn't delivering for passengers"" and is ""broken"".He called on the government to provide a ""real alternative that would extend public ownership as franchises expire and put passengers first"".Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators and Network Rail, said: ""We support the need for a clear vision for the whole of Britain's railway network.""The independent passenger watchdog Transport Focus said it was important passengers' needs and priorities were built into each franchise contract."
2016-02-12,'Back door' council tax rises exposed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35501990,"Parish councils wanting to raise council tax ""excessively"" may have to first consult the public in line with larger authorities, the government has warned.Analysis by BBC News found thousands of parish and town councils in England increased their share of the annual bill, raising £18.9m in extra funds.The government said it could make them ""subject to the referendum principles"".But parish councils said that would be a threat to democracy.Figures show 3,659 parish councils raised the basic Band D tax bill by more than 1.99%, the referendum threshold for larger councils.  Sixty small authorities at least doubled residents' bills last year. Another 130 put their bills up by between 50 and 99% while 1,001 increased the annual bill for a Band D home by £5 or more.£34.27average annual share of a Band D council tax bill1.99%or £5 is the maximum others could increase without a referendum5,217 parish and town councils increased the bill 3,659 increased the basic demand by above 1.99% 60 parish councils at least doubled their bills in 2015-16 3,535 councils froze or reduced their precept Larger authorities and other bodies, such as police and crime commissioners, have to hold a referendum if they want a rise of 2% or more, or would raise bills by £5 per year per household. Parish councils are not subject to the same cap. This year, for larger councils, the threshold will be 3.99% as long as most of the increase funds adult care. Some parish councils now planning large percentage increases for 2016-17, such as Sandbach Town Council in east Cheshire. It will raise its share of the council tax by 30%, about £18 a year for a Band D household.A Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) spokesman said:  ""Town and parish councils should protect their taxpayers from excessive council tax increases; if they fail to do so, government has the option of making them subject to the referendum principles in future.""This government is determined to keep council tax down with average council tax bills set to be less in real terms in 2020 than they were in 2010.""The spokesman would not say whether there was a percentage rise threshold in mind for parish councils. Defending the proposed rise, Sandbach Labour councillor Sam Corcoran said: ""It's a large percentage increase but it's a small absolute increase. We've had our grant cut from Cheshire East Council, but more importantly we've got some exciting plans to redevelop the town centre, which will go out to consultation. ""If we decide not to go ahead, we will give the money back again.""One parish council chairman said the threat of a referendum would be bad for democracy.Winchfield Parish Council in Hampshire, which has 260 homes, increased its council tax bills by £67.16 for Band D properties last year, raising them from £19.98 to £87.13.  It was the largest rise in cash terms in England. The parish council's share is on top of a further £1,408 split between Hampshire County Council, the fire and rescue authority, police and crime commissioner and Hart District Council.The council said it did so in order to fund planning consultants to help it challenge Hart District Council's plan for 5,000 new homes.We've basically taken everything out of the piggy bankChairman and Conservative councillor Andrew Renshaw said: ""Parish councils are the closest of all authorities to their community and are responsive to how their electors feel.  If they feel we should be spending this sort of money, we should have the right to do so and it would be bad for democracy to take that right away.""Councillor Ken Browse, the chairman of the National Association of Local Councils, said parishes had increased their charges to pay for services, which had been withdrawn by larger authorities.He said: ""Local (parish and town) councils have been stepping up to the plate to take on a range of discretionary services which principal councils simply cannot afford to run any more - important local services and facilities such as libraries, toilets, youth work, community buildings and economic development activity.""Add this to an already extensive range of visible services - like bus shelters, maintaining commons and open spaces, crime and community safety measures, running events and festivals, providing leisure and sports facilities - the average local council costs just £50 a year, less than a pound a week.""DCLG figures reveal out of 8,752 parish councils who had a share of council tax this year and last, 3,535 reduced or froze Band D bills.Some parishes are also planning further rises from April, after taking on services previously run by district or county councils.Newquay Town Council will put its council tax precept up 90%, adding £100 to a typical annual bill.Frodsham Town Council in Cheshire is increasing its precept by 50%, equivalent to about £20 a year more for a Band D house.Its chairman, Michael Pusey, said a referendum or a cap would put it out of business.""We've basically taken everything out of the piggy bank, he said.""If something went wrong, like a play area got vandalised, anything like that, we would not be able to do it. We need reserves to be able to do these things.""At first glance, the largest percentage rise in parish council tax precepts is an eye-watering one at almost 1,200%.Thistleton in Rutland, which serves a community of 46 homes, actually asked for just £21.41 per Band D home, spread over the year.It was a very large rise compared with the modest £1.65 residents were asked for in 2014-15. The increase was imposed following a request to set up a ""school bus escort"".The money paid for another adult, besides the driver, to be on the bus that passes through neighbouring villages, making sure the children were safe and well-behaved on their journey to school.But it was not without controversy and the rise in the precept is being reduced again from April.Helen Crisostomo, clerk of Thistleton Parish Council, said: ""I gather the service was well-received but the decision went through without full attendance by parishioners and it's being reversed for the next year. The increase was a lot of money for older people who live alone."" Another large percentage increase was in Clarendon Park in Wiltshire, a parish of 250 people, where a 521% rise took the bill from £5.24 for a Band D home to £32.53.However, parish clerk Dawn Jacobs said bills would reduce in the next financial year.She said: ""We requested a precept of £600 last year which went up to £3,600 this year.""The reason for that was we needed to purchase new notice boards for the area and we also had a bus shelter that had been vandalised. They cost about £3,000 to replace. Our request for 2016-17 will be £200.""Under the Coalition government, councils and other local authorities were stopped from increasing council tax by 2% or more without first holding a referendum, but the rules do not apply to parish councils.The first such referendum took place in May 2015 and was triggered when Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins imposed a 15.8% increase in his force's share of council tax to pay for more officers.  However, voters rejected the rise at the ballot box.For the coming year, Chancellor George Osborne has raised the limit for a referendum to 3.99%, on condition that half the rise be used as a ""social care precept"" to fund adult care."
2016-02-12,NHS bosses speak out on doctors letter,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35557135,"Some NHS bosses have distanced themselves from suggestions they backed a new junior doctors contract being imposed, after their names were linked to a letter used to justify the move.Names of 20 chief executives appeared on a letter from the government's chief negotiator, advising it to do ""whatever it deems necessary"" to end the row.On Thursday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a contract would be imposed.But 10 of the letter's signatories say they do not support the decision.Ministers took the decision to impose the contract in England after their mediator Sir David Dalton advised them a negotiated outcome ""no longer seems possible"".In his letter to Mr Hunt, Sir David said the recommendation ""to make sure that a new contract is in place"" was supported by ""chief executives across the country"", and supplied 20 names.Analysis: Where now for junior doctors' dispute?Some half of the signatories have since stressed that they did not agree to the contract being forced on medics.  Sir Andrew Cash, head of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said he supported ""the improved offer made this week as fair and reasonable"", but said: ""I do not support imposition.""Meanwhile, Andrew Foster, of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""I have not supported contract imposition. I have supported the view that the offer made is reasonable.""Responding, Sir David told the Health Service Journal (HSJ) the statement they had agreed to ""was confirming that the best and final position was considered fair and reasonable, and that they believed the NHS needed certainty and not continuation of the stalemate"".He continued that if anyone wanted to make an inference from this that they supported imposition, ""then that is their inference, [but] that is not what [the signatories] have committed their names to"". ""I neither want to say they do or that they don't. There is a variety of opinion on this.""The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym said the debate over whether there was wider support among NHS leaders for the government's stance could turn out ""to be a storm in a teacup"".But he said it was an ""unfortunate development as ministers embarked upon what may prove to be a long-haul task of finalising and pushing through the contract"".The junior doctors row explainedReaction to the junior doctors' disputeWhat exactly do junior doctors do?How does your job compare?Junior doctor leaders have promised to fight on after the government in England announced it would impose a new contract on the profession.It comes after junior doctors staged a second 24-hour strike over the controversial new contract.The British Medical Association's junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana said it was ""flawed"" and they had put forward a ""fair and affordable"" alternative.Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Hunt said the contract was an ""important step"" in improving care at weekends.He said the government's door had ""remained open for three years"" but the BMA had proved ""unwilling"" to show flexibility and compromise.In theory, it is pretty easy. Junior doctors rotate through jobs quickly so within a year of the new contract coming into force in August the majority of the 55,000-strong workforce would be on it. All new doctors graduating from medical school will also go on it.There are some who are on longer contracts, who will not go on it straight away, while others will have completed their training before it affects them. This group represents about a fifth of the workforce, it is thought.Between now and the summer hospitals will have to review their rotas and staffing requirements, before sending out offers to junior doctors in May.But the big unknown is how the British Medical Association and medical workforce will react. While in the long-term doctors have warned of ""brain-drain"" with medics heading abroad, to other parts of the UK or into other sectors, such as the drugs industry. This, it seems, is uncharted territory - imposing a whole new contract on doctors like this has never been done before it is believed."

2016-02-12,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman.

He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-12,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-12,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-12,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-12,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-12,'Unity reshuffle?',https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35545830,"They'll laugh it off for now, as governments always do. But as the prime minister enters this last week of negotiation before the crunch EU summit in Brussels next week, ministers' minds are turning to what happens in the aftermath, not just of the summit, but the referendum itself. And while Number 10 won't countenance any discussion of moves for its top team, several sources have told me that a reshuffle following a theoretical government victory in the referendum is very much on the cards. One source told me a ""unity reshuffle"" is being planned, to pull the party back together after the campaign to show that the Conservatives had a debate about Europe, and it was not a disaster. One senior minister told me ""there is bound to be"" a reorganisation, and maybe quite a big one, of the senior team. And it could be David Cameron's most wide-ranging reshuffle ever. He has never been fond of moving ministers around - reshuffles are notoriously hard to get right - and he's believed it makes sense to allow ministers time to master their brief, well at least not be shoved out at the first sign of trouble. Even after the general election, he left his senior team relatively intact. But after a very unusual permitted period of disagreement during the referendum campaign, a reshuffle where Eurosceptics are embraced, even promoted, could be used to show that the government can move forward as a team. A senior minister said there will be an ""overarching need to bring the party together to govern"". There are many moving parts to all of this. It's not even clear yet which ministers will declare for the Eurosceptic cause, although you'd get a decent bet on Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, Theresa Villiers, John Whittingdale, Michael Gove and still possibly Sajid Javid. And then there's even Mayor of London Boris Johnson. And of course it is not at all certain that the pro EU side of the argument will win the referendum. If David Cameron loses, all bets are off, and his job might even be on the line. But if he wins, and this reshuffle comes to pass, who might go where? Well, there would likely be a senior job for Boris Johnson, maybe as home secretary or even defence secretary with a move in turn, for Theresa May, perhaps to the Foreign Office. Mr Johnson turned down a Cabinet job after the general election, but the prime minister has promised there will be another offer. Michael Fallon, the current defence secretary, could replace Chris Grayling as leader of the House of Commons. It's likely too that there would be another senior woman promoted into the Cabinet, perhaps Anna Soubry or Priti Patel. None of this, of course, is certain. Politics is in a strangely febrile place, and it would be foolhardy to predict much about the next few months with much conviction. Downing Street sources say it's nonsense to suggest they are putting time and energy into planning a reshuffle. The focus is all on the renegotiation, then winning the referendum. Yet as ministers make their minds up which side to take in the campaign, don't doubt that their futures after the public vote are just as much of a preoccupation as the principles of stay or go. "
2016-02-12,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands. Randolph was heard to say: ""I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."""

2016-02-12,Labour's bomb,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35371074,"Clement Attlee is revered on the left as the father of the NHS and the welfare state. What is less celebrated, but no less true, is his role as the father of Britain's nuclear bomb.It was Attlee, as Labour's post-war prime minister, who made sure Britain got its own ""nuclear deterrent"", committing millions to its development at a time when the country was technically bankrupt.He did it in secret, without a debate in Parliament or the Labour Party, partly out of a desire to avoid damaging rows. The rows would come soon enough - and are continuing to split the party more than 70 years later, as Jeremy Corbyn wrestles with the seemingly impossible task of reconciling its pro and anti-nuclear factions.Attlee had his reasons for wanting Britain to become a nuclear-armed nation. He had just been elected prime minister when America dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in August 1945. He realised in an instant that the air raid wardens and fire engines that had fought to limit the damage done by Nazi bombs, were now useless in the face of the awesome destructive power of this new weapon. The only way to protect the population, he reasoned, was to have the ability to fight back.""The answer to an atomic bomb on London is an atomic bomb on another great city,"" he wrote in a secret memo to a cabinet committee 22 days after Hiroshima.This is the concept of a nuclear deterrent and ""mutually assured destruction"" in embryo.But Attlee was no warmonger. He wanted to rid the world of the menace of nuclear war by handing control of the weapons to the United Nations, even arguing that information about the bomb should be shared with the Soviet Union.""He immediately recognised the potential importance of nuclear weapons both for the conduct of war and for the conduct of international relations,"" wrote Len Scott, former professor of international history at Aberystwyth University in an essay on Labour and the bomb.But at the same time, added Prof Scott, he believed that Britain must have its own bomb, a need that became more pressing when the Americans passed a law, in August 1946, preventing it from sharing atomic secrets with other nations, including its closest wartime allies Britain and Canada, whose scientists had worked alongside the Americans to develop the Hiroshima bomb at Los Alamos.Debate raged in cabinet committees between those, like Chancellor Hugh Dalton, who argued that Britain could not afford a bomb, or the new V-force aircraft needed to deliver it, and those who argued that the country needed to keep its place at the top table and avoid being humiliated by the Americans.""We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs,"" foreign secretary, and former trade union leader, Ernest Bevin, is reported to have told one committee. ""We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.""A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacementIs there such a thing as a nuclear button?How important is Trident to the UK's security and international standing?Bevin's national prestige argument won the day - and it would surface again in 1957, when left-winger Aneurin Bevan surprised supporters by hitting back at calls for Britain to get rid of it nuclear weapons by telling that year's party conference the unilateralists were gripped by an ""an emotional spasm"" that would send a future Labour foreign secretary ""naked into the conference chamber"". Labour's leadership argued at the time that Britain should only abandon its weapons if it could persuade other countries, such as China and France, to do likewise (persuading the Soviet Union and the US to disarm was seen as a non-starter).But the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), formed in 1957, was growing in influence within the party, making the argument on moral grounds against weapons of mass destruction, with the Hydrogen bomb, a vastly more powerful weapon, recently tested by Britain, looming over the debate.CND's calls for Britain to unilaterally scrap its weapons briefly became party policy, before being overturned at the 1961 conference.Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson fought the 1964 general election questioning Britain's nuclear deterrent, declaring in Labour's manifesto that Polaris, American nuclear weapons to be fitted to British-built submarines under an agreement brokered by Tory PM Harold Macmillan, ""will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter"".  Attlee was even wheeled out, in a party election broadcast, to denounce the independent deterrent as a ""nonsense"".But the manifesto did not include an explicit commitment to abandon Polaris, just reassess the deal with the Americans, and although Wilson reduced the number of submarines from five to four, and brokered a non-proliferation treaty, Polaris became operational in 1968, beginning the round-the-clock patrols that continue to this day.The left felt betrayed by Wilson and when Labour unexpectedly went into opposition after the 1970 general election the party renewed its commitment to scrap Polaris and end moves towards a new generation of nuclear weapons, neither of which it did when it returned to power in 1974.When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979, the nuclear issue erupted with renewed ferocity in the Labour Party, against a backdrop of escalating tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union.It had now become a hugely symbolic issue for the party, a key dividing line between the left and right, who would eventually break away to form their own party, the SDP, to fight the 1983 general election. Then Labour leader Michael Foot, a founder member of CND, was a unilateralist, who also vowed to remove US nuclear weapons from British soil. His successor Neil Kinnock, was also a unilateralist, although he would drop the policy after losing the 1987 election, arguing that the best way to achieve a nuclear-free world was through negotiation between nuclear-armed nations.Kinnock had united the party behind scrapping nuclear weapons by arguing that the money spent on Trident - the replacement for Polaris - should go towards bolstering Britain's conventional forces instead, but he still faced accusations from the Conservatives that he was ""soft"" on defence and would make Britain a target for Soviet invasion. There were also questions about how Labour could scrap its weapons on moral grounds yet still expect to shelter under America's ""nuclear umbrella"" and how it could remain a member of nuclear-armed NATO.Tony Blair banished unilateralism from New Labour's vocabulary, along with other policies thought to be harming its credibility with centre ground voters. But the nuclear issue still had the power to split the party - in 2006 he faced his biggest rebellion since the Iraq war over plans to push ahead with a replacement for Trident, when 88 Labour MPs voted against the government. The backing of the Conservatives ensured Blair  won the vote convincingly. His argument to MPs was that Trident was the ""ultimate insurance"" and that it would be ""unwise and dangerous"" for Britain to unilaterally give up its nuclear capability.One of the rebels who spoke against Blair that night was veteran backbencher and CND stalwart Jeremy Corbyn, who quoted the mayor of Hiroshima in his speech, who had ""pleaded"" with Britain not to ""develop a new generation of nuclear missiles"".""We face an important decision tonight,"" said the Islington North MP. ""Either we endorse this vast expenditure, or we encourage a public debate that I believe will come down on the side of sanity, sense and peace in the world, and we do not go ahead with this vast expenditure that can lead only to a more dangerous world.""The idea that Corbyn would one day succeed Blair as Labour leader, and re-open the party's debate about unilateral disarmament, would have seemed pretty far-fetched to the MPs in the Commons chamber that night, including Corbyn himself. But he has now has the chance he has long craved to persuade the public of the ""sanity"" of his case.Labour has tended to be gripped by internal rows about scrapping nuclear weapons when it has been in opposition for some years, only to maintain the deterrent when it returns to power.But, as the party's resurgent unilateralists point out, this is the first time Labour has seriously debated the issue in a post-Cold War context. It is a very different world to the one facing Attlee in 1945.The challenge for Labour's defence review, headed by Emily Thornberry, is to avoid the Cold War thinking that still tends dominates both sides of the debate and see the issue with fresh eyes.Given the party's tortured history, that will not be easy."
2016-02-12,Spy bill analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35553408,"Everyone agrees a new law governing surveillance powers is required but the devil is in the detail, as a series of parliamentary reports have illustrated. The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.The Joint Parliamentary Committee makes 86 recommendations overall but the central thrust is that while the direction of the draft bill is broadly correct, the government still needs to make significant changes, particularly in making a number of provisions clearer.The bill aims to takes powers which were previously exercised using often obscure legal provisions and put them onto a clearer footing. But one of the most controversial provisions is a new power - to compel companies to keep Internet Connection Records (ICRs) for 12 months which detail the sites everyone visits on the web (although not what exact page). Not enough has been done to explain what is involved, the committee says. Law enforcement rather than spies are the chief sponsors of this provision and the committee gives them support for the overall concept (even adding that they could be expanded to identify people visiting websites which hold illegal material rather than just for identifying forms of communication). However, it says that more needs to be done on the detail. In particular there are problems over defining ICRs, over the technical feasibility of their collection and storage as well as the costs involved. All of this may make it challenging to deliver them in the timescale envisaged. Bulk Personal Datasets are another area of concern. Clear justifications and operational cases for why the powers are required remain lacking, the committee says, also criticising government for being unwilling to provide much detail of what kinds of datasets would be involved.Some might be obvious such as passport records but others - like health records - would be far more sensitive. It is notable in the report that the committee tried to get an answer on whether records such as health data would be excluded but was not given one by government.There is relatively little detail on the issue of encryption which has been of concern to many companies (notably Apple which submitted detailed evidence).A report from the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns from industry about the potential impact of ambiguity in some provisions. The indications are that the government wants to retain its right to seek unencrypted data even if it knows it may not always be possible to obtain it.  There are still some concerns from industry over what is meant when its said that companies need to take ""practicable"" steps to provide such data and what impact it has on end-to-end encryption systems. Some companies also remain concerned they could be compelled to hack into their own products under equipment interference provisions.The Joint Committee also calls for some significant changes to the way in which judges provide oversight over powers to increase independence. On intelligence sharing, the Joint Committee also notably calls for it to be made illegal to get another country to spy on behalf of a UK agency or body when it does not have the authorisation to collect such information. The legislation is often technical by necessity and so a lot of weight is placed on ""codes of practice"" which outline how exactly the powers should be used. The committee say these should be published along with the bill to provide greater transparency and clarity.The Intelligence and Security Committee report earlier in the week focused more narrowly on intelligence agency powers but took a tougher line. It criticised the lack of an over-arching privacy protection and also said that when challenged about what the power of bulk equipment interference actually involved, officials were unable to provide an answer. The committee have rejected the idea of a sunset clause in which the powers would expire after five years instead calling for a joint committee to review the use of the powers as the five year point approached.There were clearly differences of opinion within the committee and despite the huge amount of evidence it took, some still feel it may have had to rush. One member, Lord Strasburger argued the government had not learnt the lesson of drafting a bill too broadly and said that essential information was missing that parliament needed in order to decide if the powers were necessary and proportionate. The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year."
2016-02-12,Sovereign strategies,https://web.archive.org//web/20160212233347/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35539860,"Governments rarely perform miracles but they do try to square circles. And that is what David Cameron's ministers are attempting right now with Britain's constitution.They are looking for a way of asserting the sovereignty and authority of parliament over the EU in a way that convinces voters - and Boris Johnson - that Britain's relationship with the continent is changing.But they need to do this without claiming that UK law has primacy over EU law, something that would be tantamount to leaving the EU. As you might imagine, this is not proving an easy piece of constitutional carpentry.Clever minds in Whitehall are looking at two potential options, both of which would involve parliament giving greater authority to the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.One option would involve the Supreme Court assessing decisions by the ECJ and considering whether they breach the fundamental principles of Britain's constitutional norms that have been laid down over the centuries in various Acts of Parliament and common law. This would follow a similar path to the German constitutional court which can assess whether ECJ decisions challenge Germany's constitution.The problem with this option, of course, is that Britain does not have a single, codified constitution and so legal comparisons would be complex to say the least. And there is also the small problem that placing British constitutional traditions ahead of EU law would effectively leave the UK in breach of the many treaties it has signed over the years as a member of the European Union. If you don't sign up to the club rules, you can't be a member of the club.So a second option is being considered that some see as being perhaps more feasible. This would again involve parliament beefing up the authority of the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice. But - and here's the clever part - the Supreme Court would do this only in exceptional circumstances if it thought the judges in Luxembourg were breaching not UK law, but EU law.Crucially, the Supreme Court would not be questioning the supremacy of EU law. It would simply be ensuring that the UK obeyed the EU treaties which it had signed up to, rather than how those treaties were being interpreted by judges in Luxembourg. Now this might sound mad, or at the very least counter-intuitive. But national courts like the UK Supreme Court have already questioned what some see as the ""judicial activism"" of the European Court of Justice. Some courts think that the ECJ has on occasion exceeded its jurisdiction and made judgements that are not based on EU treaties.In a case last year, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether Home Secretary Theresa May was legally able to deprive a Vietnamese man of his UK citizenship because he was considered by the security services to be a threat to national security.The European Court of Justice has in various judgements challenged such decisions because it believes that EU citizenship is dependent on national citizenship and therefore it has a right to poke its nose in decisions like this.But the Supreme Court questioned this judicial activism which it considered was not based on any EU treaty text. In a judgement on the so-called Pham case, on 25 March 2015, the judges said in, paragraph 90:""A domestic court faces a particular dilemma if, in the face of the clear language of a Treaty and of associated declarations and decisions, such as those mentioned in paras 86-89, the Court of Justice reaches a decision which oversteps jurisdictional limits which Member States have clearly set at the European Treaty level and which are reflected domestically in their constitutional arrangements. But, unless the Court of Justice has had conferred upon it under domestic law unlimited as well as unappealable power to determine and expand the scope of European law, irrespective of what the Member States clearly agreed, a domestic court must ultimately decide for itself what is consistent with its own domestic constitutional arrangements, including in the case of the 1972 Act what jurisdictional limits exist under the European Treaties and upon the competence conferred on European institutions including the Court of Justice.""Now that might read as a lot of rather wordy legalese but it is in fact the highest court of the land very gently and very politely telling its counterpart in Luxembourg to go stick. This led the legal expert, Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, to conclude in a lecture on November 2015 that:""There is no doubt that some of the case-law of the Court of Justice has been regarded by the supreme courts of Member States as exceeding the jurisdiction conferred upon it, and in so doing encroaching in an unauthorised way upon the national legal systems. UK judges have expressed concerns of precisely this kind. In my mind they have been right to do so.""He added: ""Leaving the protection of the UK constitution to UK judges is not necessarily at odds with the UK government considering whether something further might be done in support of the role of the national judiciary. That ""something further"" might include providing statutory recognition of the limits of EU law supremacy under the European Communities Act. It is understandable that the prime minister might think that the present is an appropriate time for review of the UK constitutional position.""And Professor Wyatt is not alone. Anthony Speaight QC, who served on the government's Commission on a UK Bill of Rights, gave evidence to MPs on the All Party Group on the Rule of Law this month and he told them in a written submission:""It would do no violence to UK legal principles, and arguably would be to perfect and enhance them, if Parliament were to amend (section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972) to clarify that the domestic courts are not to enforce EU instruments and decisions if they find them to be outside EU competences, and that ECJ decisions as to whether acts are within or without competence are to be no more than persuasive authority.""Mr Speaight accepted that such a power would be ""a nuclear weapon"" that the Supreme Court would be reluctant to use. But he concluded:""It might be judged that the theoretical existence of the review in the hands of a court with so high an international reputation as the UK Supreme Court would act as a salutary warning to EU institutions to respect the limits of competence and subsidiarity.""Now this option, of beefing up the powers of the Supreme Court, is not without its problems. Some lawyers argue that there is no distinction between EU treaties and how the ECJ interprets those treaties.  The former attorney general Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One his week that the attempt was pointless because ultimately the ECJ has the final say. Some MPs think that judge-led law is just as bad coming from the UK Supreme Court as it is from the European Court. And politically there is no guarantee that a rarely-used constitutional long-stop would be enough to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU. But, right now, it appears to be the only game in town and it is the one the government is playing. "

MPs are expected to vote this year on whether to back government plans to renew the UK's four Trident submarines.Labour is currently reviewing its support for the weapons.Renewing the Trident fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade, is estimated by the government to cost £31bn, although opponents claim the final bill will be far higher. Asked whether the UK should be investing in a new fleet of submarines amid stretched defence resources, Mr Carter replied unequivocally that it should. He said Trident aided the UK's ""special relationship"" with the US and helped it ""continue to play that outsized role on the global stage that it does because of its moral standing and its historical standing"". ""It's important that the military power matches that standing and so we're very supportive of it,"" he said.Mr Carter said the UK and US each had independent authority to use Trident but were ""dependent upon one another industrially"". ""We depend upon the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom depends on us, that's part of the special relationship,"" he told the BBC. ""We build joint strike fighters together, we build Trident missiles together.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a longstanding opponent of nuclear weapons and has commissioned a review by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry. But some of the party's MPs and peers have threatened to resign if it reverses its decades-long support for the missiles. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham, who backs renewal, recently indicated it may be ""impossible"" for Labour to reach an agreed position on Trident.The US defence secretary was asked about Ms Thornberry's suggestion that underwater drones could be able to detect submarines in future, making them vulnerable to attack and obsolete.Mr Carter, who this week attended a meeting with Nato defence ministers in Brussels, said the ability of submarines to ""operate stealthily"" was proven.""We are, in fact, making large investments in undersea forces because of their survive-ability, as well as their power,"" he said.Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.Four UK submarines carry up to eight Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads.A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacement"

""The allegations that were on Channel 4 News are, as far as I can see, completely unfounded,"" he added.Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.But Channel 4 News' political correspondent Michael Crick said he had uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.The programme found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.Michael Payne, who represented Labour in the Newark by-election, wrote to Nottinghamshire Police on Tuesday asking it to look into claims of ""undeclared"" spending by his rivals, saying he wanted reassurance that electoral laws and procedures had been complied with. Nottinghamshire Police confirmed it had received an e-mail on the issue, adding: ""This is the first communication we have received. The force will review the content of the communication, but we should make it clear that no investigation has been launched at this time.""The BBC understands that detectives in the Fraud and Financial Crimes Unit at Nottinghamshire Constabulary are handling the case.UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose party came second in Newark, has said the party will not make a formal complaint but he would support any complaints made by members of the public.A Conservative spokeswoman, speaking on Wednesday, said: ""All by-election spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."""
2016-02-13,GCHQ computer hacking ruled lawful,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35558349,"GCHQ is operating within the law when it hacks into computers and smart phones, a security tribunal has ruled.Campaigners Privacy International have lost a legal challenge claiming the spying post's hacking operations are too intrusive and break European law.The case was launched after revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of US and UK spying.GCHQ admitted its agents hack devices, in the UK and abroad, for the first time during the hearings.Its previous policy had been to ""neither confirm nor deny"" the existence of such operations.Hackers can remotely activate cameras and microphones on devices, without the owner's knowledge, log keystrokes, install malware, copy documents and track locations among other things, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) was told.The Home Office has now published a code of practice for hacking, or ""equipment interference"" as it is also known, and aims to put it on a firmer legal footing in its Investigatory Powers Bill, which is due to become law later this year.The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a panel of senior judges, said in its ruling that the code struck the right balance between the ""urgent need of the Intelligence Agencies to safeguard the public and the protection of an individual's privacy and/or freedom of expression"".But the judges were ""satisfied"" the agency was already operating in a lawful and proportionate way, whatever the outcome of Parliament's scrutiny of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Privacy International, which launched the legal challenge with seven internet service providers, said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and would continue to challenge ""state-sponsored hacking,"" which it said was ""incompatible with democratic principles and human rights standards"". Scarlet Kim, Privacy International's legal officer, said: ""Hacking is one of the most intrusive surveillance capabilities available to intelligence agencies. ""This case exposed not only these secret practices but also the undemocratic manner in which the government sought to backdate powers to do this under the radar. ""Just because the government magically produces guidelines for hacking should not legitimise this practice.""She added that hacking ""fundamentally weakens the security of computers and the internet"" by exploiting the ""weaknesses in software and hardware used by millions of people"". ""It is akin to unlocking a person's window without their knowledge and leaving it open for any attacker - whether GCHQ, another country's intelligence agency or a cyber criminal - to access.""Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond welcomed the tribunal's ruling.""The ability to exploit computer networks plays a crucial part in our ability to protect the British public,"" he said.""Once again, the law and practice around our Security and Intelligence Agencies' capabilities and procedures have been scrutinised by an independent body and been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.""The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will further strengthen the safeguards for the Agencies' use of these powers, including a new double-lock authorisation process. ""It will provide our Security and Intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats our country faces, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements."""
2016-02-13,RBS boss supports EU membership,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35559602,"The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland says he believes the UK financial sector would be better off inside the European Union.Speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight, Ross McEwan said the uncertainty caused by the EU vote could ""slow down banking"".He said he would like the referendum to be held as early as possible, ideally in June.Mr McEwan added that he does not expect an interest rate rise before 2017.The UK is due to hold a referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union, before the end of 2017.In an interview with Newsnight's Kirsty Wark Mr McEwan said he had seen no ""economic data that suggests we'd be better off out in the short to medium term"".He said unpredictability around the referendum was causing problems for the UK's banks.""The issue we've got is the uncertainty which slows businesses down, which will over time slow down banking so it's... really good that the government is trying to have the vote very quickly.""On interest rates, Mr McEwan said he sees no prospect of any rise from the Bank of England in the near future.""We're going to have lower interest rates for a lot longer than was anticipated… I don't think [we'll have rate rises] for all this year and possibly all of 2017 as well. ""We just have to get used to an environment where we have low interest rates for a long period of time.""Mr McEwan suggested RBS had turned a corner under his leadership, but that it was likely the firm would post its eighth consecutive years of losses later this month.The bank has set aside considerable sums to pay for US-imposed fines over mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and payment protection insurance (PPI) payments.In line with other banks the share price of RBS has declined by nearly 45% in a year. The firm remains largely in public hands, with the British government owning a 73% stake, after a £45bn ($65bn) bailout in 2008. Chancellor George Osborne sold 5% of its stake last August, making a loss. The share price has fallen still further since then. Asked if the British taxpayer is likely to get its £45bn back, Mr McEwan said: ""At this rate no… We'd love to get that money back to the public because it's the public's money. ""But at the time, if they hadn't saved RBS then a lot of the financial services in the UK would have probably collapsed.""The full interview with the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Ross McEwan will be broadcast on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 GMT on Friday 12 February.

2016-02-13,PM: UK will not 'retreat from world',https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35562698,"David Cameron has said Britain will never ""retreat from the world"" and it is in Europe's interests for the UK to stay in a reformed European Union.Speaking in Hamburg, the PM said changes he was seeking to UK membership would make Europe ""more outward-looking, competitive and dynamic"".He said if he got what he wanted he would campaign ""unequivocally"" for the UK to stay in.Campaigners for EU exit have said the PM's renegotiation is a sham.The prime minister is hoping for a deal at next week's summit of EU leaders in Brussels to allow him to put the new terms of membership to the British public in a referendum in June.But Donald Tusk, the European Council president who is brokering talks on the UK's renegotiation process, has warned that the political process remains ""very fragile"", with some leaders still harbouring reservations about the plan, particularly over limits on welfare payments to new EU migrants.In his final major speech before next week's crunch meeting, Mr Cameron told business, political and civic leaders in Hamburg that he made no apology for Britain being ""argumentative and rather strong-minded"" when it came to the subject of Europe.""We have the character of an island nation - independent, forthright, passionate in defence of our sovereignty - and of institutions that have served us well for many hundreds of years,"" he said.""And the need to protect our sovereignty has always been paramount for us.""But he told his audience at the Matthiae-Mahlzeit dinner - which included German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that Britain was an ""open nation"" and the values it shared with Germany underpinned their co-operation on trade, enterprise and security. Downing Street said the prime minister and Mrs Merkel also held a meeting - agreeing that EU countries and institutions needed to continue to work together to reach a deal on the UK's renegotiation.Other topics discussed included migration and implementing the £6.8bn in pledges made by countries at last week's London conference to help Syrians affected by the five-year conflict, a Number 10 spokesman said.David Cameron has been denounced by some of his own MPs for negotiating a ""threadbare"" deal, and more than 100 of his councillors are urging him to campaign to leave the EU. The tone of his speech in Hamburg suggests he will do no such thing - he pledged to campaign ""unequivocally"" for British membership on new terms, though included in his speech was his usual disclaimer that he ""rules nothing out"" until a deal is done.  We also got another glimpse of how the referendum will be fought - with a strong plea for Europe to ""stand together"" in an uncertain world.  But there was a recognition that he won't get everything he wants, when he said: ""Even when we have secured the changes I am arguing for, the job will not be done."" He portrayed Germany as an ally in arguing for further change but his opponents will pounce on this as evidence of the paucity of his demands. In his speech, Mr Cameron argued it was in the two countries' interests for the EU to become more competitive and for rules to ensure that both countries inside the eurozone and those outside could be mutually successful.""When Britain says we need to have a Europe that respects nation states and that we should be able to run our own welfare systems, those are calls which I believe resonate around Europe,"" he said.""So if by working together we can achieve these changes, then I will unequivocally recommend that Britain stays in a reformed European Union on these new terms. Of course, if we can't then I rule nothing out.""But I believe we can - and if we do, I believe we can win that referendum and that will be good for Britain, good for Germany and good for the whole of Europe.""Negotiations on the final wording of the deal - which includes an ""emergency brake"" on benefit payments to EU migrants and a UK opt-out from ""ever closer union"" - look set to carry on right up to the start of the summit on 18 February.A senior Tory backbencher has said that up to 100 Conservative MPs could end up supporting the Out campaign in a future referendum, including a number of current Cabinet ministers. More than 130 Conservative councillors have warned the prime minister risks splitting the party unless he accepts his renegotiation has failed and he campaigns for Britain to leave the EU.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-13,Bercow's entertainment bill revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35559244,"Commons Speaker John Bercow has spent thousands of pounds on entertaining other MPs and foreign politicians since April 2012, including £1,600 on a lunch for his Lithuanian counterpart. The Press Association has published details of expenditure from Mr Bercow's official House account, obtained under Freedom of Information rules.It includes £1,023 for beeswax candles and £286 to tune a grand piano.The Speaker's office said spending was 19% lower than under his predecessor. Mr Bercow has been Speaker since 2009, when he replaced Michael Martin - who stepped down amid the Commons expenses scandal.He is not subject to such stringent rules on expenses as other MPs, whose claims for food and drink are capped. MPs travelling outside their constituency on parliamentary business can claim £25 a day on food and drink, excluding alcohol. According to the Press Association, Mr Bercow spent £2,223.34 on a dinner for the ""panel of chairs"" - a group of MPs who chair public bill committees - in January 2010. In 2015, he spent £2,057 on a dinner to mark the retirement of former Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Dawn Primarolo.Up to £7,400 has been charged to the taxpayer, since 2012, on annual receptions for members of Parliament following the State Opening of Parliament while £3,000 was spent on a reception for new MPs in July 2015.Spending on functions for foreign parliamentarians are also recorded in the figures. A lunch for the Romanian Speaker in December 2012 cost £1,521.37 while a similar event for the Slovenian Speaker a year later cost £1,444.74.A dinner in honour of the Australian Speaker in May 2014 cost £1,954.38.Other miscellaneous items of spending included £286 on tuning the grand piano in Speaker's House which is ""available for members to use upon request"". Official postcard-size portrait photographs of the Speaker and senior officials taken at the State Opening of Parliament, which are available ""on request"", cost £307 to produce in November 2014 and £210 in December 2012.An order for ""hand-finished"" beeswax candles was made in July 2012, to be used for official gatherings in the State Rooms.A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said they were not querying the figures but defended the outlay, saying every Speaker in modern times has hosted receptions for MPs after the State Opening and the cost of doing so had fallen by 77% since 2009.She said it was ""long-established practice"" for the Speaker to pay for drinks ahead of the panel of chairs' annual dinner, which he did not routinely attend, while the Speaker was traditionally expected to host occasions for foreign dignitaries and to mark the departure of retiring and new MPs.She said the Speaker was committed to cutting costs wherever possible and total spending by the Speaker's Office had fallen from £626,029 in 2009-10, the year in which he was elected, to £504,737 in 2014-15.""These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure including, among other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office,"" she said.The Press Association said the Commons was unable to supply any information prior to April 2012 since it had been ""destroyed in accordance with the parliamentary records disposal policy"". Pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance said no-one ""begrudged"" the Speaker for footing the bill for official functions he was responsible for hosting and it was encouraging that overall spending by his office had fallen. But it said all spending by the Speaker's office should be made public as a matter of course so it could be subject to ""proper scrutiny"".Details of Mr Bercow's travel expenses are published every year. Between April 2014 and April 2015, he claimed more than £31,000 in travel and accommodation expenses, figure published last July showed."
2016-02-13,World powers agree Syria war pause plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35556783,"World powers have agreed to seek a nationwide ""cessation of hostilities"" in Syria to begin in a week's time, after talks in Munich, Germany. The halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.The 17-member International Syria Support Group (ISSG) also agreed to accelerate and expand aid deliveries.The announcement comes as the Syrian army, backed by Russian air strikes, advances in Aleppo province.The move threatens to encircle tens of thousands of civilians in rebel-held parts of the major city of Aleppo.The Syrian government has not yet responded, though a key rebel coalition welcomed the announcement.""If we see action and implementation on the ground, we will be soon in Geneva,"" Salim al-Muslat told reporters, referring to the Swiss city where the UN is trying to get peace talks between the Syrian government and rebels off the ground.More than 250,000 people have been killed and 13.5 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.Both Sergei Lavrov and John Kerry admitted, repeatedly, this was only progress on paper. Some diplomats are already saying ""it's not worth the paper it's printed on"".There are still major gaps. One of the biggest is that Russia's bombing of Aleppo and what it calls terrorist targets is not included in the possible truce even though its actions are seen by many as strengthening Syrian government forces. On the issue of delivering desperately needed aid to besieged areas, UN officials say they are determined to seize this new opening. The next week will confirm whether Syria's government and opposition forces are ready to provide access denied for so long.  It will be a week which tests the commitment of all outside players, as well as Syrians on all sides. That, in itself, is some progress. But moving towards talks to end Syria's devastating war will still take far more than that. US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted the ceasefire plan was ""ambitious"" and said the real test would be whether the various parties honoured the commitments. ""What we have here are words on paper, what we need to see in the next few days are actions on the ground,"" he said. A task force chaired by the US and Russia will work to implement the truce through consultations with Syria's rival groups. Aid deliveries for besieged Syrian communities are due to begin as early as Friday.To try to immediately step up aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in SyriaFor a US/Russia-led task force to work to achieve a ""cessation of hostilities"" across Syria beginning in one week's time""Cessation of hostilities"" will exclude action against so-called Islamic State group, jihadist group al-Nusra Front and other UN-designated terrorist groupsTo work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in SyriaMr Kerry made the announcement alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.Mr Lavrov said there were ""reasons to hope we have done a great job today"". An earlier proposal from Russia envisaged a truce starting on 1 March.At the news conference Mr Kerry again suggested that Russian strikes were targeting what the West sees as moderate opposition forces, rather than terrorists, as Moscow says.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the cessation would only work if Russia halted its raids, although Mr Lavrov said they would continue.The ISSG also agreed that peace talks involving the Syrian government and rebels should resume as soon as possible.Initial talks were suspended just days after they began earlier this month in Geneva, in the wake of the Aleppo offensive.Thousands of people displaced by the fighting have been stranded at the border with Turkey and aid agencies have warned of a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.Why is there a war in Syria?Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.Who is fighting whom?Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. How has the world reacted?Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes."
2016-02-13,MP takes up motorway sausage offer,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-35559712,"Liz Truss has taken up ""one of the best offers she has had all year"" - a sausage at a service station on the M5.To howls of laughter in the Commons, the environment secretary was promised a ""warm welcome and a Gloucester Old Spot sausage"" by MP Richard Graham if she ever visited Gloucester Services.The M5 stop-off spot aims to defy the usual reputation of a motorway services by offering upmarket organic fare.On Friday she took up the offer, proclaiming her sausage as ""very nice"".Gloucester MP Mr Graham made the offer during a Parliamentary debate last week about the role of the Great British Food Unit. Unveiled by Ms Truss in November, the unit brings together ""food and drink pioneers"" with the aim of helping Britain to become a ""great food nation"". During the 4 February debate, Mr Graham told his Conservative colleague that his constituency was not only home to ""some of the greatest food"" in the world, but said the M5 service station had been described as ""probably the best"" in the United Kingdom.Tucking in to a cooked breakfast with all the trimmings on Friday morning, Ms Truss said she enjoyed the ""really lovely"" sausage, although she had not been ""expecting such a huge plate of food"".""It's very, very tasty, it's local and you can see the passion of the producers who make it,"" she said of the sausage, made from Gloucestershire Old Spot meat.She added that Gloucester Services was ""a brilliant example of promoting local food, bringing together local producers to something that is an amazing experience to all the visitors that come here"".Opened in May 2014, Gloucester Services features independent shops and restaurants selling produce from 130 local suppliers from within a 30-mile (50km) radius."
2016-02-13,New offer in fiscal framework talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35561614,"Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney has submitted a fresh proposal in talks to establish a ""fiscal framework"" for new devolved powers.The Scottish and UK governments have been locked in talks about a financial deal, with deadlines pushed back due to disagreements over key terms.Prime Minister David Cameron has said the deal needs to be fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK.Mr Swinney said UK taxpayers would ""not lose a single penny"" under his plans.The fiscal framework is the financial structure which will underpin new powers being devolved north of the border as part of the Scotland Bill.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon dismissed the Treasury's previous offer on the matter as resulting in an ""almost £3bn cut"" for the Scottish budget.The two parties disagree on a principle called for by the Smith Commission on new powers for Scotland known as ""no detriment"", which underlines that neither the Scottish or UK budgets should suffer from the terms agreed upon.However, they disagree on what form this should take, particularly over the matter of population growth. Scotland's population is expected to grow more slowly than that of the UK in the coming years, which could impact on the economy north of the border. Ms Sturgeon said the Treasury seemed to be trying to argue in terms of what detriment should be imposed on Scotland, and her spokesman later described the UK government's position on the matter as ""increasingly isolated"".Outlining his latest proposal to his Treasury counterpart Greg Hands, Mr Swinney said taxpayers in the rest of the UK ""are no better or worse off"" under his terms.He said: ""Under the Scottish government's method, taxpayers in the rest of the UK will see no detriment. They do not lose a single penny under these plans. ""And it will ensure that the Scottish budget bears the risk of population changes relative to the rest of the UK via the Barnett formula.""In line with the Smith agreement, the Scottish budget will bear the full financial costs or reap the full rewards of decisions taken here in Scotland. And our proposals will see Scotland bear the economic risk of delivering growth, via tax receipts.""This proposal addresses each of the specific technical concerns the UK government has raised publicly and privately. Agreement on indexation would allow us to focus on agreeing the remaining outstanding matters under the Fiscal Framework.""I hope we now have the basis of a deal.""Mr Cameron told MPs at his weekly questions session that no-one was ""keener"" than he was to reach an agreement on the deal, adding that ""there has to be fairness across the rest of the UK too"".However, in a letter to Ms Sturgeon he warned that the Scottish government must ""be prepared to move towards us"" to reach a compromise agreement.The prime minister said it would be ""very difficult"" for him to ""explain to taxpayers in the rest of the UK that Scotland will stop paying income tax into the central pot yet somehow still receive a share of it"".Holyrood's devolution committee has called for both sides to give a ""full explanation of their position on a fiscal framework"" by 23 February, when they will be called to give evidence before MSPs.Convener Bruce Crawford said there would be ""very substantial impacts"" on the Scottish Parliament's ability to scrutinise the deal before dissolution on 23 March if a deal is not struck soon."
2016-02-13,Firms forced to reveal gender pay gap,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35553573,"Companies that fail to address pay differences between male and female employees will be highlighted in new league tables under plans announced on Friday.Those with more than 250 employees will be forced to reveal their pay gap. The regulations will affect about 8,000 employers across the UK.They will need to start calculating the pay gap from April 2017 - 12 months ahead of the first tables being published.Latest figures suggest that women in the UK still earn on average 20% less than men. Under the plans announced by Women and Equalities Minister Nicky Morgan, private companies and voluntary organisations will be required to reveal the number of men and women in each pay range to show where pay gaps are at their widest.  Employers must also publish their gender pay gap on their websites. They will have to report every year and senior executives will be expected to sign off the figures personally.Ms Morgan said that women and men must be recognised equally and fairly in every workplace so there was ""nowhere for gender inequality to hide"".""I'm calling on women across Britain to use their position as employees and consumers to demand more from businesses, ensuring their talents are given the recognition and reward they deserve,"" she said.Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said that league tables should not be used to ""name and shame"" firms, because data could only give a partial picture - factors such as the mix of part-time and full-time workers, as well as sectoral differences, needed to be taken into account.""Where reporting can be useful is as a prompt for companies to ask the right questions about how they can eradicate the gender pay gap,"" she said.  ""The government should consult closely with business to ensure that this new legislation helps close the gender pay gap, rather than ending up as a box-ticking exercise.""How equal are you? Click through to find out how your country ranks for gender equalityHowever, Chartered Management Institute chief executive Ann Francke argued: ""Publishing league tables will drive diversity, bringing benefits not just to women but to business. Closing the pay gap will open the talent pipeline, increase management quality and boost productivity.""And the TUC said the plans did not go far enough. ""We're disappointed that firms won't have to publish their gender pay gap figures until 2018,"" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary.""It is a real shame that bosses won't be made to explain why pay gaps exist in their workplaces and what action they will take to narrow them.""That sentiment was echoed by Kate Green, the shadow minister for women and equality. ""At this rate, it will be another 47 years until the gap is closed, so we haven't a moment to lose,"" she said.Last summer, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to end the gender pay gap within a generation.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in November that the gap between men and women's pay for full-time workers was 9.4% in April 2015, compared with 9.6% in 2014.The government hopes to tackle the root causes by encouraging more girls to study maths and science over the next five years. Regina Moran, the chief executive of Fujitsu UK and Ireland, said many businesses had a cultural problem: ""It's important that companies eliminate any biased pay structures within the organisation. But differences in pay are often part of a wider context, as businesses fail to create environments that support women in the long term. ""Firms must also be aware of and eliminate any subliminal bias in hiring, promotions and pay rises."""
2016-02-13,'Lack of interest' in rail franchises,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35556870,"Taxpayers could end up out of pocket because not enough private firms want to bid to run rail franchises in England and Wales, MPs have warned.A lack of competition between companies bidding to operate routes could mean the government struggles to get value for money, a report by the Public Accounts Committee said.It urged ministers to develop an ""alternative commercial strategy"".The Department for Transport said it was ""working to actively seek"" bidders.MPs noted that the DfT - which is responsible for awarding rail franchises in England and Wales to private sector companies - requires at least three bids per franchise to ""create competitive tension"".However, the committee said there are signs that interest is ""dwindling"" among companies willing to make an offer.MPs expressed concern about the DfT's competition-led approach to franchising, warning there was ""a real risk to value for money"" if market interest declined any further.The report urged ministers to develop an alternative commercial strategy to be used if competition for franchises continues to fall and suggested looking at other markets where competition is low, such as energy, to see if lessons could be learned.The report said the first five franchises to be made available after the government's bidding programme was restarted in 2013 attracted three bids each. It compared with an average of four for the previous 10 rounds of bidding.There are 15 franchises in England and Wales which each give companies the right to run passenger services in a particular area for a specified period. They are awarded following a tendering process that involves the DfT asking for expressions of interest before it consults with the public and ultimately selects an operator from a short list of companies bidding for the contract. Last week, it was announced that two companies will compete to run the South Western franchise from next summer.Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""This hardly inspires confidence and highlights the urgent need for the department to develop new approaches it can draw on when there is a risk competition will not deliver the result rail users and the wider public deserve.""The committee said it was often cheaper for firms to compete for bus services or to bid for franchises in Europe.It concluded that it was ""not clear"" when rail users would see higher quality services and urged the DfT to develop partnerships with operators that ""facilitate innovation"".The DfT said it had introduced ""a series of measures which has brought new companies to the market"".""We have 11 owning groups already able to bid for franchises and we are working to actively seek further new entrants to the market,"" a spokesman said.Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, described the committee's findings as ""hopelessly inadequate"" and claimed rail franchising was ""actually far worse than it was in 2012"".Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow rail minister, said the ""damning report"" showed rail franchising ""isn't delivering for passengers"" and is ""broken"".He called on the government to provide a ""real alternative that would extend public ownership as franchises expire and put passengers first"".Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators and Network Rail, said: ""We support the need for a clear vision for the whole of Britain's railway network.""The independent passenger watchdog Transport Focus said it was important passengers' needs and priorities were built into each franchise contract."

2016-02-13,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen.

She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip.

However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-13,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-13,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-13,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-13,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-13,'Unity reshuffle?',https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35545830,"They'll laugh it off for now, as governments always do. But as the prime minister enters this last week of negotiation before the crunch EU summit in Brussels next week, ministers' minds are turning to what happens in the aftermath, not just of the summit, but the referendum itself. And while Number 10 won't countenance any discussion of moves for its top team, several sources have told me that a reshuffle following a theoretical government victory in the referendum is very much on the cards. One source told me a ""unity reshuffle"" is being planned, to pull the party back together after the campaign to show that the Conservatives had a debate about Europe, and it was not a disaster. One senior minister told me ""there is bound to be"" a reorganisation, and maybe quite a big one, of the senior team. And it could be David Cameron's most wide-ranging reshuffle ever. He has never been fond of moving ministers around - reshuffles are notoriously hard to get right - and he's believed it makes sense to allow ministers time to master their brief, well at least not be shoved out at the first sign of trouble. Even after the general election, he left his senior team relatively intact. But after a very unusual permitted period of disagreement during the referendum campaign, a reshuffle where Eurosceptics are embraced, even promoted, could be used to show that the government can move forward as a team. A senior minister said there will be an ""overarching need to bring the party together to govern"". There are many moving parts to all of this. It's not even clear yet which ministers will declare for the Eurosceptic cause, although you'd get a decent bet on Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, Theresa Villiers, John Whittingdale, Michael Gove and still possibly Sajid Javid. And then there's even Mayor of London Boris Johnson. And of course it is not at all certain that the pro EU side of the argument will win the referendum. If David Cameron loses, all bets are off, and his job might even be on the line. But if he wins, and this reshuffle comes to pass, who might go where? Well, there would likely be a senior job for Boris Johnson, maybe as home secretary or even defence secretary with a move in turn, for Theresa May, perhaps to the Foreign Office. Mr Johnson turned down a Cabinet job after the general election, but the prime minister has promised there will be another offer. Michael Fallon, the current defence secretary, could replace Chris Grayling as leader of the House of Commons. It's likely too that there would be another senior woman promoted into the Cabinet, perhaps Anna Soubry or Priti Patel. None of this, of course, is certain. Politics is in a strangely febrile place, and it would be foolhardy to predict much about the next few months with much conviction. Downing Street sources say it's nonsense to suggest they are putting time and energy into planning a reshuffle. The focus is all on the renegotiation, then winning the referendum. Yet as ministers make their minds up which side to take in the campaign, don't doubt that their futures after the public vote are just as much of a preoccupation as the principles of stay or go. "
2016-02-13,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands. Randolph was heard to say: ""I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."""

2016-02-13,Labour's bomb,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35371074,"Clement Attlee is revered on the left as the father of the NHS and the welfare state. What is less celebrated, but no less true, is his role as the father of Britain's nuclear bomb.It was Attlee, as Labour's post-war prime minister, who made sure Britain got its own ""nuclear deterrent"", committing millions to its development at a time when the country was technically bankrupt.He did it in secret, without a debate in Parliament or the Labour Party, partly out of a desire to avoid damaging rows. The rows would come soon enough - and are continuing to split the party more than 70 years later, as Jeremy Corbyn wrestles with the seemingly impossible task of reconciling its pro and anti-nuclear factions.Attlee had his reasons for wanting Britain to become a nuclear-armed nation. He had just been elected prime minister when America dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in August 1945. He realised in an instant that the air raid wardens and fire engines that had fought to limit the damage done by Nazi bombs, were now useless in the face of the awesome destructive power of this new weapon. The only way to protect the population, he reasoned, was to have the ability to fight back.""The answer to an atomic bomb on London is an atomic bomb on another great city,"" he wrote in a secret memo to a cabinet committee 22 days after Hiroshima.This is the concept of a nuclear deterrent and ""mutually assured destruction"" in embryo.But Attlee was no warmonger. He wanted to rid the world of the menace of nuclear war by handing control of the weapons to the United Nations, even arguing that information about the bomb should be shared with the Soviet Union.""He immediately recognised the potential importance of nuclear weapons both for the conduct of war and for the conduct of international relations,"" wrote Len Scott, former professor of international history at Aberystwyth University in an essay on Labour and the bomb.But at the same time, added Prof Scott, he believed that Britain must have its own bomb, a need that became more pressing when the Americans passed a law, in August 1946, preventing it from sharing atomic secrets with other nations, including its closest wartime allies Britain and Canada, whose scientists had worked alongside the Americans to develop the Hiroshima bomb at Los Alamos.Debate raged in cabinet committees between those, like Chancellor Hugh Dalton, who argued that Britain could not afford a bomb, or the new V-force aircraft needed to deliver it, and those who argued that the country needed to keep its place at the top table and avoid being humiliated by the Americans.""We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs,"" foreign secretary, and former trade union leader, Ernest Bevin, is reported to have told one committee. ""We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.""A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacementIs there such a thing as a nuclear button?How important is Trident to the UK's security and international standing?Bevin's national prestige argument won the day - and it would surface again in 1957, when left-winger Aneurin Bevan surprised supporters by hitting back at calls for Britain to get rid of it nuclear weapons by telling that year's party conference the unilateralists were gripped by an ""an emotional spasm"" that would send a future Labour foreign secretary ""naked into the conference chamber"". Labour's leadership argued at the time that Britain should only abandon its weapons if it could persuade other countries, such as China and France, to do likewise (persuading the Soviet Union and the US to disarm was seen as a non-starter).But the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), formed in 1957, was growing in influence within the party, making the argument on moral grounds against weapons of mass destruction, with the Hydrogen bomb, a vastly more powerful weapon, recently tested by Britain, looming over the debate.CND's calls for Britain to unilaterally scrap its weapons briefly became party policy, before being overturned at the 1961 conference.Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson fought the 1964 general election questioning Britain's nuclear deterrent, declaring in Labour's manifesto that Polaris, American nuclear weapons to be fitted to British-built submarines under an agreement brokered by Tory PM Harold Macmillan, ""will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter"".  Attlee was even wheeled out, in a party election broadcast, to denounce the independent deterrent as a ""nonsense"".But the manifesto did not include an explicit commitment to abandon Polaris, just reassess the deal with the Americans, and although Wilson reduced the number of submarines from five to four, and brokered a non-proliferation treaty, Polaris became operational in 1968, beginning the round-the-clock patrols that continue to this day.The left felt betrayed by Wilson and when Labour unexpectedly went into opposition after the 1970 general election the party renewed its commitment to scrap Polaris and end moves towards a new generation of nuclear weapons, neither of which it did when it returned to power in 1974.When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979, the nuclear issue erupted with renewed ferocity in the Labour Party, against a backdrop of escalating tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union.It had now become a hugely symbolic issue for the party, a key dividing line between the left and right, who would eventually break away to form their own party, the SDP, to fight the 1983 general election. Then Labour leader Michael Foot, a founder member of CND, was a unilateralist, who also vowed to remove US nuclear weapons from British soil. His successor Neil Kinnock, was also a unilateralist, although he would drop the policy after losing the 1987 election, arguing that the best way to achieve a nuclear-free world was through negotiation between nuclear-armed nations.Kinnock had united the party behind scrapping nuclear weapons by arguing that the money spent on Trident - the replacement for Polaris - should go towards bolstering Britain's conventional forces instead, but he still faced accusations from the Conservatives that he was ""soft"" on defence and would make Britain a target for Soviet invasion. There were also questions about how Labour could scrap its weapons on moral grounds yet still expect to shelter under America's ""nuclear umbrella"" and how it could remain a member of nuclear-armed NATO.Tony Blair banished unilateralism from New Labour's vocabulary, along with other policies thought to be harming its credibility with centre ground voters. But the nuclear issue still had the power to split the party - in 2006 he faced his biggest rebellion since the Iraq war over plans to push ahead with a replacement for Trident, when 88 Labour MPs voted against the government. The backing of the Conservatives ensured Blair  won the vote convincingly. His argument to MPs was that Trident was the ""ultimate insurance"" and that it would be ""unwise and dangerous"" for Britain to unilaterally give up its nuclear capability.One of the rebels who spoke against Blair that night was veteran backbencher and CND stalwart Jeremy Corbyn, who quoted the mayor of Hiroshima in his speech, who had ""pleaded"" with Britain not to ""develop a new generation of nuclear missiles"".""We face an important decision tonight,"" said the Islington North MP. ""Either we endorse this vast expenditure, or we encourage a public debate that I believe will come down on the side of sanity, sense and peace in the world, and we do not go ahead with this vast expenditure that can lead only to a more dangerous world.""The idea that Corbyn would one day succeed Blair as Labour leader, and re-open the party's debate about unilateral disarmament, would have seemed pretty far-fetched to the MPs in the Commons chamber that night, including Corbyn himself. But he has now has the chance he has long craved to persuade the public of the ""sanity"" of his case.Labour has tended to be gripped by internal rows about scrapping nuclear weapons when it has been in opposition for some years, only to maintain the deterrent when it returns to power.But, as the party's resurgent unilateralists point out, this is the first time Labour has seriously debated the issue in a post-Cold War context. It is a very different world to the one facing Attlee in 1945.The challenge for Labour's defence review, headed by Emily Thornberry, is to avoid the Cold War thinking that still tends dominates both sides of the debate and see the issue with fresh eyes.Given the party's tortured history, that will not be easy."

The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.The Joint Parliamentary Committee makes 86 recommendations overall but the central thrust is that while the direction of the draft bill is broadly correct, the government still needs to make significant changes, particularly in making a number of provisions clearer.The bill aims to takes powers which were previously exercised using often obscure legal provisions and put them onto a clearer footing. But one of the most controversial provisions is a new power - to compel companies to keep Internet Connection Records (ICRs) for 12 months which detail the sites everyone visits on the web (although not what exact page). Not enough has been done to explain what is involved, the committee says. Law enforcement rather than spies are the chief sponsors of this provision and the committee gives them support for the overall concept (even adding that they could be expanded to identify people visiting websites which hold illegal material rather than just for identifying forms of communication). However, it says that more needs to be done on the detail. In particular there are problems over defining ICRs, over the technical feasibility of their collection and storage as well as the costs involved. All of this may make it challenging to deliver them in the timescale envisaged. Bulk Personal Datasets are another area of concern. Clear justifications and operational cases for why the powers are required remain lacking, the committee says, also criticising government for being unwilling to provide much detail of what kinds of datasets would be involved.Some might be obvious such as passport records but others - like health records - would be far more sensitive. It is notable in the report that the committee tried to get an answer on whether records such as health data would be excluded but was not given one by government.There is relatively little detail on the issue of encryption which has been of concern to many companies (notably Apple which submitted detailed evidence).A report from the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns from industry about the potential impact of ambiguity in some provisions. The indications are that the government wants to retain its right to seek unencrypted data even if it knows it may not always be possible to obtain it.  There are still some concerns from industry over what is meant when its said that companies need to take ""practicable"" steps to provide such data and what impact it has on end-to-end encryption systems. Some companies also remain concerned they could be compelled to hack into their own products under equipment interference provisions.The Joint Committee also calls for some significant changes to the way in which judges provide oversight over powers to increase independence. On intelligence sharing, the Joint Committee also notably calls for it to be made illegal to get another country to spy on behalf of a UK agency or body when it does not have the authorisation to collect such information. The legislation is often technical by necessity and so a lot of weight is placed on ""codes of practice"" which outline how exactly the powers should be used. The committee say these should be published along with the bill to provide greater transparency and clarity.The Intelligence and Security Committee report earlier in the week focused more narrowly on intelligence agency powers but took a tougher line. It criticised the lack of an over-arching privacy protection and also said that when challenged about what the power of bulk equipment interference actually involved, officials were unable to provide an answer. The committee have rejected the idea of a sunset clause in which the powers would expire after five years instead calling for a joint committee to review the use of the powers as the five year point approached.There were clearly differences of opinion within the committee and despite the huge amount of evidence it took, some still feel it may have had to rush. One member, Lord Strasburger argued the government had not learnt the lesson of drafting a bill too broadly and said that essential information was missing that parliament needed in order to decide if the powers were necessary and proportionate. The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year."
2016-02-13,Sovereign strategies,https://web.archive.org//web/20160214033048/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35539860,"Governments rarely perform miracles but they do try to square circles. And that is what David Cameron's ministers are attempting right now with Britain's constitution.They are looking for a way of asserting the sovereignty and authority of parliament over the EU in a way that convinces voters - and Boris Johnson - that Britain's relationship with the continent is changing.But they need to do this without claiming that UK law has primacy over EU law, something that would be tantamount to leaving the EU. As you might imagine, this is not proving an easy piece of constitutional carpentry.Clever minds in Whitehall are looking at two potential options, both of which would involve parliament giving greater authority to the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.One option would involve the Supreme Court assessing decisions by the ECJ and considering whether they breach the fundamental principles of Britain's constitutional norms that have been laid down over the centuries in various Acts of Parliament and common law. This would follow a similar path to the German constitutional court which can assess whether ECJ decisions challenge Germany's constitution.The problem with this option, of course, is that Britain does not have a single, codified constitution and so legal comparisons would be complex to say the least. And there is also the small problem that placing British constitutional traditions ahead of EU law would effectively leave the UK in breach of the many treaties it has signed over the years as a member of the European Union. If you don't sign up to the club rules, you can't be a member of the club.So a second option is being considered that some see as being perhaps more feasible. This would again involve parliament beefing up the authority of the Supreme Court to question rulings coming from the European Court of Justice. But - and here's the clever part - the Supreme Court would do this only in exceptional circumstances if it thought the judges in Luxembourg were breaching not UK law, but EU law.Crucially, the Supreme Court would not be questioning the supremacy of EU law. It would simply be ensuring that the UK obeyed the EU treaties which it had signed up to, rather than how those treaties were being interpreted by judges in Luxembourg. Now this might sound mad, or at the very least counter-intuitive. But national courts like the UK Supreme Court have already questioned what some see as the ""judicial activism"" of the European Court of Justice. Some courts think that the ECJ has on occasion exceeded its jurisdiction and made judgements that are not based on EU treaties.In a case last year, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether Home Secretary Theresa May was legally able to deprive a Vietnamese man of his UK citizenship because he was considered by the security services to be a threat to national security.The European Court of Justice has in various judgements challenged such decisions because it believes that EU citizenship is dependent on national citizenship and therefore it has a right to poke its nose in decisions like this.But the Supreme Court questioned this judicial activism which it considered was not based on any EU treaty text. In a judgement on the so-called Pham case, on 25 March 2015, the judges said in, paragraph 90:""A domestic court faces a particular dilemma if, in the face of the clear language of a Treaty and of associated declarations and decisions, such as those mentioned in paras 86-89, the Court of Justice reaches a decision which oversteps jurisdictional limits which Member States have clearly set at the European Treaty level and which are reflected domestically in their constitutional arrangements. But, unless the Court of Justice has had conferred upon it under domestic law unlimited as well as unappealable power to determine and expand the scope of European law, irrespective of what the Member States clearly agreed, a domestic court must ultimately decide for itself what is consistent with its own domestic constitutional arrangements, including in the case of the 1972 Act what jurisdictional limits exist under the European Treaties and upon the competence conferred on European institutions including the Court of Justice.""Now that might read as a lot of rather wordy legalese but it is in fact the highest court of the land very gently and very politely telling its counterpart in Luxembourg to go stick. This led the legal expert, Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, to conclude in a lecture on November 2015 that:""There is no doubt that some of the case-law of the Court of Justice has been regarded by the supreme courts of Member States as exceeding the jurisdiction conferred upon it, and in so doing encroaching in an unauthorised way upon the national legal systems. UK judges have expressed concerns of precisely this kind. In my mind they have been right to do so.""He added: ""Leaving the protection of the UK constitution to UK judges is not necessarily at odds with the UK government considering whether something further might be done in support of the role of the national judiciary. That ""something further"" might include providing statutory recognition of the limits of EU law supremacy under the European Communities Act. It is understandable that the prime minister might think that the present is an appropriate time for review of the UK constitutional position.""And Professor Wyatt is not alone. Anthony Speaight QC, who served on the government's Commission on a UK Bill of Rights, gave evidence to MPs on the All Party Group on the Rule of Law this month and he told them in a written submission:""It would do no violence to UK legal principles, and arguably would be to perfect and enhance them, if Parliament were to amend (section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972) to clarify that the domestic courts are not to enforce EU instruments and decisions if they find them to be outside EU competences, and that ECJ decisions as to whether acts are within or without competence are to be no more than persuasive authority.""Mr Speaight accepted that such a power would be ""a nuclear weapon"" that the Supreme Court would be reluctant to use. But he concluded:""It might be judged that the theoretical existence of the review in the hands of a court with so high an international reputation as the UK Supreme Court would act as a salutary warning to EU institutions to respect the limits of competence and subsidiarity.""Now this option, of beefing up the powers of the Supreme Court, is not without its problems. Some lawyers argue that there is no distinction between EU treaties and how the ECJ interprets those treaties.  The former attorney general Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One his week that the attempt was pointless because ultimately the ECJ has the final say. Some MPs think that judge-led law is just as bad coming from the UK Supreme Court as it is from the European Court. And politically there is no guarantee that a rarely-used constitutional long-stop would be enough to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU. But, right now, it appears to be the only game in town and it is the one the government is playing. "

""There are still a lot of moving parts,"" Mr Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""We've got a negotiation that will run through this week and, I have no doubt, will run right to the wire.""Mr Hammond said the draft deal contains lots of ""square brackets"", ""blanks"" and ""unclear language"", but added a final agreement should provide ""clear winds for Britain on national sovereignty"".Mr Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU by the end of 2017 but could bring the date forward if a deal is reached this week. Among the four main changes Mr Cameron is trying to secure is limiting access to welfare benefits for EU migrants for their first four years in the country.""Until a few weeks ago, people were telling us it was impossible to have any kind of period in which we treated newly arrived migrants differently from people who are already here,"" he said.""But the text that's on the table recognises there can be a period of four years in which people are treated differently.""That's a major step forward. What we have still got to discuss is what that difference in treatment precisely is... I don't think that is going to get resolved before Thursday.""EU referendum: US wants 'strong UK in strong EU'Guide: All you need to know about the referendumAsked whether a one-year ban on in-work benefits for migrants would be enough to satisfy his party, Mr Hammond replied: ""Definitely not.""He went on: ""Getting agreement that we can treat new arrivals differently for a period of four years is a major breakthrough in challenging, as we have done, one of the sacred cows of European ideology.""Mr Hammond said the government was ""still arguing"" that treaty change would be the best way of cementing a new relationship with the EU. But Mr Hammond said it was not essential, if European heads of government signed a binding agreement.""Even if treaty change is agreed, it will be years before that treaty change comes into force,"" he said. ""And once this [deal on Thursday] is agreed we need to see it implemented as quickly as possible.""Eurosceptic Labour MP Gisela Stuart said the EU project ""was always deeper integration"" and Mr Cameron had not been ambitious enough in the reforms he had sought over membership. ""The bar he set himself was exceptionally low,"" she told Marr. ""My instincts are this simply isn't good enough and won't serve the British people.""Ms Stuart said she thought voting in the referendum over whether to stay in the EU or leave would ""not fall along party lines"". ""We will go into the referendum with people coming from all sides and voting in pretty unpredictable ways,"" she said.Asked about Syria, Mr Hammond accused Russia of ""carpet bombing tactics"" and carrying out ""indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas"".Russia denies hitting civilians and has said it will continue its air attacks, which it says target only ""terrorists"".On the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Mr Hammond said the key question was ""whether the Russians are prepared to use their influence to remove him"". ""There is one man on this planet who can end the civil war in Syria by making a phone call and that's President [Vladimir] Putin.""Mr Hammond said Russian air strikes were causing ""attrition"" among rebel groups but that the conflict overall was in ""a bit of a stalemate"". Russian air power was forcing opposition forces to give ground but the Syrian government was unable to take and hold that territory, he added.Mr Hammond said the number of ""moderate"" opposition fighters now stood at 150,000. ""I wouldn't call them all democratic,"" he said.Russia has said other countries should join it in backing the Syrian government.Mr Hammond's comments come after three days of talks among foreign ministers in Munich about prospects for peace in Syria. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says that with President Assad and three mainstream rebel groups all vowing to carry on fighting, talks are ""in practice, back where they started"". "

He held the seat for eight years, moving to the Lords in 1971 when he inherited the title of Baron Avebury. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron paid tribute to a ""true Liberal"", ""great campaigner"" and ""committed internationalist"". Lord Avebury: ObituaryMr Farron  said the peer, who had been suffering from leukaemia, would ""be remembered as much for his unyielding commitment to fighting for Liberal causes as his sensational by-election victory"".""He campaigned to lower the voting age, founded the parliamentary human rights group and fought for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, taking up the cases of hundreds of individuals fleeing persecution.""He was a committed internationalist, regularly promoting human rights around the world. The Liberal Democrats have lost a great campaigner, a great friend and a true champion of the Liberal cause."" A Buddhist, Lord Avebury was the patron of Angulimala, which promotes the teaching and practice of Buddhism in British prisons. He also campaigned on behalf of secular causes, fighting to remove mandatory daily worship in maintained schools.In 2009, the National Secular Society named the peer secularist of the year, jointly with Evan Harris, for his work on abolition of blasphemy laws in England and Wales.His biography on the Lib Dem website says he also ""sought and won"" a battle with the senior parliamentary official known as Black Rod to keep the right to park bicycles against the front of the Houses of Parliament.Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, said Lord Avebury had supported countless human rights campaigns. ""His knowledge of foreign affairs, particularly of remote parts of the developing world, was second to none. The weak and oppressed in these places have lost a true champion.""I have lost a very close friend. The nation has lost a human rights champion."""
2016-02-14,'Final hurdle' in Scots fiscal talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35572700,"Representatives of the Scottish and UK governments are to meet for last-ditch talks to establish a fiscal framework for new devolved powers.Finance Secretary John Swinney said he hoped a deal could be done this week.Holyrood's devolution committee has set a deadline of 23 February if there is to be time to scrutinise the agreement.Mr Swinney's Treasury counterpart Greg Hands warned that walking away from a deal would be ""letting down the people of Scotland"".The two sides both tabled fresh proposals in the deadlocked talks last week, with Mr Swinney warning that ""very significant issues"" remain.The parties disagree on their interpretation of the ""no detriment"" principle laid out by the Smith Commission on new powers for Scotland, which stipulates that neither the UK or the Scottish budgets should be left worse off by a deal.Writing in the Scotland on Sunday newspaper, Mr Hands said both governments had ""shared an objective to make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved administrations in the world"".He said there remained an obstacle at the ""final hurdle"", saying the deal the Scottish government was proposing is ""not fair"".The key disagreement concerns population, with that of Scotland set to grow more slowly than that of the UK in coming years.The Scottish government backs a model known as ""per capita indexed deduction"", which would compensate financially for the slower population growth.Mr Swinney said this was the best way of satisfying the ""no detriment"" principle, but Mr Hands said it was ""not logical"" and instead proposes a model which would update Scotland's population share of tax revenue over time.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has exchanged letters with Prime Minister David Cameron on the matter, claimed the Treasury's position amounted to an ""almost £3bn cut"" for Scottish budgets over 10 years.Mr Cameron responded that it would be ""very difficult"" for him to to explain to taxpayers in the rest of the UK that ""Scotland would stop paying income tax into the central pot yet somehow still receive a share of it"".David Phillips, of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme that there would need to be ""goodwill"" on both sides just to reach a ""fudge"".He said: ""It's a very complicated picture, because of the 'no detriment' principles and taxpayer principles in the Smith Commission report.""You might think they are both very sensible principles, but it turns out with the Barnett Formula in place you can't have a system that satisfies both principles while being simple and transparent.""Mr Hands also said the UK government was unhappy about the Scottish government's proposal that it would set its own fiscal and economic forecasts.MSPs had called for the Scottish Fiscal Commission to be given the power to set forecasts instead, but SNP members on the finance committee backed down after hearing evidence from Mr Swinney.Holyrood's devolution committee wants both sides to present a ""full explanation of their position"" by its next meeting on 23 February, when they will be called to give evidence to MSPs.Convener Bruce Crawford has warned there would be ""very substantial impacts"" on the Scottish Parliament's ability to scrutinise the deal before dissolution on 23 March if a deal is not struck soon.Mr Swinney said: ""Our proposal is with the Treasury and I hope, and believe, we can now agree the remaining outstanding issues this week.""However, Mr Hands said ""the ball is fully in the court of the Scottish government"", adding: ""We must all hope they do not miss this opportunity""."

""Now obviously, the United States has a profound interest in your success as we do in a very strong United Kingdom staying in a strong EU.""Guide: All you need to know about the referendumLast year, US President Barack Obama said the UK must stay in the EU to continue to have influence on the world stage.A spokesman for Vote Leave, one of two groups vying to be the official Out campaign in the EU referendum, told the BBC the British government was ""pulling favours"" from world leaders.""The State Department has long thought the UK is better off in for US interests,"" he said.""But this vote is about the future of the British people and Britain's best interests and we're confident the British people will vote to take that control.""However, Britain Stronger In Europe - a group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU - said Mr Kerry's comments reinforce how Britain's ""global influence is clearly enhanced by staying in Europe"".Executive director Will Straw said: ""Being in an alliance with 27 other European democracies strengthens our hand when dealing with threats like terrorism and a resurgent Russia. And increases our clout and credibility in Washington.""In a speech to business, political and civic leaders in Hamburg, Mr Cameron said he would campaign ""unequivocally"" for the UK to stay in - if the EU agreed to the new terms of membership.While defending Britain's right to protect its sovereignty, he told his audience - which included German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that Britain was an ""open nation"" and he ""never wants us to pull up the drawbridge and retreat from the world"".""So when it comes to the question of Britain's future in Europe, my aim is clear,"" he said. ""I want to keep Britain inside a reformed European Union.""Mr Cameron also appealed for Germany's help in finalising reforms, stressing the countries' shared interests and values.Negotiations on the final wording of the deal - which includes an ""emergency brake"" on benefit payments to EU migrants and a UK opt-out from ""ever closer union"" - look set to carry on right up to the start of the Brussels summit on 18 February.Campaigners for an EU exit have said the draft deal, published earlier this month after months of negotiations between UK and EU officials, did not come close to the changes voters had been promised.No date has yet been announced for the referendum although Downing Street is reported to favour staging the poll in June.

2016-02-14,Trident 'lets UK punch above weight',https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35566480,"Britain must keep its Trident nuclear weapons system if it wants to play a significant role in the world, the US defence secretary has said.Ash Carter told the BBC it was an ""important part of the deterrent structure of Nato"" and allowed the UK to punch above its weight.  MPs are expected to vote this year on whether to back government plans to renew the UK's four Trident submarines.Labour is currently reviewing its support for the weapons.Renewing the Trident fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade, is estimated by the government to cost £31bn, although opponents claim the final bill will be far higher. Asked whether the UK should be investing in a new fleet of submarines amid stretched defence resources, Mr Carter replied unequivocally that it should. He said Trident aided the UK's ""special relationship"" with the US and helped it ""continue to play that outsized role on the global stage that it does because of its moral standing and its historical standing"". ""It's important that the military power matches that standing and so we're very supportive of it,"" he said.Mr Carter said the UK and US each had independent authority to use Trident but were ""dependent upon one another industrially"". ""We depend upon the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom depends on us, that's part of the special relationship,"" he told the BBC. ""We build joint strike fighters together, we build Trident missiles together.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a longstanding opponent of nuclear weapons and has commissioned a review by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry. But some of the party's MPs and peers have threatened to resign if it reverses its decades-long support for the missiles. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham, who backs renewal, recently indicated it may be ""impossible"" for Labour to reach an agreed position on Trident.The US defence secretary was asked about Ms Thornberry's suggestion that underwater drones could be able to detect submarines in future, making them vulnerable to attack and obsolete.Mr Carter, who this week attended a meeting with Nato defence ministers in Brussels, said the ability of submarines to ""operate stealthily"" was proven.""We are, in fact, making large investments in undersea forces because of their survive-ability, as well as their power,"" he said.Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.Four UK submarines carry up to eight Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads.A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacement"

""The allegations that were on Channel 4 News are, as far as I can see, completely unfounded,"" he added.Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.But Channel 4 News' political correspondent Michael Crick said he had uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.The programme found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.Michael Payne, who represented Labour in the Newark by-election, wrote to Nottinghamshire Police on Tuesday asking it to look into claims of ""undeclared"" spending by his rivals, saying he wanted reassurance that electoral laws and procedures had been complied with.

2016-02-14,GCHQ computer hacking ruled lawful,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35558349,"GCHQ is operating within the law when it hacks into computers and smart phones, a security tribunal has ruled.Campaigners Privacy International have lost a legal challenge claiming the spying post's hacking operations are too intrusive and break European law.The case was launched after revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of US and UK spying.GCHQ admitted its agents hack devices, in the UK and abroad, for the first time during the hearings.Its previous policy had been to ""neither confirm nor deny"" the existence of such operations.Hackers can remotely activate cameras and microphones on devices, without the owner's knowledge, log keystrokes, install malware, copy documents and track locations among other things, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) was told.The Home Office has now published a code of practice for hacking, or ""equipment interference"" as it is also known, and aims to put it on a firmer legal footing in its Investigatory Powers Bill, which is due to become law later this year.The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a panel of senior judges, said in its ruling that the code struck the right balance between the ""urgent need of the Intelligence Agencies to safeguard the public and the protection of an individual's privacy and/or freedom of expression"".But the judges were ""satisfied"" the agency was already operating in a lawful and proportionate way, whatever the outcome of Parliament's scrutiny of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Privacy International, which launched the legal challenge with seven internet service providers, said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and would continue to challenge ""state-sponsored hacking,"" which it said was ""incompatible with democratic principles and human rights standards"". Scarlet Kim, Privacy International's legal officer, said: ""Hacking is one of the most intrusive surveillance capabilities available to intelligence agencies. ""This case exposed not only these secret practices but also the undemocratic manner in which the government sought to backdate powers to do this under the radar. ""Just because the government magically produces guidelines for hacking should not legitimise this practice.""She added that hacking ""fundamentally weakens the security of computers and the internet"" by exploiting the ""weaknesses in software and hardware used by millions of people"". ""It is akin to unlocking a person's window without their knowledge and leaving it open for any attacker - whether GCHQ, another country's intelligence agency or a cyber criminal - to access.""Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond welcomed the tribunal's ruling.""The ability to exploit computer networks plays a crucial part in our ability to protect the British public,"" he said.""Once again, the law and practice around our Security and Intelligence Agencies' capabilities and procedures have been scrutinised by an independent body and been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.""The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will further strengthen the safeguards for the Agencies' use of these powers, including a new double-lock authorisation process. ""It will provide our Security and Intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats our country faces, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements."""
2016-02-14,RBS boss supports EU membership,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35559602,"The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland says he believes the UK financial sector would be better off inside the European Union.Speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight, Ross McEwan said the uncertainty caused by the EU vote could ""slow down banking"".He said he would like the referendum to be held as early as possible, ideally in June.Mr McEwan added that he does not expect an interest rate rise before 2017.The UK is due to hold a referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union, before the end of 2017.In an interview with Newsnight's Kirsty Wark Mr McEwan said he had seen no ""economic data that suggests we'd be better off out in the short to medium term"".He said unpredictability around the referendum was causing problems for the UK's banks.""The issue we've got is the uncertainty which slows businesses down, which will over time slow down banking so it's... really good that the government is trying to have the vote very quickly.""On interest rates, Mr McEwan said he sees no prospect of any rise from the Bank of England in the near future.""We're going to have lower interest rates for a lot longer than was anticipated… I don't think [we'll have rate rises] for all this year and possibly all of 2017 as well. ""We just have to get used to an environment where we have low interest rates for a long period of time.""Mr McEwan suggested RBS had turned a corner under his leadership, but that it was likely the firm would post its eighth consecutive years of losses later this month.The bank has set aside considerable sums to pay for US-imposed fines over mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and payment protection insurance (PPI) payments.In line with other banks the share price of RBS has declined by nearly 45% in a year. The firm remains largely in public hands, with the British government owning a 73% stake, after a £45bn ($65bn) bailout in 2008. Chancellor George Osborne sold 5% of its stake last August, making a loss. The share price has fallen still further since then. Asked if the British taxpayer is likely to get its £45bn back, Mr McEwan said: ""At this rate no… We'd love to get that money back to the public because it's the public's money. ""But at the time, if they hadn't saved RBS then a lot of the financial services in the UK would have probably collapsed.""The full interview with the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Ross McEwan will be broadcast on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 GMT on Friday 12 February.

2016-02-14,PM: UK will not 'retreat from world',https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35562698,"David Cameron has said Britain will never ""retreat from the world"" and it is in Europe's interests for the UK to stay in a reformed European Union.Speaking in Hamburg, the PM said changes he was seeking to UK membership would make Europe ""more outward-looking, competitive and dynamic"".He said if he got what he wanted he would campaign ""unequivocally"" for the UK to stay in.Campaigners for EU exit have said the PM's renegotiation is a sham.The prime minister is hoping for a deal at next week's summit of EU leaders in Brussels to allow him to put the new terms of membership to the British public in a referendum in June.But Donald Tusk, the European Council president who is brokering talks on the UK's renegotiation process, has warned that the political process remains ""very fragile"", with some leaders still harbouring reservations about the plan, particularly over limits on welfare payments to new EU migrants.In his final major speech before next week's crunch meeting, Mr Cameron told business, political and civic leaders in Hamburg that he made no apology for Britain being ""argumentative and rather strong-minded"" when it came to the subject of Europe.""We have the character of an island nation - independent, forthright, passionate in defence of our sovereignty - and of institutions that have served us well for many hundreds of years,"" he said.""And the need to protect our sovereignty has always been paramount for us.""But he told his audience at the Matthiae-Mahlzeit dinner - which included German Chancellor Angela Merkel - that Britain was an ""open nation"" and the values it shared with Germany underpinned their co-operation on trade, enterprise and security. Downing Street said the prime minister and Mrs Merkel also held a meeting - agreeing that EU countries and institutions needed to continue to work together to reach a deal on the UK's renegotiation.Other topics discussed included migration and implementing the £6.8bn in pledges made by countries at last week's London conference to help Syrians affected by the five-year conflict, a Number 10 spokesman said.David Cameron has been denounced by some of his own MPs for negotiating a ""threadbare"" deal, and more than 100 of his councillors are urging him to campaign to leave the EU. The tone of his speech in Hamburg suggests he will do no such thing - he pledged to campaign ""unequivocally"" for British membership on new terms, though included in his speech was his usual disclaimer that he ""rules nothing out"" until a deal is done.  We also got another glimpse of how the referendum will be fought - with a strong plea for Europe to ""stand together"" in an uncertain world.  But there was a recognition that he won't get everything he wants, when he said: ""Even when we have secured the changes I am arguing for, the job will not be done."" He portrayed Germany as an ally in arguing for further change but his opponents will pounce on this as evidence of the paucity of his demands. In his speech, Mr Cameron argued it was in the two countries' interests for the EU to become more competitive and for rules to ensure that both countries inside the eurozone and those outside could be mutually successful.""When Britain says we need to have a Europe that respects nation states and that we should be able to run our own welfare systems, those are calls which I believe resonate around Europe,"" he said.""So if by working together we can achieve these changes, then I will unequivocally recommend that Britain stays in a reformed European Union on these new terms. Of course, if we can't then I rule nothing out.""But I believe we can - and if we do, I believe we can win that referendum and that will be good for Britain, good for Germany and good for the whole of Europe.""Negotiations on the final wording of the deal - which includes an ""emergency brake"" on benefit payments to EU migrants and a UK opt-out from ""ever closer union"" - look set to carry on right up to the start of the summit on 18 February.A senior Tory backbencher has said that up to 100 Conservative MPs could end up supporting the Out campaign in a future referendum, including a number of current Cabinet ministers. More than 130 Conservative councillors have warned the prime minister risks splitting the party unless he accepts his renegotiation has failed and he campaigns for Britain to leave the EU.Guide: All you need to know about the referendumEU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?Referendum timeline: What will happen when?The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?More: BBC News EU referendum special"
2016-02-14,Bercow's entertainment bill revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35559244,"Commons Speaker John Bercow has spent thousands of pounds on entertaining other MPs and foreign politicians since April 2012, including £1,600 on a lunch for his Lithuanian counterpart. The Press Association has published details of expenditure from Mr Bercow's official House account, obtained under Freedom of Information rules.It includes £1,023 for beeswax candles and £286 to tune a grand piano.The Speaker's office said spending was 19% lower than under his predecessor. Mr Bercow has been Speaker since 2009, when he replaced Michael Martin - who stepped down amid the Commons expenses scandal.He is not subject to such stringent rules on expenses as other MPs, whose claims for food and drink are capped. MPs travelling outside their constituency on parliamentary business can claim £25 a day on food and drink, excluding alcohol. According to the Press Association, Mr Bercow spent £2,223.34 on a dinner for the ""panel of chairs"" - a group of MPs who chair public bill committees - in January 2010. In 2015, he spent £2,057 on a dinner to mark the retirement of former Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Dawn Primarolo.Up to £7,400 has been charged to the taxpayer, since 2012, on annual receptions for members of Parliament following the State Opening of Parliament while £3,000 was spent on a reception for new MPs in July 2015.Spending on functions for foreign parliamentarians are also recorded in the figures. A lunch for the Romanian Speaker in December 2012 cost £1,521.37 while a similar event for the Slovenian Speaker a year later cost £1,444.74.A dinner in honour of the Australian Speaker in May 2014 cost £1,954.38.Other miscellaneous items of spending included £286 on tuning the grand piano in Speaker's House which is ""available for members to use upon request"". Official postcard-size portrait photographs of the Speaker and senior officials taken at the State Opening of Parliament, which are available ""on request"", cost £307 to produce in November 2014 and £210 in December 2012.An order for ""hand-finished"" beeswax candles was made in July 2012, to be used for official gatherings in the State Rooms.A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said they were not querying the figures but defended the outlay, saying every Speaker in modern times has hosted receptions for MPs after the State Opening and the cost of doing so had fallen by 77% since 2009.She said it was ""long-established practice"" for the Speaker to pay for drinks ahead of the panel of chairs' annual dinner, which he did not routinely attend, while the Speaker was traditionally expected to host occasions for foreign dignitaries and to mark the departure of retiring and new MPs.She said the Speaker was committed to cutting costs wherever possible and total spending by the Speaker's Office had fallen from £626,029 in 2009-10, the year in which he was elected, to £504,737 in 2014-15.""These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure including, among other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office,"" she said.The Press Association said the Commons was unable to supply any information prior to April 2012 since it had been ""destroyed in accordance with the parliamentary records disposal policy"". Pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance said no-one ""begrudged"" the Speaker for footing the bill for official functions he was responsible for hosting and it was encouraging that overall spending by his office had fallen. But it said all spending by the Speaker's office should be made public as a matter of course so it could be subject to ""proper scrutiny"".Details of Mr Bercow's travel expenses are published every year. Between April 2014 and April 2015, he claimed more than £31,000 in travel and accommodation expenses, figure published last July showed."
2016-02-14,World powers agree Syria war pause plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35556783,"World powers have agreed to seek a nationwide ""cessation of hostilities"" in Syria to begin in a week's time, after talks in Munich, Germany. The halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.The 17-member International Syria Support Group (ISSG) also agreed to accelerate and expand aid deliveries.The announcement comes as the Syrian army, backed by Russian air strikes, advances in Aleppo province.The move threatens to encircle tens of thousands of civilians in rebel-held parts of the major city of Aleppo.The Syrian government has not yet responded, though a key rebel coalition welcomed the announcement.""If we see action and implementation on the ground, we will be soon in Geneva,"" Salim al-Muslat told reporters, referring to the Swiss city where the UN is trying to get peace talks between the Syrian government and rebels off the ground.More than 250,000 people have been killed and 13.5 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.Both Sergei Lavrov and John Kerry admitted, repeatedly, this was only progress on paper. Some diplomats are already saying ""it's not worth the paper it's printed on"".There are still major gaps. One of the biggest is that Russia's bombing of Aleppo and what it calls terrorist targets is not included in the possible truce even though its actions are seen by many as strengthening Syrian government forces. On the issue of delivering desperately needed aid to besieged areas, UN officials say they are determined to seize this new opening. The next week will confirm whether Syria's government and opposition forces are ready to provide access denied for so long.  It will be a week which tests the commitment of all outside players, as well as Syrians on all sides. That, in itself, is some progress. But moving towards talks to end Syria's devastating war will still take far more than that. US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted the ceasefire plan was ""ambitious"" and said the real test would be whether the various parties honoured the commitments. ""What we have here are words on paper, what we need to see in the next few days are actions on the ground,"" he said. A task force chaired by the US and Russia will work to implement the truce through consultations with Syria's rival groups. Aid deliveries for besieged Syrian communities are due to begin as early as Friday.To try to immediately step up aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in SyriaFor a US/Russia-led task force to work to achieve a ""cessation of hostilities"" across Syria beginning in one week's time""Cessation of hostilities"" will exclude action against so-called Islamic State group, jihadist group al-Nusra Front and other UN-designated terrorist groupsTo work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in SyriaMr Kerry made the announcement alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.Mr Lavrov said there were ""reasons to hope we have done a great job today"". An earlier proposal from Russia envisaged a truce starting on 1 March.At the news conference Mr Kerry again suggested that Russian strikes were targeting what the West sees as moderate opposition forces, rather than terrorists, as Moscow says.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the cessation would only work if Russia halted its raids, although Mr Lavrov said they would continue.The ISSG also agreed that peace talks involving the Syrian government and rebels should resume as soon as possible.Initial talks were suspended just days after they began earlier this month in Geneva, in the wake of the Aleppo offensive.Thousands of people displaced by the fighting have been stranded at the border with Turkey and aid agencies have warned of a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.Why is there a war in Syria?Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.Who is fighting whom?Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. How has the world reacted?Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes."

Unveiled by Ms Truss in November, the unit brings together ""food and drink pioneers"" with the aim of helping Britain to become a ""great food nation"". During the 4 February debate, Mr Graham told his Conservative colleague that his constituency was not only home to ""some of the greatest food"" in the world, but said the M5 service station had been described as ""probably the best"" in the United Kingdom.Tucking in to a cooked breakfast with all the trimmings on Friday morning, Ms Truss said she enjoyed the ""really lovely"" sausage, although she had not been ""expecting such a huge plate of food"".""It's very, very tasty, it's local and you can see the passion of the producers who make it,"" she said of the sausage, made from Gloucestershire Old Spot meat.She added that Gloucester Services was ""a brilliant example of promoting local food, bringing together local producers to something that is an amazing experience to all the visitors that come here"".Opened in May 2014, Gloucester Services features independent shops and restaurants selling produce from 130 local suppliers from within a 30-mile (50km) radius."

2016-02-14,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle.

2016-02-14,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-14,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-14,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-14,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."

2016-02-14,'Unity reshuffle?',https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35545830,"They'll laugh it off for now, as governments always do. But as the prime minister enters this last week of negotiation before the crunch EU summit in Brussels next week, ministers' minds are turning to what happens in the aftermath, not just of the summit, but the referendum itself. And while Number 10 won't countenance any discussion of moves for its top team, several sources have told me that a reshuffle following a theoretical government victory in the referendum is very much on the cards. One source told me a ""unity reshuffle"" is being planned, to pull the party back together after the campaign to show that the Conservatives had a debate about Europe, and it was not a disaster. One senior minister told me ""there is bound to be"" a reorganisation, and maybe quite a big one, of the senior team. And it could be David Cameron's most wide-ranging reshuffle ever. He has never been fond of moving ministers around - reshuffles are notoriously hard to get right - and he's believed it makes sense to allow ministers time to master their brief, well at least not be shoved out at the first sign of trouble. Even after the general election, he left his senior team relatively intact. But after a very unusual permitted period of disagreement during the referendum campaign, a reshuffle where Eurosceptics are embraced, even promoted, could be used to show that the government can move forward as a team. A senior minister said there will be an ""overarching need to bring the party together to govern"". There are many moving parts to all of this. It's not even clear yet which ministers will declare for the Eurosceptic cause, although you'd get a decent bet on Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, Theresa Villiers, John Whittingdale, Michael Gove and still possibly Sajid Javid. And then there's even Mayor of London Boris Johnson. And of course it is not at all certain that the pro EU side of the argument will win the referendum. If David Cameron loses, all bets are off, and his job might even be on the line. But if he wins, and this reshuffle comes to pass, who might go where? Well, there would likely be a senior job for Boris Johnson, maybe as home secretary or even defence secretary with a move in turn, for Theresa May, perhaps to the Foreign Office. Mr Johnson turned down a Cabinet job after the general election, but the prime minister has promised there will be another offer. Michael Fallon, the current defence secretary, could replace Chris Grayling as leader of the House of Commons. It's likely too that there would be another senior woman promoted into the Cabinet, perhaps Anna Soubry or Priti Patel. None of this, of course, is certain. Politics is in a strangely febrile place, and it would be foolhardy to predict much about the next few months with much conviction. Downing Street sources say it's nonsense to suggest they are putting time and energy into planning a reshuffle. The focus is all on the renegotiation, then winning the referendum. Yet as ministers make their minds up which side to take in the campaign, don't doubt that their futures after the public vote are just as much of a preoccupation as the principles of stay or go. "
2016-02-14,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands. Randolph was heard to say: ""I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."""

2016-02-14,Spy bill analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20160215005149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35553408,"Everyone agrees a new law governing surveillance powers is required but the devil is in the detail, as a series of parliamentary reports have illustrated. The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.The Joint Parliamentary Committee makes 86 recommendations overall but the central thrust is that while the direction of the draft bill is broadly correct, the government still needs to make significant changes, particularly in making a number of provisions clearer.The bill aims to takes powers which were previously exercised using often obscure legal provisions and put them onto a clearer footing. But one of the most controversial provisions is a new power - to compel companies to keep Internet Connection Records (ICRs) for 12 months which detail the sites everyone visits on the web (although not what exact page). Not enough has been done to explain what is involved, the committee says. Law enforcement rather than spies are the chief sponsors of this provision and the committee gives them support for the overall concept (even adding that they could be expanded to identify people visiting websites which hold illegal material rather than just for identifying forms of communication). However, it says that more needs to be done on the detail. In particular there are problems over defining ICRs, over the technical feasibility of their collection and storage as well as the costs involved. All of this may make it challenging to deliver them in the timescale envisaged. Bulk Personal Datasets are another area of concern. Clear justifications and operational cases for why the powers are required remain lacking, the committee says, also criticising government for being unwilling to provide much detail of what kinds of datasets would be involved.Some might be obvious such as passport records but others - like health records - would be far more sensitive. It is notable in the report that the committee tried to get an answer on whether records such as health data would be excluded but was not given one by government.There is relatively little detail on the issue of encryption which has been of concern to many companies (notably Apple which submitted detailed evidence).A report from the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns from industry about the potential impact of ambiguity in some provisions. The indications are that the government wants to retain its right to seek unencrypted data even if it knows it may not always be possible to obtain it.  There are still some concerns from industry over what is meant when its said that companies need to take ""practicable"" steps to provide such data and what impact it has on end-to-end encryption systems. Some companies also remain concerned they could be compelled to hack into their own products under equipment interference provisions.The Joint Committee also calls for some significant changes to the way in which judges provide oversight over powers to increase independence. On intelligence sharing, the Joint Committee also notably calls for it to be made illegal to get another country to spy on behalf of a UK agency or body when it does not have the authorisation to collect such information. The legislation is often technical by necessity and so a lot of weight is placed on ""codes of practice"" which outline how exactly the powers should be used. The committee say these should be published along with the bill to provide greater transparency and clarity.The Intelligence and Security Committee report earlier in the week focused more narrowly on intelligence agency powers but took a tougher line. It criticised the lack of an over-arching privacy protection and also said that when challenged about what the power of bulk equipment interference actually involved, officials were unable to provide an answer. The committee have rejected the idea of a sunset clause in which the powers would expire after five years instead calling for a joint committee to review the use of the powers as the five year point approached.There were clearly differences of opinion within the committee and despite the huge amount of evidence it took, some still feel it may have had to rush. One member, Lord Strasburger argued the government had not learnt the lesson of drafting a bill too broadly and said that essential information was missing that parliament needed in order to decide if the powers were necessary and proportionate. The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year."

Mr Tusk is on a tour of European countries ahead of the two-day summit of EU leaders, which begins on Thursday.Speaking after holding talks with the Romanian and French presidents, he said negotiations on Britain's future inside the 28-member bloc were ""difficult but… hugely important"".Reflecting on the talks, he said: ""This is a critical moment. It is high time we started listening to each other's arguments more than to our own.""It is natural in negotiations that positions harden, as we get closer to crunch time.""But the risk of break-up is real because this process is indeed very fragile. Handle with care. What is broken cannot be mended.""BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Tusk was trying to ""concentrate minds"" ahead of the EU summit as leaders of the different member states stake out their positions.The French government is said to be concerned about UK calls for protection for non-eurozone countries, but No 10 said the French had shown ""willingness"" to find a solution.As part of his diplomatic push, Mr Cameron - who met German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks on Friday - will discuss the renegotiation with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Tuesday, as well as senior MEPs.If a deal is agreed on the PM's reforms, which also include curbs on migrants' welfare entitlement, he will hold a cabinet meeting on Friday evening, sources have told the BBC.Downing Street has said ministers cannot speak out until the cabinet has met to agree a government position, and it was claimed this would give the Remain campaign an unfair head start if a meeting was delayed until the following week."
2016-02-15,Met chief to meet Lord Brittan's widow,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35584041,"The Metropolitan Police commissioner is due to meet the widow of Lord Brittan later to discuss the investigation of a rape claim against the late peer. Police interviewed Lord Brittan about the claim in 2014 but he died last year unaware the inquiry had been dropped.In the private meeting, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is expected to be questioned about the length of time Scotland Yard took to conclude its investigation.Lord Brittan had denied the historical allegation against him.The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967, but the case was reopened less than a year later.Police interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought. Lord Brittan passed away in January 2015.In a letter last year, a senior officer apologised to Lady Brittan saying she should have been told earlier that had he been alive, Lord Brittan would not have been prosecuted. Investigating officers had told the complainant this in April 2015, a Met report into the handling of the case revealed, but Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time.Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.A Met spokesman also said that notifying the complainant in April had been ""premature"", because the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June 2015.Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but a review - carried out by Dorset Police and published earlier this month - found its investigation of the claim was ""fully justified"".The former home secretary has also been the subject of a separate investigation as part of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard's inquiry into allegations of a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says it is understood Sir Bernard will also be asked about this investigation in the meeting.Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January 2015 aged 75."

The flats, for the elderly or people with learning disabilities, are more expensive to build and run because they provide additional support.  Ministers say they are reviewing the sheltered housing sector ""to ensure it works in the best way possible"".The National Housing Federation (NHF) has calculated that nearly 2,500 units have so far been scrapped or delayed as sheltered housing providers face losing an average of £68 a week per tenant.  David Orr, chief executive of the NHF, told the BBC: ""There is real impact now.""New homes for people with support needs - vulnerable people - that would be being built have been cancelled."" BBC News has spoken to four housing associations who confirmed their plans had needed to change:The changes - announced in Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement - will bring housing benefit rates for social housing in line with the sums paid to landlords in the private sector.  Mr Osborne said the move would deliver savings of £225m by 2020-21.The cap includes sheltered housing, which is more expensive to provide due to the additional support on offer - anything from canteens to round-the-clock care staff.The benefit will not actually be cut until April 2018 but it will affect people signing new tenancies from this April.  At one sheltered housing complex in Harrogate, the need for new development is clear - there is only one lift and the corridors are narrow.  ""We need to move,"" said resident Frank Forkes. ""It's very cramped. If the lift breaks down, it's chaos because you've people upstairs in wheelchairs.""  The housing association has spent eight years developing plans for a new complex a couple of miles away. But following the government's announcement in November, the board of Harrogate Neighbours delayed the scheme. Under the new rules, they will lose £100,000 per annum on it.  ""As an organisation we have to be absolutely certain that we can afford to deliver all the services. And at the moment, it's not viable,"" chief executive Sue Cawthray said.  The consequences of the benefit cuts are even worse for Contour Homes in Manchester. ""We stand to lose - over the course of the 40-year life cycle of the development - if things stay as they are, £3.35m. As an organisation, we couldn't just absorb that,"" director of customer services Chris Langan said.  Labour has described the housing benefit cut as a ""catastrophe for those who can least afford it"".But a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We've always been clear that we value the work the supported accommodation sector does to protect the most vulnerable members of society. ""That's why we are carrying out a thorough review, working with the sector, to ensure that it works in the best way possible - which is what the NHF has asked for.""We are also providing councils with £870m of Discretionary Housing Payments which can be paid to people in supported accommodation.""

2016-02-15,Nation must focus on mental health - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35565216,"David Cameron has called for the nation to focus on mental health after a review revealed inadequate, underfunded care, leading to ""thousands of tragic and unnecessary deaths"".The report - by a taskforce set up by NHS England - said around three-quarters of people with mental health problems received no help at all.Ministers agreed more needs to be done, committing £1bn extra a year by 2020. The government says this will help treat a million more people a year.The funds are to come out of the £8.4bn the government has promised to the health service during this Parliament and comes on top of extra money already announced for children's services.Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""We should be frank. We have not done enough to end the stigma of mental health. ""We have focused a lot on physical health and we haven't as a country focused enough on mental health.""1 in 4people experience problems each year75%receive no help£105bn cost to economy £9.2bn  spent by NHS a year 15-20 years  shorter life expectancy for those with severe problems Mental health care is sometimes called the Cinderella service of the NHS. Over the years it has been neglected, marginalised and under-funded. The taskforce's report acknowledges this.So will the recommendations have the necessary impact? Ministers and NHS bosses have all said they're fully committed to it.But similar things were said in 2011 when the coalition launched its mental health strategy. And, as the BBC reported on Sunday, that didn't stop investment being cut. With money so tight in the NHS, the nagging fear is that despite the promises being made history could still repeat itself.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterCurrently £9.2bn a year is spent on the condition - less than a tenth of the NHS budget - despite one in four people experiencing a mental health problem each year.The result is that an estimated three-quarters of people go without any help, with the taskforce's report acknowledging that services were so bad that lives have been ""put on hold or ruined"" and ""thousands of tragic and unnecessary deaths"" have been caused. The review also said more attention needs to be paid to rising suicide rates. NHS England believes the strategy will help to ensure that another one million people receive support - whereas at the moment fewer than two million people do so.It said the investment promised will help pay for:It said that together these measures would help reduce the demand on specialist inpatient wards in hospitals and therefore help tackle the much-criticised practice of sending people long distances for treatment.Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, who led the taskforce, said the strategy should act as a ""landmark moment"" for mental health care, which was currently ""very patchy"".""We are saying to the NHS, to government, to industry, to local leaders and to the public that mental health must be a priority for everyone,"" he said.While the extra funding was crucial, he added that some stigma around mental illness ""still prevails, right the way inside the health service, as it does in society"", and this needed to change.NHS England boss Simon Stevens said he was ""fully committed"" to implementing the recommendations. But Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Sir Simon Wessely warned it would take ""sustained work"" to end the ""decades of inequality"".And Prof Sheila Hollins, of the British Medical Association, pointed out such promises had been made before.""Those suffering from mental illness need to see these pledges fulfilled.""Meanwhile the Welsh government said spending on mental health had been ring-fenced since 2008, with investment topping £600m this year. The current annual allocation to mental health in Northern Ireland is £247m.  The Scottish government said it had made a commitment to invest an additional £150 million over a five year period in improving access to mental health services.Explained: What is mental health and where can I go for help?Mood assessment: Could I be depressed?In The Mind: BBC News special report (or follow ""Mental health"" tag in the BBC News app)"
2016-02-15,Councils warned over political boycotts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35580758,"Councils are being warned of ""severe penalties"" if they impose political boycotts on products from overseas.New government guidance suggests boycotts could breach an existing World Trade Organization agreement and weaken community relationships.Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock will make a speech later, warning that such ""divisive"" action can also undermine national security.Labour said the Conservatives were attacking local democracy.But a government source said foreign policy was a matter for national government, not local councils.The guidance will specify that locally imposed boycotts by public bodies - including councils - are ""inappropriate"" unless formal legal sanctions or embargoes have been put in place by the government.It will warn such action risks breaching a World Trade Organization agreement signed by both the EU and Israel, which requires equal treatment for suppliers from all signatory nations.The Cabinet Office said town hall boycotts could also ""undermine good community relations, poisoning and polarising debate, weakening integration and fuelling anti-Semitism"", as well as hindering Britain's export trade and harming international relationships.Mr Hancock is making the announcement in Israel, which has often been the subject of boycotts in the past.He is expected to say the guidelines, and new rules on investing pensions funds, will ""help prevent damaging and counter-productive local foreign policies undermining our national security"".A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa. He said: ""People have the right to elect local representatives able to make decisions free of central government political control. That includes withdrawal of investments or procurement on ethical and human rights grounds."""
2016-02-15,HSBC to keep headquarters in London,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35575793,"UK banking giant HSBC has announced it is to keep its headquarters in London.Concerns about stricter UK regulations led Europe's biggest bank to launch a review into whether to move elsewhere, with Hong Kong seen as the most likely alternative.But the bank said it had decided unanimously against the move and that London ""offered the best outcome for our customers and shareholders"".The decision was seen as a vote of confidence for the UK.The bank has had its headquarters in the UK since 1993 but makes most of its money overseas, and Asia accounts for the majority of its profit.Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, told the Today programme: ""London offered the best of both worlds for us. HSBC at its heart is a bank focused on trade and investment flows.""The UK is one of the most globally connected economies in the world with a fantastic regulatory system and legal system and immense experience in dealing with international affairs,"" Mr Flint said.""The government's made very clear its commitment to ensuring that that UK remains a leading international financial centre ... We've ended up with the best of both worlds - a pivot to Asia led from London.""HSBC is understood to have paid about £30m to advisors to help it reach the decision to remain based in London.HSBC shares rose 1.36% in Monday's trading in London to 446.4p, but have fallen 17% this year. The bank's Kong Hong-listed shares closed 4% higher on Monday. However, analysts at Investec said HSBC's decision was ""regrettable"" because it faced tighter regulations and the cost of the UK bank levy. ""We see HSBC's announcement as a missed opportunity,"" said Investec analyst Ian Gordon.HSBC had been paying £1bn a year through the UK banking levy before the government changed the tax last year. Mr Flint said ""it was important that there was a change in the scope of the levy"".""A levy based on an international balance sheet was a disincentive for a global group, and we made that point ever since the start of the levy. It was good to see that the scope of the levy changed to being a domestic impost, and that was important,"" the HSBC chairman said.However, Mr Flint denied that HSBC had forced the government's hand in changing the banking levy.""We had no negotiation with the government. The government was well aware of our view, and indeed the view of many other people who commented upon it, but there certainly was no pressure put, or negotiation.""He added that the regulatory regime had ""not been softened"".HSBC's decision was based on ""a generational view"" and not on ""short-term dynamics"", Mr Flint said.""It [the decision to stay] was based on a very thoughtful perspective on how economics will play out over the next 20 [to] 25 years,"" he said.HSBC said that London had an ""internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system"" and added that it also was ""home to a large pool of highly skilled, international talent"".It was therefore ""ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC"".Part of the review was considering whether the increased regulation of the banking industry in the UK - in particular the increased tax burden - warranted moving elsewhere.But in the last Budget, the Chancellor George Osborne introduced a gradual reduction in the bank levy on balance sheets - a move which particularly affected HSBC, because of its large balance sheet.In 2014 it paid £750m of the £1.9bn raised by the government through that particular tax.For HSBC itself, the decision wasn't just about the tax environment in the UK.There was also the problem of the regulatory environment in China - with the central bank causing nervousness among investors and volatility in the markets after intervening in the stock and currency markets.Poorer news about the Chinese economy also focused minds at HSBC's Canary Wharf headquarters in London's docklands.One interesting point to make about the decision is that whatever fears HSBC has about Britain possibly leaving the European Union, London's attraction as a financial capital was more significant.Which raises a challenge for those who argue that businesses could quit the UK if Britain were to leave the EU.Read Kamal in fullThe board added that it had also decided to end the practice of reviewing the location of the group's headquarters every three years, and would only revisit the matter if there was ""a material change in circumstances"".It stressed that Asia remained ""at the heart of the group's strategy"" and that it was putting ""particular emphasis on investing further in the Pearl River Delta and ASEAN region"".Hong Kong's Monetary Authority (HKMA) said it respected HSBC's decision.""The HKMA appreciates that for a large international bank such as HSBC, relocation of domicile is a very major and complicated undertaking,"" said Norman Chan, its chief executive.The Treasury welcomed the move.""It's a vote of confidence in the government's economic plan, and a boost to our goal of making the UK a great place to do more business with China and the rest of Asia,"" a spokesperson said.The CBI business lobby group also said the announcement was ""good news"" because strong banks were ""critical for the British economy"".That sentiment was echoed by the BBA, the banking industry body and TheCityUK.In line with other banks, HSBC shares have fallen sharply this year. The stock is down 18% since the start of the year and more than 30% from last April, when the review into where to base its HQ was first announced.The bank will report full-year results on Monday, 22 February. It is in the process of implementing a $5bn (£3.4bn) savings drive and cutting 8,000 jobs in the UK."

""There are still a lot of moving parts,"" Mr Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""We've got a negotiation that will run through this week and, I have no doubt, will run right to the wire.""Mr Hammond said the draft deal contains lots of ""square brackets"", ""blanks"" and ""unclear language"", but added a final agreement should provide ""clear winds for Britain on national sovereignty"".Mr Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU by the end of 2017 but could bring the date forward if a deal is reached this week.

He held the seat for eight years, moving to the Lords in 1971 when he inherited the title of Baron Avebury. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron paid tribute to a ""true Liberal"", ""great campaigner"" and ""committed internationalist"". Lord Avebury: ObituaryMr Farron  said the peer, who had been suffering from leukaemia, would ""be remembered as much for his unyielding commitment to fighting for Liberal causes as his sensational by-election victory"".""He campaigned to lower the voting age, founded the parliamentary human rights group and fought for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, taking up the cases of hundreds of individuals fleeing persecution.""He was a committed internationalist, regularly promoting human rights around the world. The Liberal Democrats have lost a great campaigner, a great friend and a true champion of the Liberal cause."" A Buddhist, Lord Avebury was the patron of Angulimala, which promotes the teaching and practice of Buddhism in British prisons. He also campaigned on behalf of secular causes, fighting to remove mandatory daily worship in maintained schools.In 2009, the National Secular Society named the peer secularist of the year, jointly with Evan Harris, for his work on abolition of blasphemy laws in England and Wales.His biography on the Lib Dem website says he also ""sought and won"" a battle with the senior parliamentary official known as Black Rod to keep the right to park bicycles against the front of the Houses of Parliament.Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, said Lord Avebury had supported countless human rights campaigns. ""His knowledge of foreign affairs, particularly of remote parts of the developing world, was second to none. The weak and oppressed in these places have lost a true champion.""I have lost a very close friend. The nation has lost a human rights champion."""

2016-02-15,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman.

He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-15,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-15,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-15,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-15,What do red and yellow cards mean?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471248,"Football fans are all too familiar with yellow and red cards. But in the EU it's a bit more complicated.An important element of UK Prime Minister David Cameron's EU proposals is the right of national parliaments to block EU laws. It would mean showing a ""red card"" to the European Commission - going beyond the current yellow-card mechanism.The red card does not yet exist - but it might, if EU leaders accept the proposed changes described by European Council President Donald Tusk. What does the yellow card do?It was introduced in the EU's 2009 Lisbon Treaty, to address concerns about ""subsidiarity"" - the principle the EU should not legislate on matters best dealt with at local, regional or national level.The European Commission has sole responsibility for initiating EU laws. Critics accuse it of over-regulating, tying up governments and businesses in too much red tape.The yellow-card system system gives each national parliament two votes - making a total of 56. (There are 28 member states.)To trigger the yellow card, a minimum of 18 votes is needed. The parliaments also have to send the commission ""reasoned opinions"" spelling out why they object to a draft law. The deadline for doing so is eight weeks.Once triggered, the commission may decide to keep, amend or withdraw the draft text - and must explain its decision. But the yellow card is no automatic block on a proposal. Is it used much?The yellow card has been used twice.In May 2012, the commission withdrew a draft law, Monti II, that would have introduced a new EU mechanism for settling labour disputes, after 12 parliaments objected.According to Ian Cooper, a political analyst at Cambridge University, the Danish parliament led that yellow-card initiative. National MPs had co-ordinated their arguments face-to-face, helped by their representatives in Brussels, he said in a blog.In October 2013, the UK was among 11 parliaments that objected to a commission proposal to create an EU public prosecutor's office. On that occasion, the commission decided to maintain the proposal, despite the yellow card.An orange-card procedure also exists, but has not been used yet. If a majority of national parliaments jointly oppose a draft law, the commission has to review it. The failure to use the orange card shows that national MPs are focused on national interests, and ""struggle to find a common stance on European issues"", Agata Gostynska of the Centre for European Reform told the BBC.What could change with a red card?Mr Cameron says a red-card mechanism would enhance the sovereignty of national parliaments, enabling them, jointly, to ""stop unwanted legislative proposals"".The red card would force the commission to amend or drop the draft law to accommodate national concerns. But the document from Mr Tusk says the blocking mechanism would apply only in areas where legislation might better be done at national level, under the subsidiarity principle, and not to EU proposals more generally.And some of Mr Tusk's language may be viewed by critics as vague and open to interpretation, the BBC's Simon Wilson reports. Principles will be ""duly taken into account"" and ""appropriate arrangements"" will be made, his proposal says. Instead of eight weeks, national parliaments would have 12 weeks to make up their minds about a draft law from the commission.But the threshold for triggering the red card would be 55% of the total votes allocated to the parliaments.If that is achieved, Mr Tusk suggests, the complaint will be put on the agenda of the next council meeting, where EU governments are represented, for a ""comprehensive discussion"". The red card ""could ensure that EU institutions listen more to national parliaments' concerns"", Agata Gostynska said.But using the card system also requires MPs to spend more time examining European issues, she said. ""They usually prefer to look at domestic issues, which affect voters directly,"" she added."
2016-02-15,Bowing to the inevitable,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35581401,"This afternoon Number 10 has bowed to the inevitable, and conceded that if (and it is still an if) the deal is done at the EU summit in Brussels this week David Cameron will hold a cabinet meeting as soon as he returns to London early on Friday evening.A few weeks ago we reported very real concerns about the choreography in the aftermath of the summit from Eurosceptic cabinet ministers, worried that the PM would be setting the pace and terms of the debate in its vital early hours. While they didn't commit officially to a position, the sense in Downing Street was that there was no need to shift cabinet from its usual Tuesday spot.They hoped and expected that cabinet ministers who wanted to campaign for exit would keep their counsel until then, when the government had adopted its official position. But in truth, at least one senior figure had already resolved to break their silence and reveal their plan to campaign for Out over the weekend, in defiance of Number 10.With that knowledge, and several frank conversations with Eurosceptic ministers, David Cameron's team have decided to relent. This is not just a story for political process nerds (honest), but it illustrates how Eurosceptics, although in a clear minority in the cabinet, have been able to force Downing Street's hand.This week's summit and now, the 24 hours that follow, are shaping up to be some of the most important in David Cameron's political career.

2016-02-15,Risk of a ‘non’,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35580517,"Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris shortly - the latest leg in his drive to negotiate new EU membership terms for the UK.After the draft deal was published two weeks ago, an irate editorial in the French newspaper Le Monde fumed that the concessions made to Britain were ""exorbitant"". And while some in Mr Cameron's own Conservative Party dismiss his renegotiation as a watery fudge, politicians in Paris have a very different view. Of particular concern here is the question of future financial regulation. UK ministers, too, think this is the most important part of the whole renegotiation. The issue is this: The majority of EU countries that have the euro are integrating further and building a banking union with common rules and regulations. That process will deepen in the coming years. Mr Cameron wants legal guarantees that the eurozone will not rig the rules in a way that could harm the interests of countries that do not have the euro. But France frets that the UK is seeking special treatment for the City of London, that could harm the single market in financial services. France is also concerned a new mechanism that would allow non-euro countries to escalate their concerns could clog up decision-making. The UK insists it is not asking for any veto or competitive advantage, but this is likely to be the focus of the hastily arranged talks here this evening. President Hollande also faces an election next year - and while he wants the UK to stay in the EU, he will not do a deal that gives his opponents a chance to claim he sold out to Britain.

2016-02-15,Victory for vellum,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35569281,"After a reprieve, the UK is to continue printing and storing its laws on vellum, a paper made from calf or goat-skin. But shouldn't these traditions give way to digital storage, asks Chris Stokel-Walker. Last week the House of Lords decided to end the printing of laws on vellum for cost reasons. But now the Cabinet Office is to provide the money from its own budget for the thousand-year-old tradition to continue.Vellum lasts a long time. Dig into the archives of the UK's parliament and pull out the oldest extant law and you'll find a very old document. It was first inscribed in 1497. Over time, ordinary paper can deteriorate rapidly, while vellum is said to retain its integrity for much longer. Original copies of the Magna Carta, signed more than 800 years ago on vellum, still exist.The proposed change was a move to higher-quality archival paper. But are politicians missing the point?Sharon McMeekin, of the Digital Preservation Coalition, an advocacy and advice group for digital recordkeeping, thinks so.""People have been bemoaning the loss of history by changing to archival paper,"" she explains. ""I think people are missing the point there. Truly representing the context and history in which these records were made require them to be kept in a digital format. It's more representative of the technologies and communication methods used today.""So why in the digital age do we keep physical records of documents at all?There's a simple answer, says Adrian Brown, the director of parliamentary archives, who oversees a collection including 8km-worth of physical records of parchment, paper and photographs in the 325ft tall Victoria Tower at the western edge of the Palace of Westminster. In the tower, scrolls of vellum are piled up in a vast repository, spooled in a range of different sizes, looking superficially much as they would have done hundreds of years ago.""We simply respond to the way parliament chooses to create its records,"" Brown says. ""In this case those are still going to be physical - though the proportion that is digital will increase over time.""But there are other reasons, too.""In many circles there's still a real discomfort around digital archiving, and a lack of belief that digital can survive into the future,"" explains Jenny Mitcham, digital archivist at the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York.The whole concept of digital storage is a relatively new innovation, and the path by which it could survive through the years is not clear. ""We don't have the ability to look back and say we know for a fact in 200 years time we'll still have this stuff,"" reasons Mitcham. ""We can't prove that fact without a time machine.""Vellum is made from calf-skin. The word shares its derivation with the word ""veal"" from the old French ""velin"" (Collins Dictionary) or ""veelin"" (Petit Robert).  Vellum is made by first soaking calf-skin in a lime wash, says calligrapher and illuminator Patricia Lovett. The lime causes the hair follicles to expand, making it easier to scrape fat and fur from the skin. This is done with a curved-bladed knife called a ""scudder"". The prepared skin is then washed and stretched onto a wooden frame, and scraped further with a lunar knife to raise the nap and create a more even thickness. Finally the skin is left to dry; the length of time depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and the individual qualities of the skin.   Patricia Lovett, calligrapherWatch vellum being made on BBC 4's Illuminations: The Private Lives of Medieval KingsThere's an excellent example of how a digital archive can quickly run into problems.Between 1984-86 the BBC Domesday Project engaged more than a million people from around Britain. Children at more than 9,000 schools helped compile a statistical survey, personal thoughts and memories. The data was stored on special laserdiscs, then seen as a technology of the future.Nearly two decades later, there were virtually no extant disc players able to read the specially formatted discs. After a lot of work, the data was made readable, but the case for digital archiving had suffered a setback. ""Examples like that imply that digital is more fragile than physical,"" Mitcham laments.Mike Tibbetts, one of the two creators of the Domesday Project, wrote in 2008 that ""the fault in all this lies not in the lack of vision or foresight by the technologists but that, at least in the UK, the national systems of data preservation and heritage archiving simply don't work reliably or consistently.""This is the issue, according to Jenny Mitcham. Just as preserving a physical archive requires careful consideration of temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure to prevent paper from turning brittle and breaking, so digital archives need to be tended to.""There's certainly truth in the fact that if [a] digital [format] is neglected, it'll become obsolete,"" she says. ""But if it's brought into a digital archive, and that digital archive is well set up and knows what it's doing, migrating and actively managing files over time, the chances those files will be readable in the future are vastly improved.""Adrian Brown lists the difficulties in maintaining paper records - ""decay, chemical changes that happen in the physical items; you've got insects and animal damage; the effects of temperature and light and humidity and dust. Tearing, rubbing, those kinds of issues.""But with digital, there are different risks. ""One of the things about digital information is that it's not fundamentally human-readable,"" he explains. ""You need some kind of technology to turn it into something understandable. Technology as we know changes very rapidly; what you can find is your way of turning those 1s and 0s into meaningful information can be threatened if you don't take precautions.""And, as anyone who has lost beloved holiday snaps to a hard drive failure knows, IT systems are far from infallible.""With digital, the last thing you want to do is put it somewhere and leave it alone,"" Mitcham says.

2016-02-15,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216021731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands. Randolph was heard to say: ""I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."""

2016-02-16,No 10 claims MEPs' backing for EU deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35584189,"The leaders of the three largest groups in the European Parliament have ""made clear their support"" for the UK's EU deal, Downing Street has said. They also told David Cameron they would take ""necessary legislation"" through parliament ""swiftly"", said No 10.A final deal on UK renegotiation may come when EU leaders meet on Thursday.But some parts may still need European Parliament approval. Its president pledged to be constructive even though he could not guarantee MEPs' backing.Mr Cameron also met European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss the reforms the UK is seeking to its relationship with the EU, as he continues his diplomatic push ""where there are still details to be nailed down"". Before meeting Mr Cameron, Mr Juncker said there was no ""plan B"" as he refused to contemplate Britain leaving the 28-member bloc.""I am not entering into the details of a plan B, because we don't have a plan B, we have a plan A. Britain will stay in the European Union as a constructive and active member of the Union,"" he said.European Council president Donald Tusk, who is overseeing the UK's renegotiation - which is taking place before the British people vote in a referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union - has said talks on the draft deal were ""fragile"".On Monday, he warned that the negotiations over the UK's demands were at a ""critical moment"" and ""the risk of break-up is real"".In a separate development on Tuesday the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, spoke at a Foreign Office awards ceremony of how ""in an increasingly turbulent world, our ability to unite in common action with other nations is essential"".This was interpreted by some as signalling the Duke's support for staying in the EU, with Britain Stronger in Europe saying ""people from all walks of life are getting behind the campaign"". However the rival Leave.EU campaign said they ""could just as easily claim"" his words showed ""we should not give any importance to the EU"".A spokesman for the prince later denied it was an intervention in the EU debate, saying it was a speech to young diplomats and the word ""Europe"" was not mentioned once.European Parliament president Mr Schulz, who described his meeting with Mr Cameron on Tuesday as ""very constructive"", said that once a deal was agreed by EU leaders, MEPs would start the legislative process as soon as possible.But he cautioned: ""To be quite clear: no government can go to a parliament and say, 'this is our proposal, can you give a guarantee about the result?' This is, in democracy, not possible.""Therefore my answer is the European Parliament will do the utmost to support compromise and a fair deal, but I can't pre-empt the result in the European Parliament.""He said in his experience ""it does go in a good direction"" when there has been such an agreement between all the heads of state.Mr Schulz also insisted that everything must be done within the framework of EU treaties, saying no treaty changes are possible ""for the time being"".Critics argue that the European Parliament could change the terms of the deal after the UK referendum if Britain voted to remain in the EU.Leave.EU - one of the groups campaigning for an EU exit - said Mr Schulz's comments showed the PM's draft deal ""is not binding without a new treaty that the European Court in Strasbourg has to adhere to"".Mr Cameron's planned curbs to child benefit for EU migrants appear to be a sticking point in the talks with the EU, with unease from eastern European countries.European Commission President Mr Juncker said he expected the proposed benefit changes to be at the heart of debate this week.Czech Europe minister Tomas Prouza told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he expected the proposals would only apply to new applicants, and not affect the existing 34,000 migrants in the UK who receive it.Downing Street has so far refused to say whether the changes extend to existing claimants or not.The move is likely to prompt further accusations that the PM is having to water down his demands, having originally proposed halting the payment of child benefit altogether. Instead, the benefit payments would be linked to the cost of living in the country where the child lives, under the terms of the draft deal.If a deal is agreed on the PM's reforms, he will hold a cabinet meeting on Friday evening, sources have told the BBC.Downing Street has said ministers cannot speak out until the cabinet has met to agree a government position, and it had been claimed this would give the Remain campaign an unfair head start if a meeting was delayed until the following week.Mr Cameron is seeking key changes on European integration, business competiveness, benefits restrictions and the operation of the eurozone.The prime minister has promised an in-out referendum on whether the UK should remain within the EU by the end of 2017.Are you in the UK or any other EU member state?

2016-02-16,UK inflation rises to 0.3% in January,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35586431,"UK inflation edged up to a 12 month high in January, as a fall in petrol prices eased.Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rose by 0.3%. It was helped by smaller falls in food and fuel prices than a year ago.Annual inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2% target for two years, and last year it was zero.The BoE said earlier this month that it expected inflation to stay below 1% this year.North Sea oil prices dropped to a 12 year low of $27.10 last month and have almost halved over the past 12 months.But the Office for National Statistics measure of fuels and lubricants costs was only 7.3% lower than in January 2015, the smallest drop since November 2014.Continuing low inflation makes the chance of an interest rate rise in the near future unlikely.Few economists expect the BoE to raise rates before late this year at the earliest, and some analysts see a risk that the BoE could instead have cut to rates below the record low of 0.5% where they have been for almost seven years.Financial markets do not currently expect interest rates to rise until the end of the decade due to concerns including a global economic slowdown and continuing low oil prices.Food prices fell by 0.6% between December and January as opposed to a 1% fall a year earlier.Supermarkets have been engaged in a long-running price war, and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl continue to take market share from the ""big four"" supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisions.But the ONS said alcohol prices rose 5.2% between December and January, with spirits increasing by 7.5%, beer climbing by 3.6%, and wine up 4.8%."
2016-02-16,EDF extends life of UK nuclear plants,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35583740,"French energy firm EDF will extend the life of four of its eight nuclear power plants in the UK.The move will safeguard 2,000 jobs and help with tight energy supplies.Heysham 1 and Hartlepool will have their life extended by five years until 2024, while Heysham 2 and Torness will see their closure dates pushed back by seven years to 2030.Meanwhile, EDF said its 2015 profits fell 68% to €1.18bn mainly due to writedowns on coal-fired plants.The results were below analysts' expectations.The value of plants in the UK, Italy, Poland and Belgium fell, and the company also took charges on its Edison oil and gas exploration business.EDF will cut its dividend by 15 cents to €1.10 a share with an option for payment in new shares rather than cash.Its shares have fallen almost 25% since the start of the year.EDF said its decision to extend the life of its plants followed ""extensive technical and safety reviews"".Chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said: ""Our continuing investment, our expertise and the professional relationship we have with the safety regulator means we can safely prolong the operating life of our nuclear power stations.   ""Their excellent output shows that reliability is improving whilst their safety and environmental performance is higher than ever.""The four nuclear plants employ about 2,000 permanent staff and 1,000 contractors.They provide electricity to about a quarter of the UK's homes.The announcement comes amid concern about the amount of energy available to keep the lights on, due to the closure of many of Britain's ageing power plants.Meanwhile, EDF has yet to finalise the investment for a new nuclear plant to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset.It has agreed a deal in principle under which China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) will pay a third of the cost of the £18bn project in exchange for a 33.5% stake.An EDF board meeting to approve the plan earlier this year is thought to have been postponed. Reports suggested the company was struggling to find the cash for its 66.5% stake.The company said on Tuesday: ""Hinkley Point C is a strong project which is fully ready for a final investment decision and successful construction. Final steps are well in hand to enable the full construction phase to be launched very soon.""However, Paul Dorfman of the UCL Energy Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Unfortunately, with the best will in the world, it may just not happen. Chris Bakken, the man charged by EDF to construct Hinkley Point, has quit to spend more time with his family, EDF shares have crashed to half their value a year ago; the budget for Hinkley alone is bigger than EDF's entire market value. ""Areva - EDF's construction arm - has been bankrupted by the huge costs and time overruns for the same brand of reactor they want to build at Hinkley, so it seems there's a good chance that it simply may not happen."""

2016-02-16,Sheltered housing 'hit by benefit cuts',https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35583415,"Hundreds of planned new sheltered accommodation units have been delayed or scrapped owing to proposed cuts to housing benefit, the BBC has learned.Several housing associations have said they are no longer financially viable. The flats, for the elderly or people with learning disabilities, are more expensive to build and run because they provide additional support.Ministers say they are reviewing the sheltered housing sector ""to ensure it works in the best way possible"".The National Housing Federation (NHF) has calculated that nearly 2,500 units have so far been scrapped or delayed as sheltered housing providers face losing an average of £68 a week per tenant.  David Orr, chief executive of the NHF, told the BBC: ""There is real impact now.""New homes for people with support needs - vulnerable people - that would be being built have been cancelled."" BBC News has spoken to four housing associations who confirmed their plans had needed to change:The changes - announced in Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement - will bring housing benefit rates for social housing in line with the sums paid to landlords in the private sector.Mr Osborne said the move, which will affect England, Scotland and Wales, would deliver savings of £225m by 2020-21, and is part of a £12bn package of cuts from the welfare bill.The cap includes sheltered housing, which is more expensive to provide due to the additional support on offer - anything from canteens to round-the-clock care staff.The benefit will not actually be cut until April 2018 but it will affect people signing new tenancies from this April. At one sheltered housing complex in Harrogate, the need for new development is clear - there is only one lift and the corridors are narrow.  ""We need to move,"" said resident Frank Forkes. ""It's very cramped. If the lift breaks down, it's chaos because you've people upstairs in wheelchairs.""  The housing association has spent eight years developing plans for a new complex a couple of miles away. But following the government's announcement in November, the board of Harrogate Neighbours delayed the scheme. Under the new rules, they will lose £100,000 per annum on it.  ""As an organisation we have to be absolutely certain that we can afford to deliver all the services. And at the moment, it's not viable,"" chief executive Sue Cawthray said.  The consequences of the benefit cuts are even worse for Contour Homes in Manchester. ""We stand to lose - over the course of the 40-year life cycle of the development - if things stay as they are, £3.35m. As an organisation, we couldn't just absorb that,"" director of customer services Chris Langan said.  Labour described the housing benefit cut as a ""catastrophe for those who can least afford it"".But a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We've always been clear that we value the work the supported accommodation sector does to protect the most vulnerable members of society. ""That's why we are carrying out a thorough review, working with the sector, to ensure that it works in the best way possible - which is what the NHF has asked for.""We are also providing councils with £870m of Discretionary Housing Payments which can be paid to people in supported accommodation.""

""So we've talked - she had quite a few questions - I thought it was important to meet her.""The former home secretary has also been the subject of a separate investigation as part of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard's inquiry into allegations of a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster. The Brittan family said in a statement: ""At the start of the meeting Sir Bernard offered Lady Brittan a full apology on behalf of the force, which she accepted.""Lady Brittan went on to ask and table some 30 questions regarding the two police inquiries as they related to Lord Brittan.""Sir Bernard promised to answer them in writing and Lady Brittan and the family await his response.""Lady Brittan and the family have nothing further to add at least until they have received Sir Bernard's written response.""Sir Bernard said he would respond within weeks, but added: ""We'll try and do it in days.""The Crown Prosecution Service advised the police in August 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967, but the case was reopened less than a year later. Police interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought. Lord Brittan died in January 2015. In a letter last year, a senior officer apologised to Lady Brittan, saying she should have been told earlier that, had he been alive, Lord Brittan would not have been prosecuted. Investigating officers had told the complainant this in April 2015, a Met report into the handling of the case revealed, but Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time.Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.A Met spokesman also said that notifying the complainant in April had been ""premature"", because the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June 2015.Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but a review - carried out by Dorset Police and published earlier this month - found its investigation of the claim was ""fully justified"".Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January 2015, aged 75."
2016-02-16,Porn site age check plans reviewed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35581860,"A public consultation over plans to implement age checks on pornography websites has been launched by the UK government.The proposals follow a Conservative Party manifesto commitment that ""all sites containing pornographic material"" must check that users are over 18.Internet providers, charities, academics and others will be asked to contribute to the consultation.A security expert said the plans would struggle to tackle porn on free sites.In the consultation document, the government proposes that the checks should apply to content that would receive - if formally classified - an 18 or R18 rating from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).""We are keen to hear from parents, schools, child protection experts, the pornography industry, internet service providers and online platforms that provide access to pornographic content,"" the consultation document explained.As part of the plans, the government intends to establish a new regulatory framework to enforce compliance with any rules that are made law.""Just as we do offline, we want to make sure children are prevented from accessing pornographic content online which should only be viewed by adults,"" said Baroness Shields, the Internet Safety and Security Minister.Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC said the issue was ""a matter of urgency"" and that children who had ready access to content rated over 18 could develop a ""warped"" view of sexual relationships.Prior to the general election, then Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said that the appointed regulator would have the power to force internet service providers to block sites that did not perform effective age checks.He also said providers who did not cooperate could be fined.The consultation document explains that the regulator of age checks on porn sites could be given powers to impose ""sanctions"" - including fines. Companies which support or provide services to the producers of pornographic content online could be ""directed"" to withdraw those services if sites were found to be persistently non-compliant.This could involve directing payment firms to cease processing transactions for porn producers.Ofcom's guidance on age checks for online video content suggest a range of options - from confirmation of credit card ownership to cross-checking a user's details with information on the electoral register.""Age checking is nothing new,"" said Ben Jordan from Aristotle, which provides such services.""The online gambling industry has been doing this for years and it's been very effective.""Dr Victoria Nash, at the Oxford Internet Institute, was the lead author of a report for the government on child use of online pornography.She said that gambling sites may well also check registered users' credentials against data in the electoral roll or driving licence databases.Dr Nash added that it was likely porn site age checks would use similar methods to ensure users are 18 or over.However, a leading security researcher has said this would not stamp out much of the pornography that is freely available online.""My initial response to this release is that while the UK government may get some traction with payment processors, and that that could have some effect, it won't affect the free pornography,"" said Dr Gilad Rosner, who is a member of the Cabinet Office Privacy and Consumer Advocacy Group.Dr Rosner added that much pornographic content was available on free sites and blogs which do not take any payments from users.""I would wager that we won't see much in the way of tangible results for the next five years,"" he said, ""This is a particularly challenging regulatory goal.""Even so, one of the most visited free sites for pornography has already signalled its intention to co-operate.""Pornhub will comply fully with any robust legislative and relevant local measures that emerge from this consultation,"" said a spokeswoman for the site.""As members of the Digital Policy Alliance, we have already been working to carve out a technical solution which works for all.""It's essential that all explicit adult content is covered, and non-compliant sites are quickly taken down."""

The government says this will help treat a million more people a year.The funds are to come out of the £8.4bn the government has promised to the health service during this Parliament and comes on top of extra money already announced for children's services.Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""We should be frank. We have not done enough to end the stigma of mental health. ""We have focused a lot on physical health and we haven't as a country focused enough on mental health.""1 in 4people experience problems each year75%receive no help£105bn cost to economy £9.2bn  spent by NHS a year 15-20 years  shorter life expectancy for those with severe problems Mental health care is sometimes called the Cinderella service of the NHS. Over the years it has been neglected, marginalised and under-funded. The taskforce's report acknowledges this.So will the recommendations have the necessary impact? Ministers and NHS bosses have all said they're fully committed to it.But similar things were said in 2011 when the coalition launched its mental health strategy. And, as the BBC reported on Sunday, that didn't stop investment being cut. With money so tight in the NHS, the nagging fear is that despite the promises being made history could still repeat itself.Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterCurrently £9.2bn a year is spent on the condition - less than a tenth of the NHS budget - despite one in four people experiencing a mental health problem each year.The result is that an estimated three-quarters of people go without any help, with the taskforce's report acknowledging that services were so bad that lives have been ""put on hold or ruined"" and ""thousands of tragic and unnecessary deaths"" have been caused. The review also said more attention needs to be paid to rising suicide rates. NHS England believes the strategy will help to ensure that another one million people receive support - whereas at the moment fewer than two million people do so.It said the investment promised will help pay for:It said that together these measures would help reduce the demand on specialist inpatient wards in hospitals and therefore help tackle the much-criticised practice of sending people long distances for treatment.Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, who led the taskforce, said the strategy should act as a ""landmark moment"" for mental health care, which was currently ""very patchy"".""We are saying to the NHS, to government, to industry, to local leaders and to the public that mental health must be a priority for everyone,"" he said.While the extra funding was crucial, he added that some stigma around mental illness ""still prevails, right the way inside the health service, as it does in society"", and this needed to change.NHS England boss Simon Stevens said he was ""fully committed"" to implementing the recommendations. But Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Sir Simon Wessely warned it would take ""sustained work"" to end the ""decades of inequality"".And Prof Sheila Hollins, of the British Medical Association, pointed out such promises had been made before.""Those suffering from mental illness need to see these pledges fulfilled.""Meanwhile the Welsh government said spending on mental health had been ring-fenced since 2008, with investment topping £600m this year. The current annual allocation to mental health in Northern Ireland is £247m.  The Scottish government said it had made a commitment to invest an additional £150 million over a five year period in improving access to mental health services.Explained: What is mental health and where can I go for help?Mood assessment: Could I be depressed?In The Mind: BBC News special report (or follow ""Mental health"" tag in the BBC News app)"
2016-02-16,Councils warned over political boycotts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35580758,"Councils are being warned of ""severe penalties"" if they impose political boycotts on products from overseas.New government guidance suggests boycotts could breach an existing World Trade Organization agreement and weaken community relationships.Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock will make a speech later, warning that such ""divisive"" action can also undermine national security.Labour said the Conservatives were attacking local democracy.But a government source said foreign policy was a matter for national government, not local councils.The guidance will specify that locally imposed boycotts by public bodies - including councils - are ""inappropriate"" unless formal legal sanctions or embargoes have been put in place by the government.It will warn such action risks breaching a World Trade Organization agreement signed by both the EU and Israel, which requires equal treatment for suppliers from all signatory nations.The Cabinet Office said town hall boycotts could also ""undermine good community relations, poisoning and polarising debate, weakening integration and fuelling anti-Semitism"", as well as hindering Britain's export trade and harming international relationships.Mr Hancock is making the announcement in Israel, which has often been the subject of boycotts in the past.He is expected to say the guidelines, and new rules on investing pensions funds, will ""help prevent damaging and counter-productive local foreign policies undermining our national security"".A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa. He said: ""People have the right to elect local representatives able to make decisions free of central government political control. That includes withdrawal of investments or procurement on ethical and human rights grounds."""
2016-02-16,HSBC to keep headquarters in London,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35575793,"UK banking giant HSBC has announced it is to keep its headquarters in London.Concerns about stricter UK regulations led Europe's biggest bank to launch a review into whether to move elsewhere, with Hong Kong seen as the most likely alternative.But the bank said it had decided unanimously against the move and that London ""offered the best outcome for our customers and shareholders"".The decision was seen as a vote of confidence for the UK.The bank has had its headquarters in the UK since 1993 but makes most of its money overseas, and Asia accounts for the majority of its profit.Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, told the Today programme: ""London offered the best of both worlds for us. HSBC at its heart is a bank focused on trade and investment flows.""The UK is one of the most globally connected economies in the world with a fantastic regulatory system and legal system and immense experience in dealing with international affairs,"" Mr Flint said.""The government's made very clear its commitment to ensuring that that UK remains a leading international financial centre ... We've ended up with the best of both worlds - a pivot to Asia led from London.""HSBC is understood to have paid about £30m to advisors to help it reach the decision to remain based in London.HSBC shares rose 1.36% in Monday's trading in London to 446.4p, but have fallen 17% this year. The bank's Kong Hong-listed shares closed 4% higher on Monday. However, analysts at Investec said HSBC's decision was ""regrettable"" because it faced tighter regulations and the cost of the UK bank levy. ""We see HSBC's announcement as a missed opportunity,"" said Investec analyst Ian Gordon.HSBC had been paying £1bn a year through the UK banking levy before the government changed the tax last year. Mr Flint said ""it was important that there was a change in the scope of the levy"".""A levy based on an international balance sheet was a disincentive for a global group, and we made that point ever since the start of the levy. It was good to see that the scope of the levy changed to being a domestic impost, and that was important,"" the HSBC chairman said.However, Mr Flint denied that HSBC had forced the government's hand in changing the banking levy.""We had no negotiation with the government. The government was well aware of our view, and indeed the view of many other people who commented upon it, but there certainly was no pressure put, or negotiation.""He added that the regulatory regime had ""not been softened"".HSBC's decision was based on ""a generational view"" and not on ""short-term dynamics"", Mr Flint said.""It [the decision to stay] was based on a very thoughtful perspective on how economics will play out over the next 20 [to] 25 years,"" he said.HSBC said that London had an ""internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system"" and added that it also was ""home to a large pool of highly skilled, international talent"".It was therefore ""ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC"".Part of the review was considering whether the increased regulation of the banking industry in the UK - in particular the increased tax burden - warranted moving elsewhere.But in the last Budget, the Chancellor George Osborne introduced a gradual reduction in the bank levy on balance sheets - a move which particularly affected HSBC, because of its large balance sheet.In 2014 it paid £750m of the £1.9bn raised by the government through that particular tax.For HSBC itself, the decision wasn't just about the tax environment in the UK.There was also the problem of the regulatory environment in China - with the central bank causing nervousness among investors and volatility in the markets after intervening in the stock and currency markets.Poorer news about the Chinese economy also focused minds at HSBC's Canary Wharf headquarters in London's docklands.One interesting point to make about the decision is that whatever fears HSBC has about Britain possibly leaving the European Union, London's attraction as a financial capital was more significant.Which raises a challenge for those who argue that businesses could quit the UK if Britain were to leave the EU.Read Kamal in fullThe board added that it had also decided to end the practice of reviewing the location of the group's headquarters every three years, and would only revisit the matter if there was ""a material change in circumstances"".It stressed that Asia remained ""at the heart of the group's strategy"" and that it was putting ""particular emphasis on investing further in the Pearl River Delta and ASEAN region"".Hong Kong's Monetary Authority (HKMA) said it respected HSBC's decision.""The HKMA appreciates that for a large international bank such as HSBC, relocation of domicile is a very major and complicated undertaking,"" said Norman Chan, its chief executive.The Treasury welcomed the move.""It's a vote of confidence in the government's economic plan, and a boost to our goal of making the UK a great place to do more business with China and the rest of Asia,"" a spokesperson said.The CBI business lobby group also said the announcement was ""good news"" because strong banks were ""critical for the British economy"".That sentiment was echoed by the BBA, the banking industry body and TheCityUK.In line with other banks, HSBC shares have fallen sharply this year. The stock is down 18% since the start of the year and more than 30% from last April, when the review into where to base its HQ was first announced.The bank will report full-year results on Monday, 22 February. It is in the process of implementing a $5bn (£3.4bn) savings drive and cutting 8,000 jobs in the UK."
2016-02-16,Centuries-old vellum tradition 'saved',https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35577458,"A centuries-old tradition of recording copies of Parliament's laws on calf skin will continue, a minister has said, after peers signalled its end.Matt Hancock said the technique was ""cost-effective"" and the Cabinet Office would look at how to pick up the bill.The Lords had said switching from a parchment called vellum to archival paper could save about £80,000 a year.It said it had not received an offer from the government department and so would proceed with the original plans.""If the Cabinet Office write offering to take on the responsibility for printing Acts of Parliament on vellum, it would of course be considered.""As of yet, that offer has not been made,"" a spokesman said.Two copies are made of Acts of Parliament. One is stored in the National Archives and the other in the Parliamentary Archives.Significant state documents - such as Magna Carta and thousands of Acts of Parliament - have traditionally been recorded on goat or calf skin.MPs had handed the decision to end the practice to the House of Lords, which is responsible for the cost of vellums for Parliament, and peers decided to push ahead with the cost-cutting measure.The House of Lords said vellum was ""extremely expensive"" and the cost of printing copies of laws on it - which it put at £100,000 a year ""cannot be justified"".""Archival quality paper is an extremely high quality and durable alternative,"" said chairman of committees Lord Laming.The Commons Administration Committee backed the Lords' proposal, saying it was ""convinced by the arguments"".However, it encountered criticism from MPs, with Conservative James Gray calling for the ""retrograde decision"" to be reversed.Mr Hancock told the Daily Telegraph: ""Recording laws on vellum is a millennium-long traditions and surprisingly cost-effective.""While the world constantly changes, we should safeguard some of our great traditions.""In 1999, the House of Lords decided in favour of scrapping the use of vellum - but the move was rejected in the Commons by 121 votes to 53, a majority of 68."

2016-02-16,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen.

In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip.

She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-16,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-16,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-16,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-16,Making headlines,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35590736,"As David Cameron continues his push to secure European leaders' backing for his EU reform demands, the media in several European countries look fearfully on the prospect of a possible Brexit.Several French papers focused on the UK PM's talks with French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday evening, in the final run-up to the European summit due to take place in Brussels at the end of this week.A headline in L'Express refers to the ""final marathon negotiations"". The paper says that despite official statements claiming that draft proposals for reforming Britain's EU membership provide a ""firm basis"" for a deal this week, the Cameron-Hollande talks had done little to tone down the differences between London and Paris.Le Monde also says ""major differences"" between London and Paris persist.A gloomy opinion piece in Le Monde by Guillaume Klossa, the founder of a pro-EU think-tank, is headlined ""Brexit: Neither a yes vote nor a no vote will save the EU from a major crisis"". Mr Klossa predicts that if British voters decide to leave the EU, other Eurosceptic countries within the bloc will be tempted to organise similar referendums, which will put at risk ""the very survival of the European project"" and could ""plunge Europe into the worst chaos in its history since the end of the second world war"".In Germany, the news website Focus also says Mr Cameron failed to achieve a breakthrough in his talks with Mr Hollande. Headlines in other German media focus on fears of the potential negative effect of a Brexit on trade and industry within the EU.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says that a ""majority of business owners fear Brexit"", while Der Spiegel notes that ""industry warns against Brexit"" In an article headlined ""Domino principle? Europe fears Brexit contagion"", the Hungarian paper Magyar Nemzet picks up on British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's recent remark that the UK's departure from the EU could trigger a wave of similar exits. The Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza takes a relatively sanguine view of the prospect of a Brexit. In an article headlined ""Will the world come to an end?"", the paper concludes: ""If Britons vote to end their relations with the EU, the sky will not fall down and the oceans will not flood our lands. Well, at least we hope that the world will not end."" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2016-02-16,Bowing to the inevitable,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35581401,"This afternoon Number 10 has bowed to the inevitable, and conceded that if (and it is still an if) the deal is done at the EU summit in Brussels this week David Cameron will hold a cabinet meeting as soon as he returns to London early on Friday evening.A few weeks ago we reported very real concerns about the choreography in the aftermath of the summit from Eurosceptic cabinet ministers, worried that the PM would be setting the pace and terms of the debate in its vital early hours. While they didn't commit officially to a position, the sense in Downing Street was that there was no need to shift cabinet from its usual Tuesday spot.They hoped and expected that cabinet ministers who wanted to campaign for exit would keep their counsel until then, when the government had adopted its official position. But in truth, at least one senior figure had already resolved to break their silence and reveal their plan to campaign for Out over the weekend, in defiance of Number 10.With that knowledge, and several frank conversations with Eurosceptic ministers, David Cameron's team have decided to relent. This is not just a story for political process nerds (honest), but it illustrates how Eurosceptics, although in a clear minority in the cabinet, have been able to force Downing Street's hand.This week's summit and now, the 24 hours that follow, are shaping up to be some of the most important in David Cameron's political career.

2016-02-16,Risk of a ‘non’,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35580517,"Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris shortly - the latest leg in his drive to negotiate new EU membership terms for the UK.After the draft deal was published two weeks ago, an irate editorial in the French newspaper Le Monde fumed that the concessions made to Britain were ""exorbitant"". And while some in Mr Cameron's own Conservative Party dismiss his renegotiation as a watery fudge, politicians in Paris have a very different view. Of particular concern here is the question of future financial regulation. UK ministers, too, think this is the most important part of the whole renegotiation. The issue is this: The majority of EU countries that have the euro are integrating further and building a banking union with common rules and regulations. That process will deepen in the coming years. Mr Cameron wants legal guarantees that the eurozone will not rig the rules in a way that could harm the interests of countries that do not have the euro. But France frets that the UK is seeking special treatment for the City of London, that could harm the single market in financial services. France is also concerned a new mechanism that would allow non-euro countries to escalate their concerns could clog up decision-making. The UK insists it is not asking for any veto or competitive advantage, but this is likely to be the focus of the hastily arranged talks here this evening. President Hollande also faces an election next year - and while he wants the UK to stay in the EU, he will not do a deal that gives his opponents a chance to claim he sold out to Britain.

2016-02-16,Victory for vellum,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35569281,"After a reprieve, the UK is to continue printing and storing its laws on vellum, made from calf or goat-skin. But shouldn't these traditions give way to digital storage, asks Chris Stokel-Walker. Last week the House of Lords decided to end the printing of laws on vellum for cost reasons. But now the Cabinet Office is to provide the money from its own budget for the thousand-year-old tradition to continue.Vellum lasts a long time. Dig into the archives of the UK's parliament and pull out the oldest extant law and you'll find a very old document. It was first inscribed in 1497. Over time, ordinary paper can deteriorate rapidly, while vellum is said to retain its integrity for much longer. Original copies of the Magna Carta, signed more than 800 years ago on vellum, still exist.The proposed change was a move to higher-quality archival paper. But are politicians missing the point?Sharon McMeekin, of the Digital Preservation Coalition, an advocacy and advice group for digital recordkeeping, thinks so.""People have been bemoaning the loss of history by changing to archival paper,"" she explains. ""I think people are missing the point there. Truly representing the context and history in which these records were made require them to be kept in a digital format. It's more representative of the technologies and communication methods used today.""So why in the digital age do we keep physical records of documents at all?There's a simple answer, says Adrian Brown, the director of parliamentary archives, who oversees a collection including 8km-worth of physical records of parchment, paper and photographs in the 325ft tall Victoria Tower at the western edge of the Palace of Westminster. In the tower, scrolls of vellum are piled up in a vast repository, spooled in a range of different sizes, looking superficially much as they would have done hundreds of years ago.""We simply respond to the way parliament chooses to create its records,"" Brown says. ""In this case those are still going to be physical - though the proportion that is digital will increase over time.""But there are other reasons, too.""In many circles there's still a real discomfort around digital archiving, and a lack of belief that digital can survive into the future,"" explains Jenny Mitcham, digital archivist at the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York.The whole concept of digital storage is a relatively new innovation, and the path by which it could survive through the years is not clear. ""We don't have the ability to look back and say we know for a fact in 200 years time we'll still have this stuff,"" reasons Mitcham. ""We can't prove that fact without a time machine.""Vellum is made from calf-skin. The word shares its derivation with the word ""veal"" from the old French ""velin"" (Collins Dictionary) or ""veelin"" (Petit Robert).  Vellum is made by first soaking calf-skin in a lime wash, says calligrapher and illuminator Patricia Lovett. The lime causes the hair follicles to expand, making it easier to scrape fat and fur from the skin. This is done with a curved-bladed knife called a ""scudder"". The prepared skin is then washed and stretched onto a wooden frame, and scraped further with a lunar knife to raise the nap and create a more even thickness. Finally the skin is left to dry; the length of time depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and the individual qualities of the skin.   Patricia Lovett, calligrapherWatch vellum being made on BBC 4's Illuminations: The Private Lives of Medieval KingsThere's an excellent example of how a digital archive can quickly run into problems.Between 1984-86 the BBC Domesday Project engaged more than a million people from around Britain. Children at more than 9,000 schools helped compile a statistical survey, personal thoughts and memories. The data was stored on special laserdiscs, then seen as a technology of the future.Nearly two decades later, there were virtually no extant disc players able to read the specially formatted discs. After a lot of work, the data was made readable, but the case for digital archiving had suffered a setback. ""Examples like that imply that digital is more fragile than physical,"" Mitcham laments.Mike Tibbetts, one of the two creators of the Domesday Project, wrote in 2008 that ""the fault in all this lies not in the lack of vision or foresight by the technologists but that, at least in the UK, the national systems of data preservation and heritage archiving simply don't work reliably or consistently.""This is the issue, according to Jenny Mitcham. Just as preserving a physical archive requires careful consideration of temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure to prevent paper from turning brittle and breaking, so digital archives need to be tended to.""There's certainly truth in the fact that if [a] digital [format] is neglected, it'll become obsolete,"" she says. ""But if it's brought into a digital archive, and that digital archive is well set up and knows what it's doing, migrating and actively managing files over time, the chances those files will be readable in the future are vastly improved.""Adrian Brown lists the difficulties in maintaining paper records - ""decay, chemical changes that happen in the physical items; you've got insects and animal damage; the effects of temperature and light and humidity and dust. Tearing, rubbing, those kinds of issues.""But with digital, there are different risks. ""One of the things about digital information is that it's not fundamentally human-readable,"" he explains. ""You need some kind of technology to turn it into something understandable. Technology as we know changes very rapidly; what you can find is your way of turning those 1s and 0s into meaningful information can be threatened if you don't take precautions.""And, as anyone who has lost beloved holiday snaps to a hard drive failure knows, IT systems are far from infallible.""With digital, the last thing you want to do is put it somewhere and leave it alone,"" Mitcham says. ""There are things you need to do over time to make sure everything's OK with it."" Documents are migrated from one file format to another as old versions of applications become outdated. It's also necessary to check information hasn't been lost in the transition. Backup copies are continuously made, and placed in different locations. Checksums, a process to make sure errors have not wormed their way into files, are run weekly.So archives are indeed moving from pieces of paper to bits and bytes. The British Library keep a physical copy of every book, magazine and newspaper printed in the United Kingdom as part of the principle of ""legal deposit"", a law which has existed since 1662. But since 2013, electronic records of websites, blogs, CDs and electronic journals have also come under the catchment of the legal deposit law. Advocates point out digital records have their advantages over paper documents. Metadata associated with electronic files can give an insight into the messy creation of a work, rather than a polished final document. It's sometimes possible to view how long someone spent typing up a record, and even to see what they changed between drafts. And just as with 500-year-old vellum, there's history in our hard drives, too.""I get excited by digital archaeology,"" Mitcham admits. ""If you find a pile of 5¼ inch floppy disks, I get a buzz out of that. Being able to find out what's on those discs, look through old Wordstar files, and get an idea for how computing has moved on through time, that's fascinating.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox."
2016-02-16,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160216213233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands. Randolph was heard to say: ""I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."""

2016-02-17,EU has no choice over reforms - Tusk,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35592466,"EU leaders have ""no choice"" but to do a deal on David Cameron's reforms, European Council President Donald Tusk has told BBC News. Mr Tusk will chair a crucial summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday on the controversial proposals. Poland and three other countries are reported to be still resisting welfare curbs while France is thought to be against financial regulation changes.A new draft deal is due to be published later, ahead of the two-day summit.Asked by the BBC's Ben Wright whether he would get a deal, Mr Tusk said: ""I am sure that we have no choice.""In a letter to the leaders of the 28 member states, Mr Tusk said the summit ""will be a crucial moment for the unity of our Union and for the future of the United Kingdom's relations within Europe"".""After my consultations in the last hours I have to state frankly: there is still no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. ""We differ on some political issues and I am fully aware that it will be difficult to overcome them. Therefore I urge you to remain constructive.""He said the negotiations were at a ""very advanced"" stage and failure now ""would be a defeat both for the UK and the European Union, but a geopolitical victory for those who seek to divide us"".Mr Cameron is working on a separate plan to boost UK sovereignty aimed at getting sceptical Tories, including Boris Johnson, to get behind his reform deal.Mr Johnson - who is being touted as a possible leader of the out campaign - has met Mr Cameron at Downing Street.""I'll be back,"" he told reporters as he left Number 10, adding: ""No deal, as far as I know.""BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the London mayor, who is ""pivotal"" to Mr Cameron's plans, would keep the PM waiting until he had returned from the summit before announcing which camp he would support, although his ""no deal"" comment was not thought to be a reference to his own concerns about sovereignty.Sources close to Mr Johnson say his decision on whether to back remaining in or leaving the EU is ""very finely balanced"".They say the decision by Mr Cameron to try to sell his proposed deal to Mr Johnson underlines how crucial he is likely to be if the prime minister is to win the referendum.""They are pretty determined to get him on board,"" the source added.They have strongly rejected suggestions that Mr Johnson's decision is tied to his ambitions to lead the Conservative Party when Mr Cameron steps down.""His decision is in no way predicated on any leadership question. It's based on what he thinks will be in the best interests of the country,"" the source said.Mr Cameron's sovereignty plan is expected to suggest extra powers for the UK Supreme Court to protect UK law from challenges from the European Court of Justice, to assert the primacy of UK law over Brussels.Wednesday:20:00 GMT: European Council President Donald Tusk, who is charged with delivering the reform deal, has dinner with Commission President Jean Claude JunckerA new draft of the whole reform package will be published on the European Council website on Wednesday evening - but controversial issues such as welfare curbs and exempting the UK from ""ever closer union"" will still need to be finalised by the leaders at the summitThursday:15:00: EU leaders begin arriving for their regular summit at the European Council headquarters in Brussels16:45: First working session on the UK proposed reforms19:00: Working dinner on the migration crisisTalks on the UK deal could resume after dinner and continue late into the night, if there is still no dealFriday:08:00: Discussions will continue over an ""English Breakfast"" if no agreement on the UK demands has been reached on Thursday If David Cameron gets a deal, he will hold an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday evening to reach an agreed position on remaining in the EU, although ministers will be free to campaign against that in a personal capacityMr Cameron may then announce the date of the UK's referendum, although he does not have to do so17 March: The next scheduled EU summit - Mr Cameron has another chance to get a deal here.

It is the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1999, the ONS says.Last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney signalled that a rise in interest rates would not be imminent as global economic growth slowed. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the US economy added 151,000 jobs in January, helping to push the country's unemployment rate down to 4.9%.However, the US number was lower than expected and was a sharp slowdown from December, when 292,000 jobs were added.Unemployment in the eurozone dropped in December to its lowest rate in more than four years, despite worries about the global economy.Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency, said the jobless rate in the 19 country eurozone had fallen to 10.4% from 10.5% in November."

""As long as Britain's trade policy is controlled by the EU, we cannot sign bilateral free trade agreements with Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand or for that matter any other non-EU state. ""Vested interests on the Continent sustain a relatively protectionist policy. We have to apply the EU's common external tariff to exports from Commonwealth countries - hurting consumers here as well as producers there.""At the same time, our immigration policy forces us, in effect, to turn away qualified workers from the Commonwealth so as to free up unlimited space for migrants from the EU. ""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom.""One of the signatories, Pasha Khandaker, president of the UK Bangladesh Caterers Association UK, said the 12,000 curry houses his organisation represents ""have been struggling to recruit the talent that they need because of the difficulties associated with employing people from outside of the EU"". ""If the UK had a fairer immigration system it would be easier for businesses to recruit skilled workers regardless of their nationality,"" he added.Other signatories include Rachel Kerr, who won a Mobo award in 2012, in the gospel music category, and Moni Verma, founder of Veetee Rice, a UK-based food business with a turnover of £80m a year.A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said: ""Several Commonwealth leaders have been very clear that Britain is stronger, safer and better off in Europe. ""Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Britain is the entry point for trade right across Europe; while Australia's former deputy prime minister said the Commonwealth could never replace the trade Britain does with the EU.""We get the best of both worlds in Europe, trading freely with the world's largest market, as well as accessing free trade deals with over 50 countries around the globe. ""While Leave campaigners may look back with rose-tinted spectacles, they have no plan for what Britain outside the EU would look like, and no guarantee that trade, jobs and prices wouldn't be hit.""In a separate development, 63% of business people polled by the British Chambers of Commerce said David Cameron's EU negotiations would not change the way they will vote in the referendum.The internet survey of 2,133 BCC members found 60% would vote to remain, down slightly from 63% in a previous poll in September, with 30% saying they would vote to leave, a 3% increase.Those representing large firms were significantly more likely to vote 'remain' than small-business people.BCC director general John Longworth said: ""Our findings suggest that for business people, this is a question of in or out - not renegotiation."""
2016-02-17,Greek islands to house more migrants,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35594705,"Greece is starting to register migrants at four new reception centres on islands near Turkey, in line with a demand from the EU.Five were supposed to have been completed by the end of last year. The fifth - on Kos - is not yet ready. On Tuesday Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos visited the new centres - called ""hotspots"" - on Leros and Chios. Two more are on Lesbos and Samos.Greece says the influx of migrants from Turkey has diminished in recent days.Converted shipping containers and prefab shelters are being used to house thousands of migrants on the Greek islands. The EU says they must all be registered there and fingerprinted before going anywhere else.Last year more than 850,000 migrants - mostly refugees fleeing war and abuses in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - entered Greece as a gateway to the EU. Greece has been heavily criticised by EU partners for failing to register many of the migrants before they travel north through the EU. Germany is the target destination for most of them.EU border staff are helping Greece now.Greece says its EU partners must share the burden of accommodating migrants. It refuses to become a sort of holding centre for the rest of Europe.Last week the EU set Greece a deadline of three months to fix its border controls, amid fears of another migration surge from Turkey when the weather improves. The crisis has put the EU's Schengen passport-free travel zone at risk. One after another, Schengen countries have imposed temporary border controls.European Council President Donald Tusk says expelling Greece from Schengen would in no way solve the EU's migrant crisis.The crisis will be high on the EU's agenda at a Brussels summit on Thursday.Schengen: EU free movement deal explainedMacedonia tries to stop migrant flowA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
2016-02-17,May warns of extremism link to migration,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35592457,"Extremism is contributing to and exploiting mass migration, the home secretary has warned.Theresa May used a speech in Washington to urge the UK's partners in the Five Eyes security alliance - the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to work together against terrorism.Mrs May called for better information-sharing and more thorough exchange of terrorist finance details.She said tackling terrorism was the ""challenge of our generation"".Mrs May called on the UK's partners in the Fives Eye alliance to extend ""the successful co-operation between our countries on issues of national security which we have built over past decades"". ""I am clear that defeating terrorism requires a global response, and that we will not succeed by acting in isolation,"" Mrs May said.She challenged the alliance to:""Extremism is spreading, threatening and taking lives, not just in our countries but in other lands. It thrives in the disorder created by fragile and failing states.""It is contributing to, and in some cases exploiting, mass migration. It is turning the benefits of modern technology to its twisted ends,"" she added.Fears have previously been raised that militants from the so-called Islamic State group may be attempting to get into Europe posing as refugees.Last month a report by EU's police agency Europol said there was no ""concrete evidence"" that militants were using the flow of refugees to enter unnoticed but it said there were reports that refugee centres were being ""specifically targeted"" by Islamic extremist recruiters."
2016-02-17,UK inflation rises to 0.3% in January,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35586431,"UK inflation edged up to a 12 month high in January, as a fall in petrol prices eased.Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rose by 0.3%. It was helped by smaller falls in food and fuel prices than a year ago.Annual inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2% target for two years, and last year it was zero.The BoE said earlier this month that it expected inflation to stay below 1% this year.North Sea oil prices dropped to a 12 year low of $27.10 last month and have almost halved over the past 12 months.But the Office for National Statistics measure of fuels and lubricants costs was only 7.3% lower than in January 2015, the smallest drop since November 2014.Continuing low inflation makes the chance of an interest rate rise in the near future unlikely.Few economists expect the BoE to raise rates before late this year at the earliest, and some analysts see a risk that the BoE could instead have cut to rates below the record low of 0.5% where they have been for almost seven years.Financial markets do not currently expect interest rates to rise until the end of the decade due to concerns including a global economic slowdown and continuing low oil prices.Food prices fell by 0.6% between December and January as opposed to a 1% fall a year earlier.Supermarkets have been engaged in a long-running price war, and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl continue to take market share from the ""big four"" supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisions.But the ONS said alcohol prices rose 5.2% between December and January, with spirits increasing by 7.5%, beer climbing by 3.6%, and wine up 4.8%."
2016-02-17,EDF extends life of UK nuclear plants,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35583740,"French energy firm EDF will extend the life of four of its eight nuclear power plants in the UK.The move will safeguard 2,000 jobs and help with tight energy supplies.Heysham 1 and Hartlepool will have their life extended by five years until 2024, while Heysham 2 and Torness will see their closure dates pushed back by seven years to 2030.Meanwhile, EDF said its 2015 profits fell 68% to €1.18bn mainly due to writedowns on coal-fired plants.The results were below analysts' expectations.The value of plants in the UK, Italy, Poland and Belgium fell, and the company also took charges on its Edison oil and gas exploration business.EDF will cut its dividend by 15 cents to €1.10 a share with an option for payment in new shares rather than cash.Its shares have fallen almost 25% since the start of the year.EDF said its decision to extend the life of its plants followed ""extensive technical and safety reviews"".Chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said: ""Our continuing investment, our expertise and the professional relationship we have with the safety regulator means we can safely prolong the operating life of our nuclear power stations.   ""Their excellent output shows that reliability is improving whilst their safety and environmental performance is higher than ever.""The four nuclear plants employ about 2,000 permanent staff and 1,000 contractors.They provide electricity to about a quarter of the UK's homes.The announcement comes amid concern about the amount of energy available to keep the lights on, due to the closure of many of Britain's ageing power plants.Meanwhile, EDF has yet to finalise the investment for a new nuclear plant to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset.It has agreed a deal in principle under which China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) will pay a third of the cost of the £18bn project in exchange for a 33.5% stake.An EDF board meeting to approve the plan earlier this year is thought to have been postponed. Reports suggested the company was struggling to find the cash for its 66.5% stake.The company said on Tuesday: ""Hinkley Point C is a strong project which is fully ready for a final investment decision and successful construction. Final steps are well in hand to enable the full construction phase to be launched very soon.""However, Paul Dorfman of the UCL Energy Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Unfortunately, with the best will in the world, it may just not happen. Chris Bakken, the man charged by EDF to construct Hinkley Point, has quit to spend more time with his family, EDF shares have crashed to half their value a year ago; the budget for Hinkley alone is bigger than EDF's entire market value. ""Areva - EDF's construction arm - has been bankrupted by the huge costs and time overruns for the same brand of reactor they want to build at Hinkley, so it seems there's a good chance that it simply may not happen."""

Businessman Richard Tice, from Leave.EU, is expected to be chairman.It said its application for official designation had the support of Conservative, Labour, DUP and UKIP politicians.""Each of these groups is represented with their own GO groups, headed up by the David Davis MP, Kate Hoey MP, Sammy Wilson MP, and Nigel Farage MEP, respectively,"" it said.However, the DUP denied it was involved in the group, accusing GO Movement of ""utter codswallop"" for saying it was.""We are appalled with them. This is not the way people who want to cooperate to achieve Brexit should behave,"" a DUP spokesman said.The UK's EU vote: All you need to knowGO Movement claimed that Vote Leave - a rival umbrella group which includes business leaders, Tory MPs and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell among others - was considering whether to join, but it is believed there have been no formal discussions.A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""We wish this new campaign well and are willing to work with anyone who wishes to campaign to leave the EU.""Previous merger attempts between Leave.EU and Vote Leave were scuppered by what appeared to be personality clashes and differences on tactics.Mr Farage, Mr Bone and Mr Pursglove are expected to attend a Grassroots Out rally on Friday following the conclusion of the key Brussels summit.Britain Stronger in Europe, which campaigns for the UK's continued membership of the 28-member bloc, is the main group vying to become the official 'Remain' campaign.

2016-02-17,Sheltered housing 'hit by benefit cuts',https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35583415,"Hundreds of planned new sheltered accommodation units have been delayed or scrapped owing to proposed cuts to housing benefit, the BBC has learned.Several housing associations have said they are no longer financially viable. The flats, for the elderly or people with learning disabilities, are more expensive to build and run because they provide additional support.Ministers say they are reviewing the sheltered housing sector ""to ensure it works in the best way possible"".The National Housing Federation (NHF) has calculated that nearly 2,500 units have so far been scrapped or delayed as sheltered housing providers face losing an average of £68 a week per tenant.  David Orr, chief executive of the NHF, told the BBC: ""There is real impact now.""New homes for people with support needs - vulnerable people - that would be being built have been cancelled."" BBC News has spoken to four housing associations who confirmed their plans had needed to change:The changes - announced in Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement - will bring housing benefit rates for social housing in line with the sums paid to landlords in the private sector.Mr Osborne said the move, which will affect England, Scotland and Wales, would deliver savings of £225m by 2020-21, and is part of a £12bn package of cuts from the welfare bill.The cap includes sheltered housing, which is more expensive to provide due to the additional support on offer - anything from canteens to round-the-clock care staff.The benefit will not actually be cut until April 2018 but it will affect people signing new tenancies from this April. At one sheltered housing complex in Harrogate, the need for new development is clear - there is only one lift and the corridors are narrow.  ""We need to move,"" said resident Frank Forkes. ""It's very cramped. If the lift breaks down, it's chaos because you've people upstairs in wheelchairs.""  The housing association has spent eight years developing plans for a new complex a couple of miles away. But following the government's announcement in November, the board of Harrogate Neighbours delayed the scheme. Under the new rules, they will lose £100,000 per annum on it.  ""As an organisation we have to be absolutely certain that we can afford to deliver all the services. And at the moment, it's not viable,"" chief executive Sue Cawthray said.  The consequences of the benefit cuts are even worse for Contour Homes in Manchester. ""We stand to lose - over the course of the 40-year life cycle of the development - if things stay as they are, £3.35m. As an organisation, we couldn't just absorb that,"" director of customer services Chris Langan said.  Labour described the housing benefit cut as a ""catastrophe for those who can least afford it"".But a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We've always been clear that we value the work the supported accommodation sector does to protect the most vulnerable members of society. ""That's why we are carrying out a thorough review, working with the sector, to ensure that it works in the best way possible - which is what the NHF has asked for.""We are also providing councils with £870m of Discretionary Housing Payments which can be paid to people in supported accommodation.""

The Brittan family said she had asked the commissioner 30 questions, which he had promised to answer in writing.Scotland Yard has acknowledged the Conservative peer's widow should have been told six months earlier that, had he been alive, he would not have been prosecuted.Investigating officers had told the alleged victim this in April 2015, a Met report into the handling of the case revealed, but Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time.The force apologised for this in a letter last year.  BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw pointed out that, while Sir Bernard said he had ""confirmed the apology"" at Tuesday's meeting, Lord Brittan's family suggested he had gone further by offering Lady Brittan ""a full apology"".  Speaking after the meeting, Sir Bernard said in a statement that he and Lady Brittan had had ""a private, but constructive conversation"". ""I confirmed the apology we made some months ago now, which is an apology for not telling her at an earlier stage about the fact the Lord Brittan, who by that stage had unfortunately died, was not to be prosecuted as there was no chance of a successful prosecution. ""I thought it was important to meet her and it was a very precise apology for the reasons that have previously been given."" Former home secretary Lord Brittan has also been the subject of a separate investigation as part of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard's inquiry into allegations of a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster. The Brittan family said in a statement: ""At the start of the meeting Sir Bernard offered Lady Brittan a full apology on behalf of the force, which she accepted.""Lady Brittan went on to ask and table some 30 questions regarding the two police inquiries as they related to Lord Brittan.""Sir Bernard promised to answer them in writing and Lady Brittan and the family await his response.""Lady Brittan and the family have nothing further to add at least until they have received Sir Bernard's written response.""Sir Bernard said he would respond within weeks, but added: ""We'll try and do it in days.""He told BBC London that Operation Midland had not yet been concluded and historical allegations of this sort took time to investigate.  ""People say: 'Why don't you complete these things quicker?'""Well, one of the difficulties being that new witnesses come forward during the investigation. We've had to explore what they've said.""The Crown Prosecution Service advised the police in August 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967 - but the case was nonetheless reopened less than a year later. Police interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought. Lord Brittan died in January 2015. Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.A Met spokesman also said that notifying the complainant in April had been ""premature"", because the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June 2015.Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but a review - carried out by Dorset Police and published earlier this month - found its investigation of the claim was ""fully justified"".Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January 2015, aged 75."

2016-02-17,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005.

2016-02-17,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-17,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-17,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During last year's election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording.

Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-17,Making headlines,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35590736,"As David Cameron continues his push to secure European leaders' backing for his EU reform demands, the media in several European countries look fearfully on the prospect of a possible Brexit.Several French papers focused on the UK PM's talks with French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday evening, in the final run-up to the European summit due to take place in Brussels at the end of this week.A headline in L'Express refers to the ""final marathon negotiations"". The paper says that despite official statements claiming that draft proposals for reforming Britain's EU membership provide a ""firm basis"" for a deal this week, the Cameron-Hollande talks had done little to tone down the differences between London and Paris.Le Monde also says ""major differences"" between London and Paris persist.A gloomy opinion piece in Le Monde by Guillaume Klossa, the founder of a pro-EU think-tank, is headlined ""Brexit: Neither a yes vote nor a no vote will save the EU from a major crisis"". Mr Klossa predicts that if British voters decide to leave the EU, other Eurosceptic countries within the bloc will be tempted to organise similar referendums, which will put at risk ""the very survival of the European project"" and could ""plunge Europe into the worst chaos in its history since the end of the second world war"".In Germany, the news website Focus also says Mr Cameron failed to achieve a breakthrough in his talks with Mr Hollande. Headlines in other German media focus on fears of the potential negative effect of a Brexit on trade and industry within the EU.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says that a ""majority of business owners fear Brexit"", while Der Spiegel notes that ""industry warns against Brexit"" In an article headlined ""Domino principle? Europe fears Brexit contagion"", the Hungarian paper Magyar Nemzet picks up on British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's recent remark that the UK's departure from the EU could trigger a wave of similar exits. The Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza takes a relatively sanguine view of the prospect of a Brexit. In an article headlined ""Will the world come to an end?"", the paper concludes: ""If Britons vote to end their relations with the EU, the sky will not fall down and the oceans will not flood our lands. Well, at least we hope that the world will not end."" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

While they didn't commit officially to a position, the sense in Downing Street was that there was no need to shift cabinet from its usual Tuesday spot.They hoped and expected that cabinet ministers who wanted to campaign for exit would keep their counsel until then, when the government had adopted its official position. But in truth, at least one senior figure had already resolved to break their silence and reveal their plan to campaign for Out over the weekend, in defiance of Number 10.With that knowledge, and several frank conversations with Eurosceptic ministers, David Cameron's team have decided to relent. This is not just a story for political process nerds (honest), but it illustrates how Eurosceptics, although in a clear minority in the cabinet, have been able to force Downing Street's hand.This week's summit and now, the 24 hours that follow, are shaping up to be some of the most important in David Cameron's political career.

2016-02-17,Risk of a ‘non’,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35580517,"Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris shortly - the latest leg in his drive to negotiate new EU membership terms for the UK.After the draft deal was published two weeks ago, an irate editorial in the French newspaper Le Monde fumed that the concessions made to Britain were ""exorbitant"". And while some in Mr Cameron's own Conservative Party dismiss his renegotiation as a watery fudge, politicians in Paris have a very different view. Of particular concern here is the question of future financial regulation. UK ministers, too, think this is the most important part of the whole renegotiation. The issue is this: The majority of EU countries that have the euro are integrating further and building a banking union with common rules and regulations. That process will deepen in the coming years. Mr Cameron wants legal guarantees that the eurozone will not rig the rules in a way that could harm the interests of countries that do not have the euro. But France frets that the UK is seeking special treatment for the City of London, that could harm the single market in financial services. France is also concerned a new mechanism that would allow non-euro countries to escalate their concerns could clog up decision-making. The UK insists it is not asking for any veto or competitive advantage, but this is likely to be the focus of the hastily arranged talks here this evening. President Hollande also faces an election next year - and while he wants the UK to stay in the EU, he will not do a deal that gives his opponents a chance to claim he sold out to Britain.

2016-02-17,Victory for vellum,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35569281,"After a reprieve, the UK is to continue printing and storing its laws on vellum, made from calf or goat-skin. But shouldn't these traditions give way to digital storage, asks Chris Stokel-Walker. Last week the House of Lords decided to end the printing of laws on vellum for cost reasons. But now the Cabinet Office is to provide the money from its own budget for the thousand-year-old tradition to continue.Vellum lasts a long time. Dig into the archives of the UK's parliament and pull out the oldest extant law and you'll find a very old document. It was first inscribed in 1497. Over time, ordinary paper can deteriorate rapidly, while vellum is said to retain its integrity for much longer. Original copies of the Magna Carta, signed more than 800 years ago on vellum, still exist.The proposed change was a move to higher-quality archival paper. But are politicians missing the point?Sharon McMeekin, of the Digital Preservation Coalition, an advocacy and advice group for digital recordkeeping, thinks so.""People have been bemoaning the loss of history by changing to archival paper,"" she explains. ""I think people are missing the point there. Truly representing the context and history in which these records were made require them to be kept in a digital format. It's more representative of the technologies and communication methods used today.""So why in the digital age do we keep physical records of documents at all?There's a simple answer, says Adrian Brown, the director of parliamentary archives, who oversees a collection including 8km-worth of physical records of parchment, paper and photographs in the 325ft tall Victoria Tower at the western edge of the Palace of Westminster. In the tower, scrolls of vellum are piled up in a vast repository, spooled in a range of different sizes, looking superficially much as they would have done hundreds of years ago.""We simply respond to the way parliament chooses to create its records,"" Brown says. ""In this case those are still going to be physical - though the proportion that is digital will increase over time.""But there are other reasons, too.""In many circles there's still a real discomfort around digital archiving, and a lack of belief that digital can survive into the future,"" explains Jenny Mitcham, digital archivist at the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York.The whole concept of digital storage is a relatively new innovation, and the path by which it could survive through the years is not clear. ""We don't have the ability to look back and say we know for a fact in 200 years time we'll still have this stuff,"" reasons Mitcham. ""We can't prove that fact without a time machine.""Vellum is made from calf-skin. The word shares its derivation with the word ""veal"" from the old French ""velin"" (Collins Dictionary) or ""veelin"" (Petit Robert).  Vellum is made by first soaking calf-skin in a lime wash, says calligrapher and illuminator Patricia Lovett. The lime causes the hair follicles to expand, making it easier to scrape fat and fur from the skin. This is done with a curved-bladed knife called a ""scudder"". The prepared skin is then washed and stretched onto a wooden frame, and scraped further with a lunar knife to raise the nap and create a more even thickness. Finally the skin is left to dry; the length of time depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and the individual qualities of the skin.   Patricia Lovett, calligrapherWatch vellum being made on BBC 4's Illuminations: The Private Lives of Medieval KingsThere's an excellent example of how a digital archive can quickly run into problems.Between 1984-86 the BBC Domesday Project engaged more than a million people from around Britain. Children at more than 9,000 schools helped compile a statistical survey, personal thoughts and memories. The data was stored on special laserdiscs, then seen as a technology of the future.Nearly two decades later, there were virtually no extant disc players able to read the specially formatted discs. After a lot of work, the data was made readable, but the case for digital archiving had suffered a setback. ""Examples like that imply that digital is more fragile than physical,"" Mitcham laments.Mike Tibbetts, one of the two creators of the Domesday Project, wrote in 2008 that ""the fault in all this lies not in the lack of vision or foresight by the technologists but that, at least in the UK, the national systems of data preservation and heritage archiving simply don't work reliably or consistently.""This is the issue, according to Jenny Mitcham. Just as preserving a physical archive requires careful consideration of temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure to prevent paper from turning brittle and breaking, so digital archives need to be tended to.""There's certainly truth in the fact that if [a] digital [format] is neglected, it'll become obsolete,"" she says. ""But if it's brought into a digital archive, and that digital archive is well set up and knows what it's doing, migrating and actively managing files over time, the chances those files will be readable in the future are vastly improved.""Adrian Brown lists the difficulties in maintaining paper records - ""decay, chemical changes that happen in the physical items; you've got insects and animal damage; the effects of temperature and light and humidity and dust. Tearing, rubbing, those kinds of issues.""But with digital, there are different risks. ""One of the things about digital information is that it's not fundamentally human-readable,"" he explains. ""You need some kind of technology to turn it into something understandable. Technology as we know changes very rapidly; what you can find is your way of turning those 1s and 0s into meaningful information can be threatened if you don't take precautions.""And, as anyone who has lost beloved holiday snaps to a hard drive failure knows, IT systems are far from infallible.""With digital, the last thing you want to do is put it somewhere and leave it alone,"" Mitcham says. ""There are things you need to do over time to make sure everything's OK with it."" Documents are migrated from one file format to another as old versions of applications become outdated. It's also necessary to check information hasn't been lost in the transition. Backup copies are continuously made, and placed in different locations. Checksums, a process to make sure errors have not wormed their way into files, are run weekly.So archives are indeed moving from pieces of paper to bits and bytes. The British Library keep a physical copy of every book, magazine and newspaper printed in the United Kingdom as part of the principle of ""legal deposit"", a law which has existed since 1662. But since 2013, electronic records of websites, blogs, CDs and electronic journals have also come under the catchment of the legal deposit law. Advocates point out digital records have their advantages over paper documents. Metadata associated with electronic files can give an insight into the messy creation of a work, rather than a polished final document. It's sometimes possible to view how long someone spent typing up a record, and even to see what they changed between drafts. And just as with 500-year-old vellum, there's history in our hard drives, too.""I get excited by digital archaeology,"" Mitcham admits. ""If you find a pile of 5¼ inch floppy disks, I get a buzz out of that. Being able to find out what's on those discs, look through old Wordstar files, and get an idea for how computing has moved on through time, that's fascinating.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox."
2016-02-17,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160217204438/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands. Randolph was heard to say: ""I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."""

2016-02-18,'No progress' in Cameron's EU talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35599279,"Negotiations on David Cameron's EU reform demands have made ""no real progress"" so far, Downing Street sources say.The first EU Council session ended with no agreement on several issues as Number 10 played down hopes of a deal.EU sources said the talks were ""constructive"" but said other countries had spoken out against the PM's plans.Friday's session on the UK's demands has been put back to allow him to speak to individual leaders one-to-one.The 28 EU leaders are now holding a working dinner to discuss their response to the migration crisis.When talks return to the UK's reforms, Mr Cameron will seek to secure the deal which he wants before holding an in/out referendum on the UK's EU membership.However, he has said he will walk away from the summit without agreement unless he gets a ""credible"" package he can sell to voters in the referendum.The PM's Eurosceptic critics have branded the process a sham, saying that even if the reforms are agreed they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or affect the scale of EU migration.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a Downing Street source was claiming the talks had reached an ""impasse"".It is not clear whether the downbeat mood is ""summit theatrics or genuine disappointment"" that negotiations are not progressing, she added.An EU source spoke of five key areas where agreement has not been reached:Thursday's meeting was ""intense and constructive"", an EU source said, but while all the countries confirmed their wish for the UK to stay in, some also set out specific concerns.""We expected this,"" the EU source said: ""But honestly we had hoped for some of them to be less critical.""Earlier, senior EU officials talked up the chances of a deal, with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker saying he was ""quite confident"" during the Council meeting and Council president Donald Tusk saying it was a ""make-or-break summit"".Mr Cameron is now expected to meet Mr Tusk later to discuss how Friday's session will proceed.Speaking as he arrived at the summit, Mr Cameron said: ""I'll be battling for Britain. If we can get a good deal I'll take that deal. But I will not take a deal that doesn't meet what we need. ""I think it's much more important to get this right than to do anything in a rush. But with good will, with hard work, we can get a better deal for Britain.""The key parts of the UK deal include:France is thought to be resisting attempts to secure protection for the City of London by giving non-eurozone nations more power to stall financial regulation.Mr Cameron's plan to cut the amount of child benefit EU migrants can send back to to their home countries would apply across the EU according to leaked versions of a draft deal - something that would be resisted by Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorForget the fight over including one sentence or another, what goes in the square brackets or the footnotes of the deal.There are so many countries involved, so many complications in these talks, it's easy to lose the big truth.This is the best chance David Cameron has of getting a new deal with the European Union - there could always be another summit, more talks, more negotiations but there's no guarantee the terms would get any better for the UK. One senior UK diplomat told me: ""The deal is as cooked as it is going to get"".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he expected Mr Cameron to come back with a deal from Brussels, as the other leaders would recognise how ""embarrassing"" it would be for him to return empty-handed.But he added: ""He hasn't asked for us to get back supremacy for our Parliament, he hasn't asked for us to control our own borders, he hasn't asked to reduce the vast daily fees we pay. ""We will be allowed - after he has come here like Oliver Twist and begged for concessions - to control migrant benefits for up to four years. I find the whole thing as a British person pretty shameful.""Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan dismissed the proposed deal and warned that any changes could be unpicked by the European Parliament in future.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't know of any MEPs or Eurocrats in private who think that this is a fundamental change. All of the sound and fury, all of the negotiations, have come down to amending one directive - which we could have done at any time without needing any renegotiation.""Privately, the Eurocrats were whooping and high-fiving and turning cartwheels because so little has been asked for.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party will be campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU - but he branded David Cameron's renegotiations ""a theatrical sideshow, designed to appease his opponents within the Conservative Party"".By BBC Europe Editor Katya AdlerCivil servants and MEPs I've spoken to in Brussels believe the expected UK referendum and Britain's EU renegotiation essentially came about because the PM was under pressure from his own Conservative party.Yet in public, in the style of the Emperor's New Clothes, they go along with the idea that this is all for the British people.But then Brussels is used to dealing with two UKs: one on stage, the other behind the scenes. Successive UK prime ministers have been openly dismissive, disparaging, even hostile at EU summits, ""playing to their eurosceptic gallery at home,"" EU suits say knowingly, sotto voce, with a nod and a wink.More from KatyaJames Landale: How Cameron will get a June referendumThursday:19:00 (20:00 local): Working dinner on the migration crisisMr Cameron is expected to hold one-on-one talks with leaders to try to find agreementFriday:10:00: Group discussions will continue If David Cameron gets a deal, he will return to the UK as quickly as possible to hold an emergency cabinet meeting to reach an agreed position on remaining in the EU.

During last year's Labour leadership campaign, Mr Corbyn said he had ""mixed feelings"" on the union and suggested there were circumstances in which he would advocate a vote to leave.In September he confirmed Labour would campaign to stay in the EU but criticised it over free trade, agriculture and Greece.Speaking after the PES meeting, Mr Corbyn said Mr Cameron had ""brought an internal Conservative Party dispute to international proportions"".He said Labour had made its backing for EU membership ""very, very clear"" saying this was supported by the ""vast majority"" of its membership.His desired reforms, he said, were ""rather different"" to Mr Cameron's.""It has to be based on the rights of people all across Europe,"" he said.""I don't think David Cameron has that on his agenda."""

Kent Police officers will liaise closely with the Electoral Commission and investigate if appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said.The commission said it would specifically consider whether stays at the Royal Harbour Hotel in Ramsgate and the Premier Inn in Margate, should have been included in national campaign spending or not. ""The investigation opened by the commission today focuses on whether the Conservative Party met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act,"" a statement said.The commission's sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000.The allegations were first made by on 20 January and relate to how much an individual can spend on their campaign during an election.The commission said that during what was defined as the ""short campaign"" - which ran from 30 March to 7 May - £8,700 could be spent, plus 6p for every ""registered parliamentary elector"".In his blog Michael Crick - the political correspondent for Channel 4 - said the legal expense limit in Thanet South for that period was £15,016."
2016-02-18,Troops to Teachers sees 28 qualify,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35595424," A flagship scheme to bring ex-servicemen and women to England's classrooms has seen 28 veterans qualify as teachers since it started.Former Education Secretary Michael Gove had hoped to attract 2,000 applicants to the £4.3m Troops to Teachers scheme.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said the low numbers showed the government had failed to get a grip on the teacher shortage crisis.The government said the scheme's impact was positive and set to grow.It stressed the figures, revealed in a written answer to a parliamentary question, referred to the first round of trainees to graduate from the scheme.In another answer, schools minister Nick Gibb said a total of 551 applications had been received for the scheme, which began training people in 2014.This led to 41 individuals starting the programme in its first year. Since then 28 of the 29 who completed the programme had achieved qualified teacher status (QTS), he said.Ms Powell said: ""I very much want to see more veterans re-training to become teachers as they have a huge amount to offer and we desperately need more good teachers.  ""What's clear is that, as with the government's general slow response to teacher shortages, this scheme isn't working because the government isn't focusing on teacher recruitment.  ""We urgently need a proper strategy for teacher recruitment, including of veterans for whom this could make a great second career.""It was back in 2008 that the then shadow education secretary Michael Gove, backed a UK version of an American programme to get ex-servicemen teaching in England's schools.Within months of taking office, he announced plans for the Troops to Teachers programme.But the simplicity of the idea, giving soldiers leaving Afghanistan and Iraq future careers and getting a bit of military discipline in classrooms, has been belied by its delivery.Challenges lay in working across two government departments - education and defence.The programme is part of the DfE's commitment to the cross-government Military Covenant, which aims to help support service leavers get back into civilian life.Many applicants did not have the pre-requisite qualifications or could not stay the rather demanding course of becoming a teacher - despite their Army heroics.And as teaching unions have warned, there is no direct correlation between a good service record and being good teacher material.But ministers are convinced the scheme is good and that it can still be a success.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""The 28 graduates referred to are the first trainees to be recruited and completed their two-year course at the end of December. ""A further two cohorts are being trained right now which means that more than 140 former troops are working in our classrooms and record numbers of eligible applicants have applied for the latest cohort.""These figures relate to recruitment for 2016.The spokesman added: ""The impact of these recruits in the classroom has been overwhelmingly positive with head teachers praising the influence they've had on pupils' attainment.""It is not the first time the low take-up of the scheme has been in the news. In July 2014, the BBC News website reported the scheme had sent a total of 41 trainees to England's classrooms in its first year.The revelation comes just a week after a National Audit Office report highlighted how the government had missed its teacher recruitment targets for four years in a row.The Troops to Teachers scheme, run by the University of Brighton, is based on the idea that military values such as leadership, discipline, motivation and teamwork are particularly useful for teaching. First mooted in 2008, it provides non-graduate recruits with on-the-job training four days a week, with one day reserved for academic study.Trainees go straight into the school-based programme after a minimum of one week's work experience in a school. They start to teach after spending two terms observing.After two years, trainees count as ""newly qualified teachers"" and gain an honours degrees in education, specialising either as secondary school subject teachers or as primary school teachers. Some teaching unions criticised the entry requirements for the scheme and questioned the notion that a good service record meant a candidate would make a good teacher."

""How are such basic, avoidable mistakes still happening? There is clearly a lack of learning in the NHS.""It is especially unforgivable to operate on the wrong organ, and many such mistakes can never be rectified.""NHS England insisted never events were rare - affecting one in every 20,000 procedures - and that the majority of the 4.6 million hospital operations each year were safe.A spokeswoman said: ""One never event is too many and we mustn't underestimate the effect on the patients concerned. ""To better understand the reasons why, in 2013 we commissioned a taskforce to investigate, leading to a new set of national standards being published last year specifically to support doctors, nurses and hospitals to prevent these mistakes.""Any organisation that reports a serious incident is also expected to conduct its own investigation so it can learn and take action to prevent similar incidents from being repeated."""

Instead a review hearing will allow the Johnson family's lawyers to argue that further evidence about the culture in the Conservative Party at the time should be heard.Mr Johnson's father Ray, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: ""We want to ensure that the inquest covers all aspects surrounding Elliott's death.""The original intention had been to hold a relatively short one-and-a-half-hour inquest only hearing evidence from the police.""We've said there's more to this than simply what the police have reported and the coroner has agreed to hear our representations.""This will include additional evidence taking the whole episode back several weeks and months to reveal the full circumstances surrounding Elliott's state of mind.""The family have already decided they will not participate in an internal review by the Conservative Party, saying they do not want to lend credibility to a process they fear will be a whitewash.Elliott Johnson had alleged bullying a month before his death in September, sparking an investigation and the resignation of then party chairman Grant Shapps.The allegations centre on the activities of former activist Mark Clarke, who has since been expelled from the party. Mr Clarke has denied the allegations against him.Ray Johnson says his son's concerns were brought to the party's attention on 12 August. Elliott was found dead on railway tracks near Sandy station on 15 September."

It is the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1999, the ONS says.By Carole Walker, BBC political correspondent These latest statistics also show that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK reached a record 202,000 last year - an increase of 48,000 on the previous year.  Overall the number of EU nationals working in Britain was just over two million between October and December last year, compared with 1.8 million for the same period a year earlier.The number of people from the original EU states, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy, working in the UK also rose - by almost 92,000 from 761,000 to 853,000.The ONS said the statistics showed changes in the number of people in employment, not the proportion of new jobs that had been filled by UK and non-UK workers and should not be used as a proxy for flows of foreign migrants into the UK.Separate figures on migration are due to be released next week.  But on the eve of the EU summit where David Cameron is seeking a deal to restrict in-work benefits for EU migrants, the figures demonstrate the growing numbers of migrants from Eastern Europe who are coming to live and work in the UK. Last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney signalled that a rise in interest rates would not be imminent as global economic growth slowed. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the US economy added 151,000 jobs in January, helping to push the country's unemployment rate down to 4.9%.However, the US number was lower than expected and was a sharp slowdown from December, when 292,000 jobs were added.Unemployment in the eurozone dropped in December to its lowest rate in more than four years, despite worries about the global economy.Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency, said the jobless rate in the 19 country eurozone had fallen to 10.4% from 10.5% in November."

The fifth - on Kos - is not yet ready. On Tuesday Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos visited the new centres - called ""hotspots"" - on Leros and Chios. Two more are on Lesbos and Samos.Greece says the influx of migrants from Turkey has diminished in recent days.Converted shipping containers and prefab shelters are being used to house thousands of migrants on the Greek islands. The EU says they must all be registered there and fingerprinted before going anywhere else.Last year more than 850,000 migrants - mostly refugees fleeing war and abuses in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - entered Greece as a gateway to the EU. Greece has been heavily criticised by EU partners for failing to register many of the migrants before they travel north through the EU. Germany is the target destination for most of them.EU border staff are helping Greece now.Greece says its EU partners must share the burden of accommodating migrants. It refuses to become a sort of holding centre for the rest of Europe.Last week the EU set Greece a deadline of three months to fix its border controls, amid fears of another migration surge from Turkey when the weather improves. The crisis has put the EU's Schengen passport-free travel zone at risk. One after another, Schengen countries have imposed temporary border controls.European Council President Donald Tusk says expelling Greece from Schengen would in no way solve the EU's migrant crisis.The crisis will be high on the EU's agenda at a Brussels summit on Thursday.Schengen: EU free movement deal explainedMacedonia tries to stop migrant flowA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."

2016-02-18,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-18,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-18,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During last year's election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-18,"So near, so far",https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35600951,"Nothing is agreed, runs the diplomatic mantra, until everything is agreed. And so it will prove at this summit. A deal for the UK is within reach, but just one among a number of unresolved issues could delay everything. Only when the 28 national leaders sit down to negotiate face-to-face will the extent of potential problems become clear. Anything from proposed restrictions on child benefit payments to the meaning of the term ""ever closer union"" could provoke lengthy debate - lawyers will be on hand to go through the fine detail.""It seems rather absurd,"" said one senior EU diplomat, ""that prime ministers and presidents may have to spend hours debating the nature of restrictions on child benefit payments.""But we are where we are.""The UK will fight back against a demand from Eastern Europe that changes to child benefit rules in the UK should only apply to new applicants.Other countries are sensitive to the suggestion that changes to benefit payments, designed specifically with the UK in mind, could be adopted by other member states in the future. In Romania, for example, with about two million citizens living in Italy and Spain, that is a big concern. Part of the problem is that most countries didn't see a draft of this agreement until a couple of weeks ago. There is a huge amount to discuss, particularly because it involves so many complex legal issues.The UK demand for a cast-iron guarantee that the agreement negotiated by David Cameron will eventually be enshrined in the EU treaties is one of many challenging issues. Is it a red line? ""I would say it is essential,"" said an EU source. Financial regulation, the status of the City of London, and the language used to describe the relationship between countries inside and outside the eurozone, could also provoke a few late-night headaches.All in all, there is plenty that could still go wrong.But there's also a feeling that further delay won't make it any easier to reach a deal that everyone can live with. ""The intention of [the European Council President] Donald Tusk is very clear,"" one senior EU official said. ""He believes this week is the best time to reach a deal on a new settlement for the UK.""""There is a mood around town,"" said another source, ""that if we can't solve it now we're never going to solve it.""That is partly because the bar has been set relatively low. It is hard to describe the draft agreement that has emerged as a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with the rest of the European Union. Many of the demands David Cameron has raised in speeches and manifestos over the last few years have been watered down. But there is real change in there, perhaps more than many people thought he could achieve just a few months ago.And if, as appears most likely, a deal is done this week, the starting gun will soon be fired for a UK referendum campaign, which will define the political future of the prime minister and of his country."
2016-02-18,Risking it all,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35599680,"It gets cold, very very cold, waiting at the entrance of the European Council building in Brussels. You can spend several hours being jostled by French camera crews, squashed by Italian snappers, or shoved unceremoniously out of the way by any one of 27 other countries' journalists as the leaders of the European Union arrive one by one, and we frantically try to grab a word with them as they rush past. There'll be sharp elbows in the press pen, craning of necks and stretching of microphones, as David Cameron arrives at this summit, which could define not just his leadership, but the future of his party and his country's place in the world. But how on earth did the man who once accused the Conservatives of being out of touch for ""banging on about Europe"", get himself into a position where he has already been ""banging on about Europe"" for months and months, and will spend the next four months still doing precisely that? Since he made that claim in his first season as party leader in 2006, appearing in front of a huge video screen tastefully projected with a giant tree, there have been three big changes, linked, that have got him to this juncture, which of course ultimately is a product of his own political calculation.Most simply, as the years have passed, his party has changed. Since the Maastricht rebels failed to get a public vote in 1993 on the treaty that created the modern version of the European Union, there has been a rump of Conservatives deeply passionate about the cause, significantly concerned that the EU's laws, not Britain's own, are more important - the question of sovereignty that's a big part of the current talks. But their concerns, while shared by many Conservative Party members, were not considered mainstream in the parliamentary party - balanced, if not squeezed out, by heavyweight Europhile voices. But as the EU expanded, and generations of MPs came and went, a soft scepticism towards the European project, neither full-throated support, nor hardcore opposition, became more common, and sympathy for the idea of a referendum spread from the margins. The eurozone financial crisis, and the EU's stumbling approach to sorting it out, gave a fresh energy to eurosceptic MPs who wanted to campaign to leave.  In part that apathy, if not downright dislike, towards the EU spread because of the enormous rise in the numbers of people from around the Union who came to live and work in the UK. Numbers that took the political establishment completely by surprise began to arrive from the moment new countries like Poland joined the EU in 2004. There is a complicated, and emotional debate about the impact of the numbers, but few can dispute that the effect has been very significant in some parts of the country, with figures this week showing the numbers still rising, standing at more than two million now. For many people, that very visible impact of our membership of the EU has given them pause for thought.And it was that steep rise in EU immigration that gave David Cameron his most pressing political reason for - in the end - promising a referendum. UKIP's appeal grew alongside the rise in immigration. By 2012, they were greedily nibbling at the Conservative vote with a record performance in the local elections and a leader who in some moments seemed to appeal to swathes of the public for his plain speaking, in a style that also alienated many others. A drive to address the threat from UKIP and satisfy growing internal demands for the promise of a referendum led eventually to Mr Cameron's commitment in the 2013 speech to give the public a vote on whether to stay or go. It's worth remembering that, perhaps strangely, the 2013 speech in which he made his promise to hold a vote made no mention of immigration. But add a general election and increasing public concern to the mix and three years later, his hopes of limiting benefits for migrants are the centrepiece of his renegotiation. The prime minister is not a politician who is known for getting hung up on the past, his seemingly bomb-proof - if maybe sometimes misplaced - confidence in his own abilities tends to lead him to look forward. He is not a prisoner of his record. But as he arrives in Brussels on Thursday, and gets out of the shiny black limousine to sweep past the journalists clamouring to ask a question, will he consider even, for a moment, the irony that he may be risking it all for something he once more or less dismissed as a fringe concern?"
2016-02-18,Making headlines,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35590736,"As David Cameron continues his push to secure European leaders' backing for his EU reform demands, the media in several European countries look fearfully on the prospect of a possible Brexit.Several French papers focused on the UK PM's talks with French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday evening, in the final run-up to the European summit due to take place in Brussels at the end of this week.A headline in L'Express refers to the ""final marathon negotiations"". The paper says that despite official statements claiming that draft proposals for reforming Britain's EU membership provide a ""firm basis"" for a deal this week, the Cameron-Hollande talks had done little to tone down the differences between London and Paris.Le Monde also says ""major differences"" between London and Paris persist.A gloomy opinion piece in Le Monde by Guillaume Klossa, the founder of a pro-EU think-tank, is headlined ""Brexit: Neither a yes vote nor a no vote will save the EU from a major crisis"". Mr Klossa predicts that if British voters decide to leave the EU, other Eurosceptic countries within the bloc will be tempted to organise similar referendums, which will put at risk ""the very survival of the European project"" and could ""plunge Europe into the worst chaos in its history since the end of the second world war"".In Germany, the news website Focus also says Mr Cameron failed to achieve a breakthrough in his talks with Mr Hollande. Headlines in other German media focus on fears of the potential negative effect of a Brexit on trade and industry within the EU.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says that a ""majority of business owners fear Brexit"", while Der Spiegel notes that ""industry warns against Brexit"" In an article headlined ""Domino principle? Europe fears Brexit contagion"", the Hungarian paper Magyar Nemzet picks up on British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's recent remark that the UK's departure from the EU could trigger a wave of similar exits. The Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza takes a relatively sanguine view of the prospect of a Brexit. In an article headlined ""Will the world come to an end?"", the paper concludes: ""If Britons vote to end their relations with the EU, the sky will not fall down and the oceans will not flood our lands.

2016-02-18,Victory for vellum,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35569281,"After a reprieve, the UK is to continue printing and storing its laws on vellum, made from calf or goat-skin. But shouldn't these traditions give way to digital storage, asks Chris Stokel-Walker. Last week the House of Lords decided to end the printing of laws on vellum for cost reasons. But now the Cabinet Office is to provide the money from its own budget for the thousand-year-old tradition to continue.Vellum lasts a long time. Dig into the archives of the UK's parliament and pull out the oldest extant law and you'll find a very old document. It was first inscribed in 1497. Over time, ordinary paper can deteriorate rapidly, while vellum is said to retain its integrity for much longer. Original copies of the Magna Carta, signed more than 800 years ago on vellum, still exist.The proposed change was a move to higher-quality archival paper. But are politicians missing the point?Sharon McMeekin, of the Digital Preservation Coalition, an advocacy and advice group for digital recordkeeping, thinks so.""People have been bemoaning the loss of history by changing to archival paper,"" she explains. ""I think people are missing the point there. Truly representing the context and history in which these records were made require them to be kept in a digital format. It's more representative of the technologies and communication methods used today.""So why in the digital age do we keep physical records of documents at all?There's a simple answer, says Adrian Brown, the director of parliamentary archives, who oversees a collection including 8km-worth of physical records of parchment, paper and photographs in the 325ft tall Victoria Tower at the western edge of the Palace of Westminster. In the tower, scrolls of vellum are piled up in a vast repository, spooled in a range of different sizes, looking superficially much as they would have done hundreds of years ago.""We simply respond to the way parliament chooses to create its records,"" Brown says. ""In this case those are still going to be physical - though the proportion that is digital will increase over time.""But there are other reasons, too.""In many circles there's still a real discomfort around digital archiving, and a lack of belief that digital can survive into the future,"" explains Jenny Mitcham, digital archivist at the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York.The whole concept of digital storage is a relatively new innovation, and the path by which it could survive through the years is not clear. ""We don't have the ability to look back and say we know for a fact in 200 years time we'll still have this stuff,"" reasons Mitcham. ""We can't prove that fact without a time machine.""Vellum is made from calf-skin. The word shares its derivation with the word ""veal"" from the old French ""velin"" (Collins Dictionary) or ""veelin"" (Petit Robert).  Vellum is made by first soaking calf-skin in a lime wash, says calligrapher and illuminator Patricia Lovett. The lime causes the hair follicles to expand, making it easier to scrape fat and fur from the skin. This is done with a curved-bladed knife called a ""scudder"". The prepared skin is then washed and stretched onto a wooden frame, and scraped further with a lunar knife to raise the nap and create a more even thickness. Finally the skin is left to dry; the length of time depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and the individual qualities of the skin.   Patricia Lovett, calligrapherWatch vellum being made on BBC 4's Illuminations: The Private Lives of Medieval KingsThere's an excellent example of how a digital archive can quickly run into problems.Between 1984-86 the BBC Domesday Project engaged more than a million people from around Britain. Children at more than 9,000 schools helped compile a statistical survey, personal thoughts and memories. The data was stored on special laserdiscs, then seen as a technology of the future.Nearly two decades later, there were virtually no extant disc players able to read the specially formatted discs. After a lot of work, the data was made readable, but the case for digital archiving had suffered a setback. ""Examples like that imply that digital is more fragile than physical,"" Mitcham laments.Mike Tibbetts, one of the two creators of the Domesday Project, wrote in 2008 that ""the fault in all this lies not in the lack of vision or foresight by the technologists but that, at least in the UK, the national systems of data preservation and heritage archiving simply don't work reliably or consistently.""This is the issue, according to Jenny Mitcham. Just as preserving a physical archive requires careful consideration of temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure to prevent paper from turning brittle and breaking, so digital archives need to be tended to.""There's certainly truth in the fact that if [a] digital [format] is neglected, it'll become obsolete,"" she says. ""But if it's brought into a digital archive, and that digital archive is well set up and knows what it's doing, migrating and actively managing files over time, the chances those files will be readable in the future are vastly improved.""Adrian Brown lists the difficulties in maintaining paper records - ""decay, chemical changes that happen in the physical items; you've got insects and animal damage; the effects of temperature and light and humidity and dust. Tearing, rubbing, those kinds of issues.""But with digital, there are different risks. ""One of the things about digital information is that it's not fundamentally human-readable,"" he explains. ""You need some kind of technology to turn it into something understandable. Technology as we know changes very rapidly; what you can find is your way of turning those 1s and 0s into meaningful information can be threatened if you don't take precautions.""And, as anyone who has lost beloved holiday snaps to a hard drive failure knows, IT systems are far from infallible.""With digital, the last thing you want to do is put it somewhere and leave it alone,"" Mitcham says. ""There are things you need to do over time to make sure everything's OK with it."" Documents are migrated from one file format to another as old versions of applications become outdated. It's also necessary to check information hasn't been lost in the transition. Backup copies are continuously made, and placed in different locations. Checksums, a process to make sure errors have not wormed their way into files, are run weekly.So archives are indeed moving from pieces of paper to bits and bytes. The British Library keep a physical copy of every book, magazine and newspaper printed in the United Kingdom as part of the principle of ""legal deposit"", a law which has existed since 1662. But since 2013, electronic records of websites, blogs, CDs and electronic journals have also come under the catchment of the legal deposit law. Advocates point out digital records have their advantages over paper documents. Metadata associated with electronic files can give an insight into the messy creation of a work, rather than a polished final document. It's sometimes possible to view how long someone spent typing up a record, and even to see what they changed between drafts. And just as with 500-year-old vellum, there's history in our hard drives, too.""I get excited by digital archaeology,"" Mitcham admits. ""If you find a pile of 5¼ inch floppy disks, I get a buzz out of that. Being able to find out what's on those discs, look through old Wordstar files, and get an idea for how computing has moved on through time, that's fascinating.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox."
2016-02-18,Peculiar poll,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219021211/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35543194,"It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible. This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead. So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice. ""Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."" Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been ""beastly to him"" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was ""spoil him rotten"". Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons. His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice. The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit ""in a bespectacled eye"" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days. The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect. Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500. Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them. It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands.

2016-02-19,Cameron hopes of EU deal hit by delays,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35609968,"David Cameron's hopes of getting a reform deal on Friday look in doubt as haggling continues at the EU summit.European leaders have reportedly been told to book hotels as talks on a final text, planned for breakfast, slipped back first to lunch, and now to dinner.Several EU nations are digging their heels in over plans to curb migrant benefits and change EU regulations.The prime minster had planned to return to the UK to fire the starting gun on a EU referendum campaign on Friday.He sounded cautiously optimistic on Friday morning, saying there had been ""some progress"" in marathon all night talks, which broke up at 05:30 GMT.But stumbling blocks still remain after a day of one-to-one meetings and there is speculation talks will continue into Saturday.The  original aim had been to conclude the deal at an ""English breakfast"" meeting on Friday, which became an ""English brunch"", then an ""English lunch"" and has now been delayed to dinner.Mr Cameron's plan had been to head back to London, with a deal in his pocket, for an emergency cabinet meeting at which he would commit the government to campaign for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. That would trigger the start of the referendum campaign and allow ministers who want Britain to leave the EU to speak out.But Downing Street sources have told the BBC it was increasingly unlikely a cabinet meeting would now be held on Friday.They said it was still possible a deal could be done but they ""genuinely don't know"" whether it will happen.German Chancellor Angela Merkel was reported by the Reuters news agency as saying it had become ""clear that agreement will not be easy for many, but that the will is there"".Arriving at the summit venue on Friday morning, French President Francois Hollande made it clear that France continues to resist a deal on financial regulation aimed at protecting the City of London from new regulations imposed by the eurozone countries.""Since last night, there are proposals that have been changed, notably on what concerns France - the wish to have a financial regulation system which is valid in all parts of Europe, and that there should be no right of veto or prevention.""The first EU Council session ended on Thursday with no agreement on several issues, and an EU source said that while it had been ""intense and constructive"" with all the countries confirming their wish for the UK to stay in the bloc, some also set out specific concerns. The ongoing tussle in Brussels has been seized on at Westminster by both sides in this debate. Supporters of the prime minister say it underlines how fundamental the changes are the prime minister is seeking  - in terms of curbing migration, safeguards for the City and an opt out from further political integration. Opponents insist the difficulties show how resistant Brussels is to even modest reform. Former cabinet minister and leading Eurosceptic Owen Paterson dismissed the talks as a sideshow, a pantomime. Meanwhile, both campaigns are preparing for the possibility that a deal may not be done in time to hold a cabinet meeting later today - which may now have to be postponed until tomorrow. Once that is held, however, ministers will at last be free to campaign on both sides of the argument - with a number of ministers opposed to Britain's membership expected to speak out  over the weekend.Laura Kuenssberg: Tory activists hail EU deal... before it's done""We expected this,"" the EU source said: ""But honestly we had hoped for some of them to be less critical.""An EU source spoke of five key areas where agreement had not been reached:It is understood Mr Cameron continues to face resistance to his plans to curb in-work benefits for EU migrants.But he is thought to have rejected calls from the Central European nations, represented in the overnight talks by Czech prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka, for cuts in child benefit for offspring living overseas to be imposed only on new migrants.Belgium - backed by France - proposed that the summit conclusions should state that any deal agreed this week is final and the EU will not come back with an improved offer if Britain votes to leave.The move is designed to kill off the idea, backed by some Eurosceptics that a Leave vote would give the UK leverage to extract further concessions from the EU before a second poll.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he expected Mr Cameron to come back with a deal from Brussels, as the other leaders would recognise how ""embarrassing"" it would be for him to return empty-handed.But he added: ""He hasn't asked for us to get back supremacy for our Parliament, he hasn't asked for us to control our own borders, he hasn't asked to reduce the vast daily fees we pay. ""We will be allowed - after he has come here like Oliver Twist and begged for concessions - to control migrant benefits for up to four years. I find the whole thing as a British person pretty shameful.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would be campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU - but he branded David Cameron's renegotiations ""a theatrical sideshow, designed to appease his opponents within the Conservative Party"".Friday:15:00 GMT: Main meeting on UK's reforms, following overnight talks and one-to-one sessions between Mr Cameron and other EU leadersIf David Cameron gets a deal, he will return to the UK as quickly as possible to hold an emergency cabinet meeting to reach an agreed position on remaining in the EU.  At this point, ministers who want Britain out of the EU will be allowed to speak out.Mr Cameron may then announce the date of the UK's referendum, although he does not have to do so17 March: The next scheduled EU summit - at which Mr Cameron could have another chance to get a deal.

No further devolution. Holyrood can't take on extra tax and welfare powers unless there's a fiscal framework to underpin them.Any framework will include a system to reduce the grant Holyrood gets from the Treasury, to reflect its growing ability to raise its own revenue.The two sides are struggling to agree the fairest way to achieve that. The Scottish government says the Treasury's current offer would leave it out of pocket. The Treasury disputes that and says SNP ministers can't expect taxpayers in the rest of the UK to underwrite all the risks that come with extra responsibilities. The Scotland Office minister, Lord Dunlop, says the UK government is ""committed to go the extra mile to get a deal"". But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she ""will not sign up to a deal that's unfair to Scotland"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter.He has said that ""no one is keener"" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to ""move towards"" his position.Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month.On Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson proposed a compromise that would see both sides give some ground to agree a shorter-term deal that would be reviewed in five years.Earlier this week, Mr Hands was criticised for being on holiday with his family while negotiations were taking place.A Treasury spokeswoman has said the UK government had shown it was willing to compromise and ""go the extra mile"" to secure an agreement.The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the ""no detriment"" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland.This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement. The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an ""almost £3bn cut"", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is ""not logical"" and ""not fair"" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK.The deal proposed by Ms Davidson would see both parties give some ground.She wants the Scottish government to agree to the UK government's new method of calculating the amount of money it receives each year from the Treasury.In return, she wants the UK government to guarantee the devolved administration would not receive ""a penny less"" than it would under its preferred mechanism, effectively insuring Holyrood against any budget shortfall.This deal would then be reviewed in full after a five-year trial period."
2016-02-19,Lib Dem defeat blamed on 'perfect storm',https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35615285,"The Liberal Democrats' general election defeat was the result of a ""perfect storm"" including the tuition fees U-turn, a loss of activists, a weak Labour Party and an effective Tory strategy, a party review has concluded.The Lib Dems went from 57 MPs in 2010 to eight in May, triggering the resignation of leader Nick Clegg.The party's election review said its move into coalition with the Tories had not been ""well understood"".It also blamed a ""confusing"" campaign.After the Lib Dems joined the Tory-led coalition in 2010, Mr Clegg was made deputy prime minister, with several high-profile ministerial roles taken by Lib Dems.The review said Lib Dem members agreed the party was right to join the coalition ""in the national interest"" but said it had ""singularly failed at using our new position to garner support, retain and communicate our vision, or maintain a unique offer"".Ditching the party's key pledge to scrap tuition fees ""significantly damaged"" the Lib Dems' reputation and credibility, the review concluded, saying it was ""almost incomprehensible"" that 27 MPs voted in favour of an increase despite the ""carefully-negotiated"" coalition agreement allowing them to abstain.Other factors blamed for the loss of support were a lack of financial resources and campaigns with differing messages in different parts of the country as well as ""ageing members and deflated morale"" among activists.""For some MPs, local leadership took a back seat to the demands of Westminster,"" it added.When it came to the general election, the review said no party had a response to the Tories' message warning of a Labour alliance with the SNP, and criticised the Lib Dems' ""fast-changing, complicated messages"".The review -  carried out by members of the party's Campaigns and Communications Committee - made a string of recommendations to help the party fare better in any future coalition.These include that Lib Dems should make it clear they will only automatically vote for legislation covered by the coalition agreement, and that the ""wider party"" should be represented in the negotiations.Tim Farron, who replaced Mr Clegg as leader, said: ""Blame and criticism can provide short term satisfaction, but do nothing for a future vision.""This report is about setting a way forward, recognising the mistakes we made, and learning from them."""

Drink removes their inhibitions and pushes them over the edge.""Mr Hurd dismissed the idea of having a ""rural riot squad"" to react to spontaneous disorder, saying: ""They would spend their time chasing from one end of the county to another.""Instead he proposed tougher licensing laws, quick prosecutions and exemplary sentences, and improved policing procedures.The newly-released documents also show that Margaret Thatcher's advisers urged the prime minister to force a showdown with her Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, telling him to accept her authority or quit, over the Westland affair in 1986.Mr Heseltine was backing a European consortium in its battle with the US aircraft manufacturer Sikorsky to take over British aircraft manufacturer Westland, even though the government was supposed to be neutral.Other documents show Mrs Thatcher refused to bail out the 1986 Commonwealth Games despite being asked to contribute £1m by media tycoon Robert Maxwell.And Mrs Thatcher was warned repeatedly that the Poll Tax would be a political disaster, the files revealed.Widespread protests against the new tax in 1989 were seen as one of the reasons why Mrs Thatcher was forced out of Number 10 the following year."

""These numbers make it clear why we need to act now before obesity becomes an even greater problem.""And Jane Landon, from the UK Health Forum, argued: ""Countries which have introduced a tax on sugary drinks have not only reduced consumption, they have raised much-needed revenues for public health measures.""The report has come out as the government is preparing its obesity strategy, which is due in the next few weeks.Prime Minister David Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have indicated all options are on the table, including a sugar tax.A report by Public Health England said a sugary drinks tax would cut sugar consumption ""at least in the short term"".And TV chef Jamie Oliver has campaigned for the tax saying it was the ""single most important"" change that could be made.The director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, said: ""The hypothetical claims made in this modelling study run contrary to real-world evidence. ""In fact, the soft drinks tax in Mexico has reduced average calorie intake by six calories per person per day, with no evidence that it has reduced levels of obesity.""He added that other options such as reducing portion sizes or changing ingredients would be more effective.Follow James on Twitter.Why is sugar so addictive?Michael Mosley on how much sugar is in foodCan we trust industry?"

It currently holds 30 of the assembly's 60 seats.""This year's conference and the upcoming election represents the half-way point in our decade of delivery,"" Mr Jones, first minister since 2009, said. ""We achieved all the promises we set out in 2011 despite huge cuts from the Tories and now we must win again to build on our record.""Wales is on the up. Exam results, employment figures, cancer survival rates - all going up.""Labour's campaign pledges for 2016 include 100,000 new apprentices and a fund to pay for new drugs on the NHS.Mr Jones added: ""There is a new momentum in Wales - in the performance of our schools, in the numbers of new jobs and in the performance of our NHS. ""Now it is time to build on the strong foundations we have laid - not risk it all with a ragbag coalition of other parties combining economic illiteracy and huge cuts to services.""The past 12 months have been amongst the most tumultuous in Labour's history. After crashing to an unexpected defeat in the general election, the party swung sharply to the left with the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader and the party at Westminster remains riven over both issues and strategy.Welsh Labour will be hoping to insulate themselves from the party's wider travails in May's assembly elections by concentrating on the track record of Carwyn Jones' government and the key pledges to be implemented should Labour be returned for a fifth successive term in Cardiff Bay.Even if the Welsh party succeeds in putting some distance between itself and the UK party, it faces strong challenges over its handling of Welsh public services, in particular the NHS. The party's patchy record, combined with a mood for change after 17 years of Labour rule in Cardiff Bay, leaves Labour vulnerable and, privately, party sources are resigned to losing ground in May.The quirks of the assembly electoral system and a divided opposition should see Labour again emerge as easily the largest party in Cardiff Bay.However, a successful conference would help calm the jitters of activists as the party navigates some very choppy waters.

Kent Police officers will liaise closely with the Electoral Commission and investigate if appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said.The commission said it would specifically consider whether stays at the Royal Harbour Hotel in Ramsgate and the Premier Inn in Margate, should have been included in national campaign spending or not. ""The investigation opened by the commission today focuses on whether the Conservative Party met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act,"" a statement said.The commission's sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000.The allegations were first made by on 20 January and relate to how much an individual can spend on their campaign during an election.The commission said that during what was defined as the ""short campaign"" - which ran from 30 March to 7 May - £8,700 could be spent, plus 6p for every ""registered parliamentary elector"".In his blog Michael Crick - the political correspondent for Channel 4 - said the legal expense limit in Thanet South for that period was £15,016."
2016-02-19,Troops to Teachers sees 28 qualify,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35595424," A flagship scheme to bring ex-servicemen and women to England's classrooms has seen 28 veterans qualify as teachers since it started.Former Education Secretary Michael Gove had hoped to attract 2,000 applicants to the £4.3m Troops to Teachers scheme.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said the low numbers showed the government had failed to get a grip on the teacher shortage crisis.The government said the scheme's impact was positive and set to grow.It stressed the figures, revealed in a written answer to a parliamentary question, referred to the first round of trainees to graduate from the scheme.In another answer, schools minister Nick Gibb said a total of 551 applications had been received for the scheme, which began training people in 2014.This led to 41 individuals starting the programme in its first year. Since then 28 of the 29 who completed the programme had achieved qualified teacher status (QTS), he said.Ms Powell said: ""I very much want to see more veterans re-training to become teachers as they have a huge amount to offer and we desperately need more good teachers.  ""What's clear is that, as with the government's general slow response to teacher shortages, this scheme isn't working because the government isn't focusing on teacher recruitment.  ""We urgently need a proper strategy for teacher recruitment, including of veterans for whom this could make a great second career.""It was back in 2008 that the then shadow education secretary Michael Gove, backed a UK version of an American programme to get ex-servicemen teaching in England's schools.Within months of taking office, he announced plans for the Troops to Teachers programme.But the simplicity of the idea, giving soldiers leaving Afghanistan and Iraq future careers and getting a bit of military discipline in classrooms, has been belied by its delivery.Challenges lay in working across two government departments - education and defence.The programme is part of the DfE's commitment to the cross-government Military Covenant, which aims to help support service leavers get back into civilian life.Many applicants did not have the pre-requisite qualifications or could not stay the rather demanding course of becoming a teacher - despite their Army heroics.And as teaching unions have warned, there is no direct correlation between a good service record and being good teacher material.But ministers are convinced the scheme is good and that it can still be a success.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""The 28 graduates referred to are the first trainees to be recruited and completed their two-year course at the end of December. ""A further two cohorts are being trained right now which means that more than 140 former troops are working in our classrooms and record numbers of eligible applicants have applied for the latest cohort.""These figures relate to recruitment for 2016.The spokesman added: ""The impact of these recruits in the classroom has been overwhelmingly positive with head teachers praising the influence they've had on pupils' attainment.""It is not the first time the low take-up of the scheme has been in the news. In July 2014, the BBC News website reported the scheme had sent a total of 41 trainees to England's classrooms in its first year.The revelation comes just a week after a National Audit Office report highlighted how the government had missed its teacher recruitment targets for four years in a row.The Troops to Teachers scheme, run by the University of Brighton, is based on the idea that military values such as leadership, discipline, motivation and teamwork are particularly useful for teaching. First mooted in 2008, it provides non-graduate recruits with on-the-job training four days a week, with one day reserved for academic study.Trainees go straight into the school-based programme after a minimum of one week's work experience in a school. They start to teach after spending two terms observing.After two years, trainees count as ""newly qualified teachers"" and gain an honours degrees in education, specialising either as secondary school subject teachers or as primary school teachers. Some teaching unions criticised the entry requirements for the scheme and questioned the notion that a good service record meant a candidate would make a good teacher."

""How are such basic, avoidable mistakes still happening? There is clearly a lack of learning in the NHS.""It is especially unforgivable to operate on the wrong organ, and many such mistakes can never be rectified.""NHS England insisted never events were rare - affecting one in every 20,000 procedures - and that the majority of the 4.6 million hospital operations each year were safe.A spokeswoman said: ""One never event is too many and we mustn't underestimate the effect on the patients concerned. ""To better understand the reasons why, in 2013 we commissioned a taskforce to investigate, leading to a new set of national standards being published last year specifically to support doctors, nurses and hospitals to prevent these mistakes.""Any organisation that reports a serious incident is also expected to conduct its own investigation so it can learn and take action to prevent similar incidents from being repeated."""
2016-02-19,Tory bullying claims 'must be explored',https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-35604553,"A young Conservative activist's parents are calling on an inquest into his death to look at bullying in the party.Elliott Johnson, who was found dead on railway tracks in Bedfordshire, is thought to have killed himself.Weeks earlier he had raised allegations about the way he was being treated in the Conservatives' youth wing.A full inquest into the 21-year-old's death was due to take place next month but this has been delayed to hear arguments from lawyers for his family. Instead a review hearing will allow the Johnson family's lawyers to argue that further evidence about the culture in the Conservative Party at the time should be heard.Mr Johnson's father Ray, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: ""We want to ensure that the inquest covers all aspects surrounding Elliott's death.""The original intention had been to hold a relatively short one-and-a-half-hour inquest only hearing evidence from the police.""We've said there's more to this than simply what the police have reported and the coroner has agreed to hear our representations.""This will include additional evidence taking the whole episode back several weeks and months to reveal the full circumstances surrounding Elliott's state of mind.""The family have already decided they will not participate in an internal review by the Conservative Party, saying they do not want to lend credibility to a process they fear will be a whitewash.Elliott Johnson had alleged bullying a month before his death in September, sparking an investigation and the resignation of then party chairman Grant Shapps.The allegations centre on the activities of former activist Mark Clarke, who has since been expelled from the party. Mr Clarke has denied the allegations against him.Ray Johnson says his son's concerns were brought to the party's attention on 12 August. Elliott was found dead on railway tracks near Sandy station on 15 September."
2016-02-19,"UK unemployment drops by 60,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35594650,"Unemployment in the UK fell by 60,000 between October and December to 1.69 million, according to the Office for National Statistics.The rate of unemployment was unchanged from a month ago at 5.1%, maintaining a decade-low rate.More than 31.4 million people are in work, the highest figure since records began in 1971.But ONS statistician Nick Palmer said that growth in people's earnings was still slow.""While the employment rate continues to hit new highs and there are more job vacancies than ever previously recorded, earnings growth remains subdued and markedly below the recent peak of mid-2015,"" Mr Palmer said.Pay increased by 2.0% during the period, very similar to the growth rate between September to November 2014 and September to November 2015, which was 1.9%.The number of Britons in work increased by 278,000 in the three months to the end of December, to 28.28 million, while for non-UK nationals, the figure rose by 254,000 to 3.22 million.The economically inactive rate for women fell to 27.2%, a record low.Wales, the North East and the North West of England recorded the largest drops in the rate of unemployment, all falling more than half a percentage point.The North East of England still has the highest rate of unemployment, at 8.1%, and the South West of England the lowest, at 3.7%.There were 5.35 million people employed in the public sector in September 2015, according to ONS, down 59,000 on a year earlier. It is the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1999, the ONS says.By Carole Walker, BBC political correspondent These latest statistics also show that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK reached a record 202,000 last year - an increase of 48,000 on the previous year.  Overall the number of EU nationals working in Britain was just over two million between October and December last year, compared with 1.8 million for the same period a year earlier.The number of people from the original EU states, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy, working in the UK also rose - by almost 92,000 from 761,000 to 853,000.The ONS said the statistics showed changes in the number of people in employment, not the proportion of new jobs that had been filled by UK and non-UK workers and should not be used as a proxy for flows of foreign migrants into the UK.Separate figures on migration are due to be released next week.  But on the eve of the EU summit where David Cameron is seeking a deal to restrict in-work benefits for EU migrants, the figures demonstrate the growing numbers of migrants from Eastern Europe who are coming to live and work in the UK. Last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney signalled that a rise in interest rates would not be imminent as global economic growth slowed. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the US economy added 151,000 jobs in January, helping to push the country's unemployment rate down to 4.9%.However, the US number was lower than expected and was a sharp slowdown from December, when 292,000 jobs were added.Unemployment in the eurozone dropped in December to its lowest rate in more than four years, despite worries about the global economy.Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency, said the jobless rate in the 19 country eurozone had fallen to 10.4% from 10.5% in November."

2016-02-19,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-19,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation.

It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-19,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-19,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union by the end of 2017. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people - including, it is said, the prime minister himself - think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out and June or September 2016 are now seen as most likely. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events.When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During last year's election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. The SNP also opposed a referendum. The UK Independence Party and the Greens both backed a referendum. As already mentioned, the Conservatives won the election and the necessary legislation has gone through Parliament so parties' focus is not on whether to hold a referendum, but which side to back.The question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron set out the four key ways he wants to change the UK's membership of the EU in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk in November:European Council President Donald Tusk has put together a draft deal ahead of the February EU summit where the UK's renegotiation demands are set to be debated.Mr Cameron got some of his demands but had to compromise on others.Security: The PM has got some unexpected gains, making it easier for countries to stop terror suspects coming into the country even if the threat they pose is not imminent. There will also be a crackdown to stop people using sham marriages and other loopholes to gain access to the EU.  Read more: What PM wanted v what he gotNo - other countries will still have their say, and more negotiations are planned ahead of the summit where they are due to be discussed on 18-19 February.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders, saying instead that he ""rules nothing out"". The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"" if he gets what he wants from his renegotiation with the other member states, and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-19,Summit to eat?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35615291,"It has been billed as the crunch summit where David Cameron battles to secure agreement for his EU reforms.But as the talks have dragged on, a sub-plot has kept waiting press entertained, with a succession of ""English"" meals dangled before the 28 leaders - only to be whisked away as negotiations extend longer than planned. First up:This was how aides to European Council president Donald Tusk billed what were to be Friday morning's triumphant talks sealing the deal. Had it been called an ""all-day breakfast"" they would have been covered. But the 8am fry-up was touted as the key to reaching a deal if there was no agreement on Thursday night.With ""no real progress"" made, it was pushed back to 11am, giving it more of an air of a brunch. As it happened though, the bilateral talks carried on.As announced by European Council president Donald Tusk's spokesman, it was then put back to 14:00, before going the way of the breakfast and the brunch.Or, as an EU spokesman put it, ""late English lunch"". With Europe's leaders still at loggerheads, tired and surely starving, would a plate of sandwiches and scones help bridge the gap? It was meant to take place at 15:30 Brussels time, 7.5 hours after the promised breakfast.But the scones never materialised.No sign of a deal, and no sign of that meal, as the breakfast/brunch/lunch morphed into an ""English dinner"" - with the time to be confirmed:The ""English"" tag attached to each meal did not go unnoticed, as some wondered why other parts of the UK were not contributing.Speculation raged as to what the dinner could consist of:We might find out, with an EU source suggesting a ""good chance"" of a deal over dinner. But German chancellor Angela Merkel was taking no chances as she popped out for a bag of chips.She might need the extra sustenance, as leaders have been told to book a hotel room for an extra night - so they could be contemplating that English breakfast all over again."
2016-02-19,Counting chickens?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35615548,"While Downing Street insists they ""genuinely don't know"" if the prime minister will be able to get a deal at today's vital summit, a group of Conservatives, under the auspices of Conservatives for Reform in Europe have already circulated a letter applauding his achievement.Sixty activists from the group, which is led by the senior MP Nick Herbert, have signed a letter praising Cameron - ""for the first time since 1975 a British Prime Minister has returned from a summit with more powers than when they arrived"". That's despite the fact the group claims officially they will support Mr Cameron on condition that the renegotiation is successful.The letter says ""we fully support the deal the PM has negotiated which helps the UK secure a unique status in a reformed Europe"" and suggests that the group has made its decision to back him already before the deal is done.CRE was founded by 36 MPs and was set up to help garner support for the prime minister among Tory backbenchers. A spokeswoman for the campaign said that ""activists were keen to support the prime minister and are waiting for the deal like everyone else"".Here is the full text of the letter: Dear Sir,As Conservative activists who deliver leaflets, knock on doors, fundraise, hold office in the Party and represent our party in public elections, we fully support the deal the Prime Minister has negotiated which helps the UK secure a unique status in a reformed Europe. We appreciate that very few British people approve of everything the EU does and that there is clearly a need for further and continuing reform. However, no one knows what BREXIT would look like and few would wish to risk our economic and national security without being certain of the alternative. We would be safer in a reformed Europe, for example, because we cooperate with our European neighbours on terrorism and crime.Many Eurosceptics shout the loudest and are determined to disparage whatever deal the Prime Minister achieves. We take a more pragmatic approach. For the first time since 1975, a British Prime Minister has returned from a summit with more powers than when they arrived. In a reformed Europe, the UK would get the best of both worlds.Yours faithfully,(Names of 60 members and their constituencies)"
2016-02-19,"So near, so far",https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35600951,"Nothing is agreed, runs the diplomatic mantra, until everything is agreed. And so it will prove at this summit. A deal for the UK is within reach, but just one among a number of unresolved issues could delay everything. Only when the 28 national leaders sit down to negotiate face-to-face will the extent of potential problems become clear. Anything from proposed restrictions on child benefit payments to the meaning of the term ""ever closer union"" could provoke lengthy debate - lawyers will be on hand to go through the fine detail.""It seems rather absurd,"" said one senior EU diplomat, ""that prime ministers and presidents may have to spend hours debating the nature of restrictions on child benefit payments.""But we are where we are.""The UK will fight back against a demand from Eastern Europe that changes to child benefit rules in the UK should only apply to new applicants.Other countries are sensitive to the suggestion that changes to benefit payments, designed specifically with the UK in mind, could be adopted by other member states in the future. In Romania, for example, with about two million citizens living in Italy and Spain, that is a big concern. Part of the problem is that most countries didn't see a draft of this agreement until a couple of weeks ago. There is a huge amount to discuss, particularly because it involves so many complex legal issues.The UK demand for a cast-iron guarantee that the agreement negotiated by David Cameron will eventually be enshrined in the EU treaties is one of many challenging issues. Is it a red line? ""I would say it is essential,"" said an EU source. Financial regulation, the status of the City of London, and the language used to describe the relationship between countries inside and outside the eurozone, could also provoke a few late-night headaches.All in all, there is plenty that could still go wrong.But there's also a feeling that further delay won't make it any easier to reach a deal that everyone can live with. ""The intention of [the European Council President] Donald Tusk is very clear,"" one senior EU official said. ""He believes this week is the best time to reach a deal on a new settlement for the UK.""""There is a mood around town,"" said another source, ""that if we can't solve it now we're never going to solve it.""That is partly because the bar has been set relatively low. It is hard to describe the draft agreement that has emerged as a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with the rest of the European Union. Many of the demands David Cameron has raised in speeches and manifestos over the last few years have been watered down. But there is real change in there, perhaps more than many people thought he could achieve just a few months ago.And if, as appears most likely, a deal is done this week, the starting gun will soon be fired for a UK referendum campaign, which will define the political future of the prime minister and of his country."

There'll be sharp elbows in the press pen, craning of necks and stretching of microphones, as David Cameron arrives at this summit, which could define not just his leadership, but the future of his party and his country's place in the world. But how on earth did the man who once accused the Conservatives of being out of touch for ""banging on about Europe"", get himself into a position where he has already been ""banging on about Europe"" for months and months, and will spend the next four months still doing precisely that? Since he made that claim in his first season as party leader in 2006, appearing in front of a huge video screen tastefully projected with a giant tree, there have been three big changes, linked, that have got him to this juncture, which of course ultimately is a product of his own political calculation.Most simply, as the years have passed, his party has changed. Since the Maastricht rebels failed to get a public vote in 1993 on the treaty that created the modern version of the European Union, there has been a rump of Conservatives deeply passionate about the cause, significantly concerned that the EU's laws, not Britain's own, are more important - the question of sovereignty that's a big part of the current talks. But their concerns, while shared by many Conservative Party members, were not considered mainstream in the parliamentary party - balanced, if not squeezed out, by heavyweight Europhile voices. But as the EU expanded, and generations of MPs came and went, a soft scepticism towards the European project, neither full-throated support, nor hardcore opposition, became more common, and sympathy for the idea of a referendum spread from the margins. The eurozone financial crisis, and the EU's stumbling approach to sorting it out, gave a fresh energy to eurosceptic MPs who wanted to campaign to leave.  In part that apathy, if not downright dislike, towards the EU spread because of the enormous rise in the numbers of people from around the Union who came to live and work in the UK. Numbers that took the political establishment completely by surprise began to arrive from the moment new countries like Poland joined the EU in 2004. There is a complicated, and emotional debate about the impact of the numbers, but few can dispute that the effect has been very significant in some parts of the country, with figures this week showing the numbers still rising, standing at more than two million now. For many people, that very visible impact of our membership of the EU has given them pause for thought.And it was that steep rise in EU immigration that gave David Cameron his most pressing political reason for - in the end - promising a referendum. UKIP's appeal grew alongside the rise in immigration. By 2012, they were greedily nibbling at the Conservative vote with a record performance in the local elections and a leader who in some moments seemed to appeal to swathes of the public for his plain speaking, in a style that also alienated many others. A drive to address the threat from UKIP and satisfy growing internal demands for the promise of a referendum led eventually to Mr Cameron's commitment in the 2013 speech to give the public a vote on whether to stay or go. It's worth remembering that, perhaps strangely, the 2013 speech in which he made his promise to hold a vote made no mention of immigration. But add a general election and increasing public concern to the mix and three years later, his hopes of limiting benefits for migrants are the centrepiece of his renegotiation. The prime minister is not a politician who is known for getting hung up on the past, his seemingly bomb-proof - if maybe sometimes misplaced - confidence in his own abilities tends to lead him to look forward. He is not a prisoner of his record. But as he arrives in Brussels on Thursday, and gets out of the shiny black limousine to sweep past the journalists clamouring to ask a question, will he consider even, for a moment, the irony that he may be risking it all for something he once more or less dismissed as a fringe concern?"
2016-02-19,Making headlines,https://web.archive.org//web/20160219193643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35590736,"As David Cameron continues his push to secure European leaders' backing for his EU reform demands, the media in several European countries look fearfully on the prospect of a possible Brexit.Several French papers focused on the UK PM's talks with French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday evening, in the final run-up to the European summit due to take place in Brussels at the end of this week.A headline in L'Express refers to the ""final marathon negotiations"". The paper says that despite official statements claiming that draft proposals for reforming Britain's EU membership provide a ""firm basis"" for a deal this week, the Cameron-Hollande talks had done little to tone down the differences between London and Paris.Le Monde also says ""major differences"" between London and Paris persist.A gloomy opinion piece in Le Monde by Guillaume Klossa, the founder of a pro-EU think-tank, is headlined ""Brexit: Neither a yes vote nor a no vote will save the EU from a major crisis"". Mr Klossa predicts that if British voters decide to leave the EU, other Eurosceptic countries within the bloc will be tempted to organise similar referendums, which will put at risk ""the very survival of the European project"" and could ""plunge Europe into the worst chaos in its history since the end of the second world war"".In Germany, the news website Focus also says Mr Cameron failed to achieve a breakthrough in his talks with Mr Hollande. Headlines in other German media focus on fears of the potential negative effect of a Brexit on trade and industry within the EU.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says that a ""majority of business owners fear Brexit"", while Der Spiegel notes that ""industry warns against Brexit"" In an article headlined ""Domino principle? Europe fears Brexit contagion"", the Hungarian paper Magyar Nemzet picks up on British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's recent remark that the UK's departure from the EU could trigger a wave of similar exits. The Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza takes a relatively sanguine view of the prospect of a Brexit. In an article headlined ""Will the world come to an end?"", the paper concludes: ""If Britons vote to end their relations with the EU, the sky will not fall down and the oceans will not flood our lands. Well, at least we hope that the world will not end."" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2016-02-20,Cameron calls EU referendum for June,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35621079,"The UK will vote on whether to remain in the EU on Thursday 23 June, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.The prime minister made his historic announcement in Downing Street after briefing the cabinet.He said he would be campaigning to remain in a reformed EU - and described the vote as one of the biggest decisions ""in our lifetimes"".Ministers immediately divided up into the leave and remain camps as the campaigns got under way in earnest.The referendum date announcement comes after renegotiations on the UK's relationship with Europe were finalised on Friday night after intense wrangling at a two-day summit in Brussels.The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, include changes to migrant welfare payments, safeguards for Britain's financial services and making it easier to block unwanted EU regulations.Some Conservative MPs have announced their intention to back the prime minister. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. But many Conservatives have announced they will back the leave campaign including Mr Cameron's long-time ally, Justice Secretary Michael Gove.London Mayor Boris Johnson, who has previously been a Eurosceptic, has yet to declare where he stands.On Sunday, he is expected to confirm he will campaign for out, but has told friends he is genuinely conflicted, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says.Number 10 is resigned to him opposing them following a meeting this week, at which he was disappointed with Mr Cameron's plans, our editor adds.Mr Johnson has also discussed his decision with Mr Gove.According to the latest opinion polls, the British public are thought to be fairly evenly split. Despite the polite promises of civilised debate, Mr Cameron is risking the unity of his party with the referendum. Cabinet ministers like Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove, finally allowed to speak out today, rushed straight from Downing Street to work the phones for one of the leave campaigns. The gang of six who posed awkwardly for photographs could well become seven when Boris Johnson breaks his continuing silence. But whatever the individual calculations, expressions of opinion on either side are dwarfed by what today's announcement finally confirms - that in 123 days British voters have the chance to choose to step away from one of the institutions that has shaped our laws, and all of our lives, for more than 40 years. Read more from LauraIn his statement, Mr Cameron warned that leaving the EU would be a ""leap in the dark"" as he urged voters to back his reform deal.""The choice is in your hands - but my recommendation is clear. I believe that Britain will be safer, stronger and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union.""Home Secretary Theresa May said the EU was far from perfect but ""for reasons of security, protection against crime and terrorism, trade with Europe, and access to markets around the world"" it was in the national interest to remain in.Read moreMr Gove said it had been the most difficult decision of his career to go against the prime minister, but he believed ""our country would be freer, fairer and better off outside the EU"". He added: ""Far from providing security in an uncertain world, the EU's policies have become a source of instability and insecurity.""Commons leader Chris Grayling, another leave campaign backer, said: ""I actually believe the EU is holding this country back. We cannot control our borders, limit the number of people who come here do trade deals.""I do not believe we can take decisions in the national interest when we are part of the European Union.""He said the prime minister had ""put in a Herculean effort to try to deliver change"" to Britain's relationship with the EU, but the ""concessions"" he had brought back from Brussels did not ""give us the opportunity to take decisions in the national interest"" without consulting Brussels.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Employment Minster Priti Patel, who is not a full cabinet member but attends meetings, have also joined the leave campaign.Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom - who is not a member of the cabinet - will also back the leave campaign.The rest of the cabinet joined Mr Cameron in the remain camp, including Business Secretary Sajid Javid - previously seen as a potential leave supporter.The UK held a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU. The vote was in favour of staying in, but there have been growing calls from the public and politicians for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years.The organisation has extended its control and now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport and consumer rights.David Cameron initially resisted calls for another vote, but in 2013 he changed his mind. At the last election he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of a public vote to decide whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU.Mr Cameron claims his EU reform deal will give Britain ""special status"" within the bloc - tackling concerns over migrants getting ""something for nothing"" from the benefit system and exempting the country from the EU drive for ""ever-closer union"".But critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration or take back powers from Brussels.UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: ""The 23rd is our golden opportunity, let battle be joined. Mr Cameron keeps on telling us that Britain would be better in a 'reformed Europe'. But he fails to point out that there is no reformed European Union on offer here. The prime minister's EU deal is pathetic."" Britain Stronger in Europe released a campaign video accusing leave campaigners of ""utter hypocrisy"" for attacking Mr Cameron's deal, claiming that many of them have been calling for the same reforms.The key points of Mr Cameron's reform deal are: The Labour Party is officially campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, although a small group of the party's backbenchers have joined the leave campaign.Leader Jeremy Corbyn voted for Britain to leave the European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, in 1975 but has since changed his mind, arguing that ""it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers"".He branded Mr Cameron's negotiations a ""sideshow"" aimed at appeasing critics in the Conservative Party and said he had missed an opportunity to protect jobs and ""stop the spread of low pay"".Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a statement the SNP will be ""leading the positive case to keep Scotland in the EU"".

And if, at this moment of decision, I didn't say what I believe, I would not be true to my convictions or my country.""By leaving the EU we can take control. Indeed, we can show the rest of Europe the way to flourish.""Instead of grumbling and complaining about the things we can't change and growing resentful and bitter, we can shape an optimistic, forward-looking and genuinely internationalist alternative to the path the EU is going down.""He said he had wrestled for weeks ""with the most difficult decision of my political life"".""I was encouraged to stand for Parliament by David Cameron and he has given me the opportunity to serve in what I believe is a great, reforming government.""I think he is an outstanding prime minister. There is, as far as I can see, only one significant issue on which we have differed. And that is the future of the UK in the European Union.""It pains me to have to disagree with the prime minister on any issue. My instinct is to support him through good times and bad.""But I cannot duck the choice which the prime minister has given every one of us.""Mr Gove said it was ""hard to overstate the degree to which the EU is a constraint on ministers' ability to do the things they were elected to do, or to use their judgment about the right course of action for the people of this country"". Addressing claims by Mrs May and the prime minister that remaining in the EU was the best option for Britain's future security, he said: ""Far from providing security in an uncertain world, the EU's policies have become a source of instability and insecurity.""Mr Cameron has warned that leaving the European Union would be a ""leap in the dark"", as he urged voters to back his reform deal.The PM said: ""Those who want to leave Europe cannot tell you if British businesses would be able to access Europe's free trade single market, or if working people's jobs are safe, or how much prices would rise. All they're offering is a risk at a time of uncertainty - a leap in the dark.""Mr Gove's decision was welcomed by out campaigners, with UKIP MEP Roger Helmer tweeting: ""Seems that Michael Gove will campaign for #Brexit. Well done that man. Courageous and principled.""There has been increasing speculation in recent days that Mr Gove would argue for an EU exit, with some commentators suggesting he would not lead the campaign.Leave campaigners have been pinning their hopes on landing a big name to go up against Mr Cameron - with London Mayor Boris Johnson, who is yet to reveal which side he will back,  still their top target.

2016-02-20,'Toughest election' since devolution,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-35612495,"Welsh Labour faces its toughest election since devolution began in 1999, Carwyn Jones has said.The first minister told his party conference in Llandudno he was willing to take difficult decisions and take the flak that comes with them. Mr Jones is seeking another term in office to complete a ""decade of delivery"" that started in 2011.He said voters faced a choice between keeping him as first minister or Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies.Mr Jones, first minister since 2009, outlined the party's six key pledges for May's assembly election campaign. He also repeated a promise that Labour would not increase income taxes if the assembly gets the powers necessary.Having led the Welsh government - either alone or in coalition - for 17 years, Labour's record will come under scrutiny at the election.But Mr Jones hailed achievements in education, health and the economy under his party.Labour could not afford ""distractions"" and must keep its sights set on ""the fact that this election is a straight fight between Labour and the Tories,"" he said.""We need to be very clear in our own minds about the challenge ahead of us in May.""This will be our toughest ever assembly election campaign.""After months of infighting in Labour under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, Mr Jones said Labour needed to ""pull together, and work together, and campaign together"".Welsh Labour chairman Andy Richards said he has had ""fierce words"" with party colleagues to maintain discipline.Reacting for the Welsh Conservatives, Mr Davies said: ""Carwyn Jones's term in office can only be categorised as an abject failure and he would've been sacked years ago if he worked for a private sector firm."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn told the conference Welsh Labour had made a ""massive difference"" during its 17 years in power.He said Wales enjoyed good industrial relations, where ministers had not ""picked a fight"" with junior doctors who had gone on strike in England over new contracts.    Jeremy Corbyn got the de rigueur standing ovation for a conference speech that credited the Welsh government as an ""inspiration"" to Labour in the rest of Britain.And if any party members are not thrilled by his leadership, the message to them is clear: Bite your tongues, at least until after May's election.Welsh Labour chairman Andy Richards said he had been exchanging some ""fierce words"" with party colleagues (in private) about the need for discipline and unity in the run-up to the election.In his speech, Carwyn Jones said Labour needed to ""pull together"" to win.That message has particular resonance for Labour after the damaging rows that have gripped the party since Mr Corbyn was elected leader.

2016-02-20,EU deal gives UK special status - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35616768,"David Cameron says a deal struck with EU leaders will give the UK ""special status"" and he will campaign with his ""heart and soul"" to stay in the union.The agreement, reached late on Friday after two days of talks in Brussels, gives the UK power to limit some EU migrants' benefits.It also includes a treaty change so the UK is not bound to ""ever closer union"" with other EU member states, he said.EU exit campaigners said the ""hollow"" deal offered only ""very minor changes"".Mr Cameron is set to the announce the date of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU after a cabinet meeting which is happening at 10:00 GMT - the referendum is widely expected to be on Thursday, 23 June.Once the date is announced, ministers will be allowed to campaign for whichever side they want - one of Mr Cameron's closest political allies Michael Gove has already been named as supporting the Leave camp. Others, such as Iain Duncan Smith are expected to follow - but a question mark remains over which way London Mayor Boris Johnson will jump. The key points of the deal are: The prime minster had to make concessions to get a deal with the leaders of the 27 other EU members.Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals,  Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.The agreement on renegotiating the UK's EU membership was announced by European Council president Donald Tusk, who tweeted: ""Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for #UKinEU.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted the package of reforms would ""elicit support in the UK for the country to remain in the EU"".Mr Tusk said it ""strengthens Britain's special status"", while EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described it as ""fair"".Mr Tusk added: ""We didn't walk away from the negotiating table. We were willing to sacrifice part of our interests for the common good, to show our unity.""I deeply believe the UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people.""The ink is hardly dry on the UK's EU deal, but immediately the focus has switched to the substance of what David Cameron has achieved and - possibly an awkward question - how many of his colleagues will argue against him.The focus will move to whether the prime minister can keep his party politely together during a period of public disagreement.The ability to restrict benefits to migrants is an important victory for Mr Cameron - ammunition for his argument that he has achieved changes to help reduce the number of EU migrants coming to live and work in the UK.The proposals are complicated and do not exactly match the promises he made in the Conservative Party manifesto.But with it - and the other commitments - it becomes harder for his critics to make the case that the agreement is flimsy and will change nothing.Read more from LauraMr Cameron said he had achieved the reforms he wanted, claiming they would put the UK ""in the driving seat"" of one of the world's biggest markets and create a ""more flexible"" EU.""We have permanently protected the pound and our right to keep it,"" he added, saying that, for the first time, the EU ""has explicitly acknowledged it has more than one currency"".The prime minister said he had also protected Britain from further political integration inside the EU, adding: ""Let me put this as simply as I can: Britain will never be part of a European superstate.""Outlining his case to remain ""in a reformed Europe"", Mr Cameron said ""turning our back on the EU is no solution at all"". ""We should be suspicious of those who claim that leaving Europe is an automatic fast-track to a land of milk and honey,"" he added.""The British people must now decide whether to stay in this reformed European Union or to leave. This will be a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mr Cameron's deal as a ""sideshow"" designed to ""appease his opponents in the Conservative Party,"" adding that he had done nothing to protect jobs and fight low pay. ""We will be campaigning to keep Britain in Europe in the coming referendum, regardless of David Cameron's tinkering, because it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers,"" he said.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now ""more important than ever"" that those who supported Scotland's continued EU membership made the case ""as strongly as possible"".Eurosceptics have dismissed the reforms, saying they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or reduce migration.Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said Mr Cameron ""will now declare victory but it is an entirely hollow one"".UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""This is a truly pathetic deal. Let's Leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing £55m every day to Brussels. I believe in Britain. We are good enough to be an independent, self-governing nation outside of the EU. This is our golden opportunity.""As the EU summit was being concluded, another EU exit campaign, Grassroots Out, held a rally in Westminster.Conservative MP David Davis said it was time for Britain ""to take  control of its own destiny"", while UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the cross-party campaign was ""absolutely united in fighting to get back our democracy"".Mr Farage unveiled former Respect MP George Galloway as a ""special guest"" at the rally, describing him as a ""towering figure on the left of British politics"".What are your views on the deal and the UK's place in the EU?

2016-02-20,Lib Dem defeat blamed on 'perfect storm',https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35615285,"The Liberal Democrats' general election defeat was the result of a ""perfect storm"" including the tuition fees U-turn, a loss of activists, a weak Labour Party and an effective Tory strategy, a party review has concluded.The Lib Dems went from 57 MPs in 2010 to eight in May, triggering the resignation of leader Nick Clegg.The party's election review said its move into coalition with the Tories had not been ""well understood"".It also blamed a ""confusing"" campaign.After the Lib Dems joined the Tory-led coalition in 2010, Mr Clegg was made deputy prime minister, with several high-profile ministerial roles taken by Lib Dems.The review said Lib Dem members agreed the party was right to join the coalition ""in the national interest"" but said it had ""singularly failed at using our new position to garner support, retain and communicate our vision, or maintain a unique offer"".Ditching the party's key pledge to scrap tuition fees ""significantly damaged"" the Lib Dems' reputation and credibility, the review concluded, saying it was ""almost incomprehensible"" that 27 MPs voted in favour of an increase despite the ""carefully-negotiated"" coalition agreement allowing them to abstain.Other factors blamed for the loss of support were a lack of financial resources and campaigns with differing messages in different parts of the country as well as ""ageing members and deflated morale"" among activists.""For some MPs, local leadership took a back seat to the demands of Westminster,"" it added.When it came to the general election, the review said no party had a response to the Tories' message warning of a Labour alliance with the SNP, and criticised the Lib Dems' ""fast-changing, complicated messages"".The review -  carried out by members of the party's Campaigns and Communications Committee - made a string of recommendations to help the party fare better in any future coalition.These include that Lib Dems should make it clear they will only automatically vote for legislation covered by the coalition agreement, and that the ""wider party"" should be represented in the negotiations.Tim Farron, who replaced Mr Clegg as leader, said: ""Blame and criticism can provide short term satisfaction, but do nothing for a future vision.""This report is about setting a way forward, recognising the mistakes we made, and learning from them."""

The Scottish government says they are significant.But the involvement of the chancellor in the talks for the first time is seen by both governments as a sign of how seriously the UK side is taking the negotiations.As the EU talks in Brussels show, nothing is guaranteed. But for the first time in weeks, there's a glimmer of hope. While describing the talks as ""productive"", Mr Swinney said there were ""significant issues"" still to be resolved.He said: ""We have not managed to reach an overall agreement today, but we have made progress on a number of issues that are relevant to the agreement.""We don't have a lot of time on our side because the parliamentary scrutiny of the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework is due to commence in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, so it is important that we work with all speed to try to resolve the outstanding significant issues.""We are committed to resolving those issues and to working with the UK government to enable that, and we will concentrate on that work in the course of the next few days to try to resolve these outstanding questions.""Mr Hands said there had been a ""step forward"" in the negotiations, with ""progress being made in a number of important areas"".He said: ""The UK government is absolutely committed to implementing the Smith agreement in full and willing to go the extra mile in order to secure an agreement.""We've agreed that UK and Scottish government officials will continue discussions over the weekend and I remain confident that a deal can be reached that is fair to Scotland and fair to the rest of the UK, now and in the future.""Ms Sturgeon has previously written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter.The prime minister has said that ""no one is keener"" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to ""move towards"" his position.Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has written to Ms Sturgeon urging the Scottish government to stay at the negotiating table, saying the talks should be extended until Holyrood breaks up on 24 March if a deal is not struck next week.Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month.Holyrood's devolution committee said there would be ""very substantial impacts"" on Holyrood's ability to scrutinise the deal if matters were delayed beyond Friday, and called for a ""full explanation"" of arguments by its next meeting on 23 February.The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the ""no detriment"" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland.This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement, but the negotiating teams differ in their interpretations of this. The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an ""almost £3bn cut"", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is ""not logical"" and ""not fair"" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK.The key issue concerns population growth. With Scotland's population forecast to grow more slowly than that of the UK as a whole in coming years, the two sides differ on how Scotland's block grant should be altered to cushion against the economic impact of this.Mr Swinney said the talks had been ""productive"" in some other areas.He said: ""We have managed to resolve a number of the issues that were involved because the fiscal framework has been about a range of different issues, not just about the principle of no detriment in the block grant adjustment.""So some progress has been made, but we have outstanding questions, significant questions, that have yet to be resolved.""There are very significant powers that are being transferred to the Scottish Parliament. So we are energetic and enthusiastic about securing those powers and being able to exercise those powers, but we have said all along we can only do that if we have a fair fiscal framework in place."""
2016-02-20,Thatcher government's 'rural rioters' probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35610073,"Research into ""drunken mob violence"" in the ""shires"" was ordered by the Thatcher government, previously unseen Cabinet Office files have revealed.Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told police to investigate the problem of the ""rural rioter"", noting similarities with the ""football hooligan"".In a memorandum from June 1988, Mr Hurd said police saw violent offences in rural areas as an ""increasing burden"".The files were released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, In the memorandum, Mr Hurd noted there had been 83,000 violent offences in county and rural areas the year before - half as many again as in 1980 - and he said he was ""concerned that the problem is getting worse"".""Many of the 16 to 25-year-olds involved in these disturbances have a latent capacity for violence,"" he said.""Toughness is a proof of manhood. Drink removes their inhibitions and pushes them over the edge.""Mr Hurd dismissed the idea of having a ""rural riot squad"" to react to spontaneous disorder, saying: ""They would spend their time chasing from one end of the county to another.""Instead he proposed tougher licensing laws, quick prosecutions and exemplary sentences, and improved policing procedures.The newly-released documents also show that Margaret Thatcher's advisers urged the prime minister to force a showdown with her Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, telling him to accept her authority or quit, over the Westland affair in 1986.Mr Heseltine was backing a European consortium in its battle with the US aircraft manufacturer Sikorsky to take over British aircraft manufacturer Westland, even though the government was supposed to be neutral.Other documents show Mrs Thatcher refused to bail out the 1986 Commonwealth Games despite being asked to contribute £1m by media tycoon Robert Maxwell.And Mrs Thatcher was warned repeatedly by ministers that introducing the Poll Tax - a flat rate ""community charge"" to replace domestic rates based on property values - would be a political disaster.Welsh Secretary Peter Walker was among those to speak out, warning that a proposal to exempt rough sleepers could lead to people sleeping on the streets to avoid the charge.""While I appreciate that in practice it is highly unlikely that local authorities would be able either to track down people who sleep rough or to get any payment of the charge from them, a specific exemption could be seen as encouraging them to sleep on the street rather than in a hostel,"" he said.Widespread protests against the new tax in 1989 were seen as one of the reasons why Mrs Thatcher was forced out of Number 10 the following year."
2016-02-20,Sugar tax 'would cut future obesity',https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35604314,"A 20% tax on sugary drinks in the UK would prevent 3.7 million people becoming obese over the next decade, a report predicts.Cancer Research UK and the UK Health Forum worked out the likely impact of the tax on eating habits and, ultimately, the nation's waistlines.Their report said such a tax would also save the NHS £10m a year by 2025.The government is considering the measure, but soft drinks companies say other options would be more effective.People get between 12% and 15% of their energy from sugar, but official recommendations say it should be less than 5%.The statisticians modelled the impact of the tax and predicted a 16% reduction in the number of cans of pop consumed.Their figures were then adjusted to account for the food and drink people might turn to instead.They concluded a tax would lead to people consuming on average 15 fewer calories per day.While the difference sounds tiny, the model predicts a large impact on waistlines.Currently, 29% of people are obese and trends suggest that figure will reach 34% in 2025.Rather than reverse the obesity epidemic, the forecast predicts the tax would lead to obesity rates levelling off at around 29% - preventing 3.7 million people from becoming obese.Alison Cox, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""The ripple effect of a small tax on sugary drinks is enormous. ""These numbers make it clear why we need to act now before obesity becomes an even greater problem.""And Jane Landon, from the UK Health Forum, argued: ""Countries which have introduced a tax on sugary drinks have not only reduced consumption, they have raised much-needed revenues for public health measures.""The report has come out as the government is preparing its obesity strategy, which is due in the next few weeks.Prime Minister David Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have indicated all options are on the table, including a sugar tax.A report by Public Health England said a sugary drinks tax would cut sugar consumption ""at least in the short term"".And TV chef Jamie Oliver has campaigned for the tax saying it was the ""single most important"" change that could be made.The director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, said: ""The hypothetical claims made in this modelling study run contrary to real-world evidence. ""In fact, the soft drinks tax in Mexico has reduced average calorie intake by six calories per person per day, with no evidence that it has reduced levels of obesity.""He added that other options such as reducing portion sizes or changing ingredients would be more effective.Follow James on Twitter.Why is sugar so addictive?Michael Mosley on how much sugar is in foodCan we trust industry?"
2016-02-20,Corbyn: EU talks a 'missed opportunity',https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35606924,"David Cameron should have focused his EU renegotiations on boosting workers' rights and ending austerity, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said.Mr Corbyn told a meeting of the Party of European Socialists in Brussels the talks were a ""theatrical sideshow"".The Labour leader, who has been a critic of the EU, said his party would campaign for the UK to stay in whatever the outcome of the negotiations.Mr Cameron is hoping to win support at the EU Council summit in Brussels.If a deal is reached with other leaders, he will hold the UK's referendum on whether it wants to remain a member of the EU, with June 23 seen as the most likely date.Mr Corbyn has also travelled to Brussels where he joined a meeting of the Party of European Socialists (PES) parliamentary bloc.He said: ""David Cameron's negotiations are a missed opportunity to make the case for the real reforms the EU needs: democratisation, stronger workers' rights, an end to austerity, and a halt to the enforced privatisation of public services.""Mr Corbyn voted to leave the European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, in the 1975 referendum, when the UK voted strongly to remain in. During last year's Labour leadership campaign, Mr Corbyn said he had ""mixed feelings"" on the union and suggested there were circumstances in which he would advocate a vote to leave.In September he confirmed Labour would campaign to stay in the EU but criticised it over free trade, agriculture and Greece.Speaking after the PES meeting, Mr Corbyn said Mr Cameron had ""brought an internal Conservative Party dispute to international proportions"".He said Labour had made its backing for EU membership ""very, very clear"" saying this was supported by the ""vast majority"" of its membership.His desired reforms, he said, were ""rather different"" to Mr Cameron's.""It has to be based on the rights of people all across Europe,"" he said.""I don't think David Cameron has that on his agenda."""
2016-02-20,Probe into Tory Thanet South spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35605518,"A probe has been launched into claims about the Conservative Party's spending during the general election in the UKIP-contested seat of Thanet South, the Electoral Commission has said.The claims - made by Channel 4 - allege that some bills were wrongly declared in the party's spending returns.The commission said it would look at bills for two hotels in the Kent constituency.A Conservative spokesman said spending was all legal and ""correctly recorded"".During last year's election UKIP's Nigel Farage lost out in the race for South Thanet seat to the Conservative Party's Craig Mackinlay.The rules around candidate spending and any potential criminal offence can only be investigated by the police under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983 - not the Electoral Commission.But while the commission has no powers to investigate or sanction alleged candidate spending offences, it does have powers in relation to national campaign spending.Kent Police says it will not pursue an investigation over individual candidate spending in Thanet South during the commission's review.""At this stage the matter will sit with the Electoral Commission. Kent Police officers will liaise closely with the Electoral Commission and investigate if appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said.The commission said it would specifically consider whether stays at the Royal Harbour Hotel in Ramsgate and the Premier Inn in Margate, should have been included in national campaign spending or not. ""The investigation opened by the commission today focuses on whether the Conservative Party met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act,"" a statement said.The commission's sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000.The allegations were first made by on 20 January and relate to how much an individual can spend on their campaign during an election.The commission said that during what was defined as the ""short campaign"" - which ran from 30 March to 7 May - £8,700 could be spent, plus 6p for every ""registered parliamentary elector"".In his blog Michael Crick - the political correspondent for Channel 4 - said the legal expense limit in Thanet South for that period was £15,016."
2016-02-20,Troops to Teachers sees 28 qualify,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35595424," A flagship scheme to bring ex-servicemen and women to England's classrooms has seen 28 veterans qualify as teachers since it started.Former Education Secretary Michael Gove had hoped to attract 2,000 applicants to the £4.3m Troops to Teachers scheme.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said the low numbers showed the government had failed to get a grip on the teacher shortage crisis.The government said the scheme's impact was positive and set to grow.It stressed the figures, revealed in a written answer to a parliamentary question, referred to the first round of trainees to graduate from the scheme.In another answer, schools minister Nick Gibb said a total of 551 applications had been received for the scheme, which began training people in 2014.This led to 41 individuals starting the programme in its first year. Since then 28 of the 29 who completed the programme had achieved qualified teacher status (QTS), he said.Ms Powell said: ""I very much want to see more veterans re-training to become teachers as they have a huge amount to offer and we desperately need more good teachers.  ""What's clear is that, as with the government's general slow response to teacher shortages, this scheme isn't working because the government isn't focusing on teacher recruitment.  ""We urgently need a proper strategy for teacher recruitment, including of veterans for whom this could make a great second career.""It was back in 2008 that the then shadow education secretary Michael Gove, backed a UK version of an American programme to get ex-servicemen teaching in England's schools.Within months of taking office, he announced plans for the Troops to Teachers programme.But the simplicity of the idea, giving soldiers leaving Afghanistan and Iraq future careers and getting a bit of military discipline in classrooms, has been belied by its delivery.Challenges lay in working across two government departments - education and defence.The programme is part of the DfE's commitment to the cross-government Military Covenant, which aims to help support service leavers get back into civilian life.Many applicants did not have the pre-requisite qualifications or could not stay the rather demanding course of becoming a teacher - despite their Army heroics.And as teaching unions have warned, there is no direct correlation between a good service record and being good teacher material.But ministers are convinced the scheme is good and that it can still be a success.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""The 28 graduates referred to are the first trainees to be recruited and completed their two-year course at the end of December. ""A further two cohorts are being trained right now which means that more than 140 former troops are working in our classrooms and record numbers of eligible applicants have applied for the latest cohort.""These figures relate to recruitment for 2016.The spokesman added: ""The impact of these recruits in the classroom has been overwhelmingly positive with head teachers praising the influence they've had on pupils' attainment.""It is not the first time the low take-up of the scheme has been in the news. In July 2014, the BBC News website reported the scheme had sent a total of 41 trainees to England's classrooms in its first year.The revelation comes just a week after a National Audit Office report highlighted how the government had missed its teacher recruitment targets for four years in a row.The Troops to Teachers scheme, run by the University of Brighton, is based on the idea that military values such as leadership, discipline, motivation and teamwork are particularly useful for teaching. First mooted in 2008, it provides non-graduate recruits with on-the-job training four days a week, with one day reserved for academic study.Trainees go straight into the school-based programme after a minimum of one week's work experience in a school. They start to teach after spending two terms observing.After two years, trainees count as ""newly qualified teachers"" and gain an honours degrees in education, specialising either as secondary school subject teachers or as primary school teachers. Some teaching unions criticised the entry requirements for the scheme and questioned the notion that a good service record meant a candidate would make a good teacher."

""How are such basic, avoidable mistakes still happening? There is clearly a lack of learning in the NHS.""It is especially unforgivable to operate on the wrong organ, and many such mistakes can never be rectified.""NHS England insisted never events were rare - affecting one in every 20,000 procedures - and that the majority of the 4.6 million hospital operations each year were safe.A spokeswoman said: ""One never event is too many and we mustn't underestimate the effect on the patients concerned. ""To better understand the reasons why, in 2013 we commissioned a taskforce to investigate, leading to a new set of national standards being published last year specifically to support doctors, nurses and hospitals to prevent these mistakes.""Any organisation that reports a serious incident is also expected to conduct its own investigation so it can learn and take action to prevent similar incidents from being repeated."""

2016-02-20,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-20,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-20,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-20,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday, 23 June.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups.  Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"", and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-20,Balanced deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35620821,"David Cameron will now begin the campaign that will define his legacy and his time in office. The battleground for the next four months has been laid out. The prime minister and the ""in"" campaign will insist that the UK's relationship with the EU has been fundamentally changed, with several key demands met.But those who want to leave the UK say it is a ""hollow deal"", that the negotiations were weak in their ambition and Britain has not regained control over its laws or its borders. They question whether the emergency brake on migrant benefits will have any impact on immigration numbers - and point out that the legislation on this will have to be passed by the European Parliament only AFTER Britain has voted in a referendum. And the critics whose ambition is to see powers being returned to Westminster will also point out that the UK has not regained the right to over-rule EU laws. So that is the battleground at home but Mr Cameron had also claimed there ""was a big prize for everyone in the room"" in fundamentally reforming the EU. But the other member states did not choose to seize this moment to embrace wider reforms, underscoring that Britain remains exceptional, the outsider.The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the settlement addressed all of the Prime Minister's concerns ""without compromising our fundamental values"". For the rest of the EU that was crucial. There was the will to help David Cameron but the other leaders were not prepared to weaken the EU's core beliefs.Freedom of movement has not been compromised. The march towards deeper integration has not been slowed. The President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be ""no power of veto over the eurozone"" - not that Britain was seeking that. What the French wanted to underline was that Britain would not win any ""exceptions to the rules of the EU"" - particularly in relation to regulation in the City.Even so some European leaders are uncomfortable. This deal recognises that there are different layers of integration. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said: ""There is a risk of us losing sight of the original European dream.""  Belgium was greatly exercised that other countries might want to opt out from further integration. There is an underlying fear of contagion that other countries might seek similar opt-outs, so leading to an unravelling of the EU. In the end, the political battle will almost certainly not be fought on the details of this deal. It will be fought over the economic risks of leaving the EU and whether the UK can regain control over its laws and borders."
2016-02-20,Risking it all,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35599680,"It gets cold, very very cold, waiting at the entrance of the European Council building in Brussels. You can spend several hours being jostled by French camera crews, squashed by Italian snappers, or shoved unceremoniously out of the way by any one of 27 other countries' journalists as the leaders of the European Union arrive one by one, and we frantically try to grab a word with them as they rush past. There'll be sharp elbows in the press pen, craning of necks and stretching of microphones, as David Cameron arrives at this summit, which could define not just his leadership, but the future of his party and his country's place in the world. But how on earth did the man who once accused the Conservatives of being out of touch for ""banging on about Europe"", get himself into a position where he has already been ""banging on about Europe"" for months and months, and will spend the next four months still doing precisely that? Since he made that claim in his first season as party leader in 2006, appearing in front of a huge video screen tastefully projected with a giant tree, there have been three big changes, linked, that have got him to this juncture, which of course ultimately is a product of his own political calculation.Most simply, as the years have passed, his party has changed. Since the Maastricht rebels failed to get a public vote in 1993 on the treaty that created the modern version of the European Union, there has been a rump of Conservatives deeply passionate about the cause, significantly concerned that the EU's laws, not Britain's own, are more important - the question of sovereignty that's a big part of the current talks. But their concerns, while shared by many Conservative Party members, were not considered mainstream in the parliamentary party - balanced, if not squeezed out, by heavyweight Europhile voices. But as the EU expanded, and generations of MPs came and went, a soft scepticism towards the European project, neither full-throated support, nor hardcore opposition, became more common, and sympathy for the idea of a referendum spread from the margins. The eurozone financial crisis, and the EU's stumbling approach to sorting it out, gave a fresh energy to eurosceptic MPs who wanted to campaign to leave.  In part that apathy, if not downright dislike, towards the EU spread because of the enormous rise in the numbers of people from around the Union who came to live and work in the UK. Numbers that took the political establishment completely by surprise began to arrive from the moment new countries like Poland joined the EU in 2004. There is a complicated, and emotional debate about the impact of the numbers, but few can dispute that the effect has been very significant in some parts of the country, with figures this week showing the numbers still rising, standing at more than two million now. For many people, that very visible impact of our membership of the EU has given them pause for thought.And it was that steep rise in EU immigration that gave David Cameron his most pressing political reason for - in the end - promising a referendum. UKIP's appeal grew alongside the rise in immigration. By 2012, they were greedily nibbling at the Conservative vote with a record performance in the local elections and a leader who in some moments seemed to appeal to swathes of the public for his plain speaking, in a style that also alienated many others. A drive to address the threat from UKIP and satisfy growing internal demands for the promise of a referendum led eventually to Mr Cameron's commitment in the 2013 speech to give the public a vote on whether to stay or go. It's worth remembering that, perhaps strangely, the 2013 speech in which he made his promise to hold a vote made no mention of immigration. But add a general election and increasing public concern to the mix and three years later, his hopes of limiting benefits for migrants are the centrepiece of his renegotiation. The prime minister is not a politician who is known for getting hung up on the past, his seemingly bomb-proof - if maybe sometimes misplaced - confidence in his own abilities tends to lead him to look forward. He is not a prisoner of his record. But as he arrives in Brussels on Thursday, and gets out of the shiny black limousine to sweep past the journalists clamouring to ask a question, will he consider even, for a moment, the irony that he may be risking it all for something he once more or less dismissed as a fringe concern?"
2016-02-20,Why it's all about you,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35612584,"It's not about him. Or his deal. Or what he did or did not negotiate in the middle of the night.And it's not about them. Or what they say. Or what they think of what he did or did not achieve.No, this is now all about you. And your country. And what you will decide.That's because after all the talk about the prime minister's haggling in Brussels, you now have a say just as big as he does on one of the most important questions the country has ever faced - should we stay or go, should we be in or out, should we remain or leave the European Union?The British people will now get to make that choice in what many have demanded for so long - a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union, which is likely to be held on Thursday 23 June.If you're under 58 years old, it's a choice you've never had.If you're older than that, you had the chance to vote in a referendum in 1975 on our membership of what was then known as the Common Market, or EEC, but you may feel - as many older voters do - that the UK is now part of something very different.The next few days will be dominated by arguments about the details of the deal David Cameron has negotiated with the 27 other EU leaders. Will it cut the number of people moving here from Europe? Will it protect British business from decisions taken by and in the interests of the eurozone? Will it prevent the UK from being sucked into ""ever closer union"" or what some call a federal Europe?Will it make it easier for national politicians to stop those in Brussels imposing unwanted new rules or laws? Will whatever was agreed stand up in Europe's courts and parliaments?However, the decision that you will face in four months' time will, I suspect, be dominated by more fundamental questions. Would we be richer, would we be safer, would we have more control of our own destiny, would we have more influence in the world if we chose to remain or to leave? There won't, of course, be any space on the ballot paper to say, ""I'd like to stay if only there was less interference from Brussels or bureaucracy or immigration, or if only there was more democracy"". There won't be an opportunity to say ""I'd like to leave if I could be sure the EU won't make it harder or more expensive to sell our goods, or force us to allow Europe's people to move here freely if we want our goods and services and money to move freely there"".No, the choice will be a simple, plain, black and white one - remain or leave. No ifs, no buts, no maybes. It will involve making a judgement on what the future might be like one way or another. No expert can simply tell you what you should or should not believe. I'm often told that it doesn't matter how you vote because ""they"" were all the same, all in it for themselves and nothing ever changed. You can't say that about this vote. It matters. It will make a difference. And it's not about Cameron, or Boris's or Corbyn's future. It is about you and yours and your country's.

2016-02-20,Business partners,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35615027,"Britain and the Republic of Ireland were once historical adversaries but now are close trading neighbours.The Irish government wants Britain to remain in the EU fearing that uncertainty over what might happen to relations with one of its biggest trading partners could have a big impact on the Irish economy just recovering from a deep recession. Ronnie Ritchie runs one of Ireland's oldest sweet-makers, HG Ritchie in Dublin. The traditional manufacturing methods could remind you of Willie Wonka's chocolate factory, with vast piles of the sweets of an Irish childhood everywhere. But the stuff that makes them sweet - sugar - comes from Britain.""Our biggest worry about the British leaving the EU would be our supply of sugar,"" he says.His business mirrors Ireland generally, with significant trade across the Irish Sea, in both directions. A mini-mountain of bagged coloured sweets is destined for Scotland where the retro sweets unknown to Ritchie's connoisseurs in Ireland have a loyal following.  ""They're a product called Oddfellows, they were made in King's of Wishaw. When that factory closed down we took over the manufacturing here. ""We've exported to a factory called James Ross's of Edinburgh since then and continue to do so. It's a big, big line in Scotland and important to our trade.""""It's a case of suck it and see,"" he jokes of the UK leaving the EU, but says it's a worry. ""Our main concern here is the possibility of inconsistencies of supply should the barriers go up. No-one likes not knowing what's coming next."" ""Are we going to have to go through customs to bring products through again - or are we going to have to dodge England and go around to Europe?""That's only going to increase our costs, and for an island manufacturer that's really impossible in the current climate.""Ireland will shortly remember 50 years since Irish militants blew up Nelson's Pillar in Dublin, which was similar to the column in Trafalgar Square. But relations today could not be more different, and are closer than ever since political peace was forged in Northern Ireland in 1998.Near where Nelson once stood, a branch of Ann Summers, the UK-based lingerie and sex toys chain, now fights for business opposite where the Irish rebels fought in the GPO in 1916 on O'Connell Street. Trade between Ireland and Britain has soared since 1998: one-third of Irish imports come from the UK, which is where one-sixth of Irish exports are sold in a two-way trade worth around €1bn (£775m) a week. IBEC, which represents Ireland's employers, wants the UK to stay in the EU. But while the UK is a trade partner for Ireland it is also a major competitor - vying to woo investment from big US and international companies, which Ireland has attracted - helped by low corporation tax. IBEC fears that Brexit could free British business from EU regulations and laws, and chief executive Danny McCoy believes it could give the UK competitive advantage in the battle for inward investment. ""The fact that Britain would have more flexibilities potentially around issues like state-aid rules, the labour market or European Court of Justice decisions - all of these things could be quite game-changing in the competitive position of Ireland versus Britain. ""So I think that for Irish business, by far the best outcome for the referendum is Britain staying in Europe.""He accepts that that could be construed by some in Britain as an argument for leaving the EU - which he opposes.""Absolutely, it could well be - but there's much more dimension to the European decision than just the business dimension or the investment decision. ""Access to the single market is going to be crucial for British businesses but also, more widely, security concerns and a whole raft of other European interactivity.""IBEC says an EU without Britain would also see the loss of a huge player, which it argues would be bad for Europe. ""Britain will be the largest EU economy in our lifetime. With current projections for population, Britain will exceed Germany,"" he says.Dublin today feels a much more European city than in the days Lord Nelson towered over its skyline with EU enlargement bringing many new nationalities to live in the city. Continental influences like cafes and culture are everywhere, but in trade too, with around 45% of Irish exports going to continental EU, almost three times as much as go to the UK.Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) make up around 98% of Irish companies and provide over 70% of private sector jobs. Britain is still important for these firms which are the backbone of Ireland's economy, says Mark Fielding, chief executive of ISME which represents over 10,000 firms. He believes that while Britain leaving the EU would be significant it would not be a disaster because many Irish firms have found new markets during the recent recession.""Because there was a recession in the UK as well, many SMEs had to find other markets.""We found that many of our member companies were exporting into the EU - France, Germany and further afield - rather than looking at the old reliable, the UK.""Perhaps Ireland's best-known commercial economist is Robbie Kelleher of financial services group Davy. Once a top Gaelic footballer for Dublin in the 1970s, he's not lost his knack for keeping an eye on the sporting odds which he says are against Brexit - a British exit from the EU. Whatever the outcome, he believes business will adapt. ""Currently the polls are putting it about 50-50 that they'll stay in or go out. ""The bookies who usually know a little bit more about these things than others are actually quoting 3/1-on that they are going to stay in - so it (Brexit) may not happen, and my own instinct is that it won't happen.""The spectre of customs controls along the Northern Ireland border or restrictions on trade between here and Britain is far-fetched and highly unlikely.""  In Dublin's pubs, the political talk is all about Ireland's general election but with more murmurs about a UK exit too. Some see it like the Y2K millennium bug or a lot of fuss about nothing - but others fear the unknown. Whatever the outcome Irish business will be hoping there'll be no big hangover afterwards. "
2016-02-20,Summit to eat?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35615291,"It has been billed as the crunch summit where David Cameron battles to secure agreement for his EU reforms.But as the talks have dragged on, a sub-plot has kept waiting press entertained, with a succession of ""English"" meals dangled before the 28 leaders - only to be whisked away as negotiations extend longer than planned. First up:This was how aides to European Council president Donald Tusk billed what were to be Friday morning's triumphant talks sealing the deal. Had it been called an ""all-day breakfast"" they would have been covered. But the 8am fry-up was touted as the key to reaching a deal if there was no agreement on Thursday night.With ""no real progress"" made, it was pushed back to 11am, giving it more of an air of a brunch. As it happened though, the bilateral talks carried on.As announced by European Council president Donald Tusk's spokesman, it was then put back to 14:00, before going the way of the breakfast and the brunch.Or, as an EU spokesman put it, ""late English lunch"". With Europe's leaders still at loggerheads, tired and surely starving, would a plate of sandwiches and scones help bridge the gap? It was meant to take place at 15:30 Brussels time, 7.5 hours after the promised breakfast.But the scones never materialised.No sign of a deal, and no sign of that meal, as the breakfast/brunch/lunch morphed into an ""English dinner"" - with the time to be confirmed:The ""English"" tag attached to each meal did not go unnoticed, as some wondered why other parts of the UK were not contributing.Speculation raged as to what the dinner could consist of:We might find out, with an EU source suggesting a ""good chance"" of a deal over dinner. But German chancellor Angela Merkel was taking no chances as she popped out for a bag of chips.She might need the extra sustenance, as leaders have been told to book a hotel room for an extra night - so they could be contemplating that English breakfast all over again."
2016-02-20,Seeking to avoid Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20160220234242/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35620434,"Reino Unido, Grossbritannien, Storbritannien, Grande-Bretagne - whichever corner of this overcrowded, shouty press centre you stumbled through the last couple of days at this European summit you heard ""Great Britain"" being reported on - loudly and with lots of gesticulating hand movements in a multitude of European languages.Britain has done it again. It paraded itself on the EU stage as being more equal than the other equals in a union of 28. In the past, the UK has managed to negotiate a rebate from the EU budget, exempted itself from joining the euro and has arranged quite a number of opt-outs on EU legislation.A ""special status agreement"" is how the summit host, European Council President Donald Tusk, described the UK-EU reform package negotiated late on Friday by David Cameron. He got special treatment too. Tradition dictates that the first post-summit press conference is held by Mr Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission.It is usually followed by a mass cacophony of EU leaders' pressers all taking place more or less at the same time. On Friday though, Mr Cameron was allowed to preside over the podium alone for a full 20 minutes, elaborating on and crowing over his deal, speaking of the EU largely as an enrichment tool for Britons. A body the UK could benefit from or ignore depending on its usefulness. ""The best of both worlds,"" he said.Follow reaction to the Brussels dealHis European peers - who have spent weeks and months on these negotiations for Britain - must have been biting their tongue - hard - when they heard his tone. I saw a number of colleagues in this most European of press rooms bristle.Gone was the shuttle diplomacy of David Cameron, who invested so many air miles charming, listening to and selling his reform plan to other EU leaders. In his place was a British conservative prime minister gearing up for a divisive referendum at home on EU membership.""I do not love Brussels. I love Britain,"" avowed David Cameron.""When it comes to Europe, mine is a hard-headed assessment of what is in our national interest."" But then the other EU leaders acted in their national interest too. Their hard-headed decision was that it's better for them if the UK stays in the EU.""If GB goes, the rest of us have nothing,"" Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas told me.In the meantime, he and the others put on semi-theatrics for their voters around protecting their rights against David Cameron's reforms. Central and Eastern Europeans pushed back against cutting EU migrant benefits. France bared its teeth over safeguards for the City of London from eurozone legislation.But in the end, they pretty much gave David Cameron what he wanted. A decent deal on narrow but key issues.Not the fundamental change in EU-UK relations he had initially promised but enough, he hopes, to encourage the majority of his party and the British public to vote ""Yes"" to staying in the EU come referendum time. Dalia Grybauskaite , Lithuania's outspoken president, became the media darling at this summit, winning hack hearts and minds when she predicted from the first moment that: ""Everyone will have their own drama. And then we will agree.""And so it was.And now the leaders of the EU institutions - the Commission, European Parliament and Council who clearly enjoyed being the focus of and lead-story trigger for the hungry-for-any-details British press during the negotiations - will have to endure returning to relative UK obscurity once again.As the UK media now turns its sights to Westminster and the referendum itself."

But he said that the EU ""only really listen to a population when it says no"".""This is a moment to be brave, to reach out - not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else,"" he wrote.""This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule.""A vote to Remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy.""Mr Johnson, who is the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, is believed to have informed Mr Cameron of his decision to campaign for the UK to leave the union by text message shortly before making it public at 17:00 GMT.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson's decision would be seen as a huge boost to the Out campaign and a major blow to the prime minister, who had hoped to persuade friends and rivals to back the campaign to remain.In his column Mr Johnson added: ""It is time to seek a new relationship, in which we manage to extricate ourselves from most of the supranational elements. ""We will hear a lot in the coming weeks about the risks of this option; the risk to the economy, the risk to the City of London, and so on; and though those risks cannot be entirely dismissed, I think they are likely to be exaggerated."" Addressing reporters outside his home in north London, Mr Johnson had said the EU was a ""political project"" that was in ""real danger of getting out of proper democratic control"".Mr Johnson also denied his decision had anything to do with leadership ambitions, stressing that he had made up his mind ""after a huge amount of heartache"" and the last thing he wanted to do was defy Mr Cameron.He said he would be backing the Vote Leave campaign - one of two groups seeking official designation as the exit campaign group - but ruled out taking part in TV debates against members of his party.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's father Stanley Johnson told BBC Radio 5 live he disagreed with his son's argument that the UK should leave the EU because it threatened British sovereignty.He denied Mr Johnson's decision had been a ""career move"", saying he had ""completely thrown away"" any chance of a post inside Mr Cameron's cabinet by aligning himself against the prime minister.Boris Johnson is political box office. He is one of Britain's most charismatic politicians. So his decision to support Brexit gives popular appeal to a Leave campaign that has lacked a talismanic figurehead.And polls suggest that his is a voice that many will listen to as they make up their minds. So the Mayor of London will transform the referendum campaign. But will he transform the result?Until now Mr Johnson has won his votes as a jovial character in two regional elections. He is now testing his appeal on the national stage in a contest of historic importance. And that matters because Mr Johnson could be our prime minister one day.Read more from JamesSpeaking to the BBC before Mr Johnson's announcement, Mr Cameron had issued a last-ditch plea to Mr Johnson to back staying in the EU.He said if Mr Johnson cared about ""getting things done"" in the world, being a member of the EU was key.And, he added, ""linking arms"" with Nigel Farage and George Galloway - part of the Grassroots Out movement which is also vying to become the official Leave campaign - was ""taking a leap into the dark and is the wrong step for our country"".Mr Johnson's decision to back leaving the EU drew criticism from former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, who called it ""illogical"".""If it takes you this long to make up your mind about something so fundamental and you still have questions, then surely the right option is to stay with what you know rather than risk our economy and security with a leap in the dark,"" he said.Among the cabinet members backing the Out campaign are Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Justice Secretary Michael Gove.Zac Goldsmith, who is hoping to become Mr Johnson's successor as a Conservative London mayor in May, has also said he will vote to leave."

2016-02-21,Staying in EU 'increases UK terror risk',https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35624409,"Staying in the EU will make the UK more vulnerable to Paris-style terrorist attacks, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has told the BBC. Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for an EU exit, also questioned the effectiveness of curbs to migrants' benefits on immigration to the UK.The senior minister's comments directly contradict David Cameron, who says the UK is ""safer and stronger"" in the EU.The PM told the BBC that leaving the EU would be ""a leap in the dark"".Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he also warned that leaving would give the UK an ""illusion of sovereignty"" but not full control.And Mr Cameron appealed to senior Conservative MP and London mayor Boris Johnson, who is expected to announce later that he will vote to leave the EU, to back the campaign to stay.His pitch came as Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith said he would campaign for exit in the 23 June referendum.Meanwhile, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said a vote to leave would mean the UK was ""in charge of our own country"".This is the new, if temporary reality: cabinet ministers disagreeing totally with each other on the record, and in public. Traditionally unthinkable, certainly risky, and difficult to control.Plenty of disagreements are spilling out into the public domain now. But while Boris Johnson keeps his counsel, not for very much longer, there is of course huge speculation not just about what he is going to do, but about what his motivations are.Read more from LauraSpeaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Duncan Smith said that being a member of the EU ""leaves the door open"" to attacks such as those in Paris last year.He suggested migrants arriving in the EU could eventually end up in the UK without proper consideration of their motivations. ""This open border does not allow us to check and control people that may come and spend time,"" he said.""We've seen what happened in Paris where they spent ages planning and plotting so who's to say it's not beyond the wit of man that those might already be thinking about that.""Asked directly whether he believed EU membership made the UK more vulnerable to Paris-style attacks, he replied: ""I think the present status of the open border we have right now many of us feel does actually leave that door open and we need to see that resolved.""Mr Duncan Smith also questioned whether proposals for an ""emergency brake"" on migrants' benefits - part of the deal negotiated by Mr Cameron - would do much to curb the number of people coming to the UK.Benefit payments were a ""small"" pull factor but control of the UK's borders was more significant and a ""glaring area"" that needed addressing.He noted that the initial plan was for an emergency brake on migration but the EU ""point blank refused to even discuss it"".Earlier, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Cameron defended his renegotiation of Britain's terms of EU membership, reached after two days of intense wrangling with EU leaders in Brussels this week.He said he had secured reforms ""people said weren't achievable"", including curbs to migrants' benefits and exempting Britain from ""ever closer union"". The offer on the table was a ""better"" deal for the UK and would be ""legally binding"", he said.Making his case for why Britain should stay in a ""reformed"" EU, Mr Cameron said it would safeguard the UK position in the single market and help in the fight against terrorism and crime. ""Safety in numbers in a dangerous world,"" he said.Proponents of Britain leaving the EU have argued it would give Britain back control of itself.But Mr Cameron warned: ""If we leave the EU that might give you a feeling of sovereignty - but is it real?""Would you have power to help businesses not be discriminated against in Europe? No,  you wouldn't. Would you have the power to insist European countries share with us their border information so we know what terrorists and criminals are doing in Europe? No, you wouldn't.""So you have an illusion of sovereignty but you don't have power, don't have control, you can't get things done.""He said he would be bringing forward proposals ""in the coming days"" to underpin the power of the UK Parliament.Mr Cameron also appealed to Mr Johnson not to join six ministers who attend cabinet in campaigning to leave the EU.""I'd say to Boris as I say to everyone else - we will be safer, stronger, better off inside the EU.""I think the prospect of linking arms with Nigel Farage and George Galloway and taking a leap into the dark is the wrong step for our country.""And if Boris and others really care about getting things done in our world, the EU is one of the ways in which we get things done,"" he said.Also on the Marr Show, Mr Farage criticised the scope of the PM's reform deal, and said it could be vetoed by the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.""There is one absolute certainty if we vote to leave... and that is that we will be in charge of our own country, we will make our own laws, we will run our own ministerial departments,"" he said.Employment minister Priti Patel, who is campaigning for an EU exit, told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics that the referendum was a chance for the UK to ""take back control"".By remaining a member of the EU, key decisions made in the UK risked ""being ridden over roughshod"" by EU institutions, she said.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that if the UK voted to leave the EU but Scotland did not, it would ""almost certainly"" trigger demands for another referendum on Scottish independence.Meanwhile, Hilary Benn, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC's Sunday Politics that EU membership was ""good for jobs, investment and growth"".He said ""the whole Labour movement"" would be campaigning to stay in, but he ruled out sharing a platform with Mr Cameron.""We make our own arguments in our way to try and win the case and the prime minister can do the same in his way with his party and the people that he is seeking to persuade,"" he said.Splits in the cabinet over the referendum have been laid bare by interviews and articles in Sunday's newspapers.Writing in the Observer, Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said ""leaving the EU would be a threat to our economic security and our national security"". In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Business Secretary Sajid Javid said he would be voting for the UK to remain in the EU with a ""heavy heart"" and no ""enthusiasm"". He said leaving the EU could add to ""economic turbulence"". However, Justice Secretary Michael Gove - a close friend and ally of Mr Cameron - wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that the EU was ""mired in the past"". He said choosing to join the leave campaign had been ""the most difficult decision of my political life"".Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers told the BBC leaving the EU was a safer option than staying in it.She said there had been a sense of history at the cabinet meeting to discuss the vote - the first to be called on a Saturday since the Falklands War.Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who is leading Labour's campaign to stay in the EU, said people should not be distracted by Conservative divisions over Europe, saying the referendum was about ""much more important issues"".Referring to the cabinet members who are campaigning for an EU exit, he said ""they're not the six most astute politicians that I've ever met in the cabinet"".Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems have said they are in favour of staying in the EU. The DUP said it will recommend voting to leave the bloc.Read more"
2016-02-21,"Relax Sunday trading laws, MPs say",https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35623976,"Rules on Sunday opening hours for shops in England and Wales are out of date and need to be relaxed, a group of 200 MPs and council leaders has said.In a letter to the Sunday Telegraph, they wrote that increasing spending on Sundays would boost job prospects and help shops compete with online firms.They backed government plans to devolve Sunday trading laws to local councils.However, the shopworkers' union said the majority of its members opposed extended Sunday trading hours.In the letter, the group - which includes the cross-party British Infrastructure Group (BIG) of MPs - said the world had changed ""a great deal"" since Sunday trading laws were last updated in 1994.""Yet whilst times and attitudes have changed, Sunday Trading laws have stayed the same,"" they wrote.""Our high streets and physical retailers have been left trying to compete with 24/7 online shopping, a task which is made harder by a shortened trading day at the weekend, just when many families might hope to go shopping together.""In England and Wales, shops over 280 sq m, or 3,000 sq ft, in size can open their doors for only six consecutive hours between 10:00 and 18:00. Retailers can be fined up to £50,000 if they break the rules.There are no trading restrictions in Scotland, while in Northern Ireland shops can open for up to five hours between 13:00 and 18:00.The letter supported a report by the BIG, which backs the modernisation of ""outdated retail law"".The group includes more than 40 MPs and is led by former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps.Its report argued the trend across Europe is for ""liberalising"" Sunday trading laws, saying that changes on the continent resulted in a 7‐9% net increase in employment.The Sunday Telegraph letter added: ""Ultimately, we believe that the best way to determine whether large shops are open for longer than six hours on a Sunday is to hand this decision to local communities. ""It is for this reason that we back the proposed change in England and Wales which would update our trading laws for the 21st Century.""Campaigners opposed to longer opening hours question if the move would really benefit the High Street, pointing out that under the existing law, smaller traders are allowed to open for longer.Last year, Chancellor George Osborne promised that councils and mayors would get the power to set Sunday trading laws in their areas.Business Secretary Sajid Javid earlier this month said ministers plan to press ahead with the proposal, saying the move would allow local authorities to ""help struggling high streets"".However, it faces strong opposition in the Commons.And retail union, Usdaw, has said the current trading hours give ""everyone a little bit of what they want"".""Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work; whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shop workers can spend some time with their family,"" general secretary John Hannett said."
2016-02-21,Leaving EU is safer option - Villiers,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622560,"The Northern Ireland Secretary says she will vote to leave the EU ""to take back control over our country and making our laws and controlling our borders"". Theresa Villiers said there were ""risks on both sides of this debate"" but the ""safer option"" was to leave.Ms Villiers said the UK could then ""negotiate a new deal based on free trade and co-operation"". So far, she is one of five full members of the cabinet in favour of leaving the EU, with 16 supporting staying.Others who have joined the Leave campaign are Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Iain Duncan Smith and John Whittingdale.EU Referendum: Where Conservative MPs standGove: Britain 'freer, fairer and better off outside the EU'Mr Cameron has warned that leaving the European Union would be a ""leap in the dark"", as he urged voters to back his reform deal. The PM said: ""Those who want to leave Europe cannot tell you if British businesses would be able to access Europe's free trade single market, or if working people's jobs are safe, or how much prices would rise.""All they're offering is a risk at a time of uncertainty - a leap in the dark.""Ms Villiers, who was an MEP for six years, said she did not think the EU system was ""capable of changing in a way that would be the right option for us"". She said: ""In the decades ahead we face a European project that is ever more determined to integrate, to take more powers and we could be outvoted many times over the years to come.""So there is no stable status quo for us to cling to.""Even with this deal [negotiated with EU leaders by David Cameron] we will still be subject to the Court of European Justice who may still do its best to unpick the deal that's been agreed."" Ms Villiers said she was ""profoundly optimistic"" about the UK, which she said could ""flourish outside the EU"". She said Mr Cameron had won ""important concessions"" in Brussels.""But the reality is a really radical way to change our relationship is to vote to leave and then negotiate a deal based on the trade and co-operation that people thought we were signing up to when we joined the European Union.""It's long overdue that people have a right to decide on this, David Cameron is delivering that.""Ms Villiers said there had been ""a sense of history"" at Saturday's cabinet meeting at which ministers discussed which way they would vote in the referendum in June.""It was quite emotional. It was also very measured, very objective, very sincere,"" she said.""There was a determination that we wanted it to be a high-quality debate so people can make an informed choice, and to work courteously with each other even if we find ourselves on different sides.""She said it was ""very difficult to be on a different side"" to Mr Cameron but she didn't believe the divisions in the cabinet would lead to civil war in the Conservative Party. ""Ultimately, [it is] the arguments about what is good for our future, what will generate the best prosperity, what will make us most secure that will determine how people vote in the referendum - not how each cabinet member will vote.""The Republic of Ireland's main opposition party criticised Ms Villiers' decision, saying it was ""wrong for Northern Ireland"" and ""deeply worrying"".Fianna Fail spokesman on foreign affairs Brendan Smith said:  ""Secretary Villiers is entitled to her own views on this matter and that must be fully respected.""However, I believe it is clear that a Brexit would be bad for Northern Ireland and bad for Irish-British relations."""
2016-02-21,Cameron calls EU referendum for June,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35621079,"The UK will vote on whether to remain in the EU on Thursday 23 June, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.The prime minister made his historic announcement in Downing Street after briefing the cabinet.He said he would be campaigning to remain in a reformed EU - and described the vote as one of the biggest decisions ""in our lifetimes"".Ministers immediately divided up into the leave and remain camps as the campaigns got under way in earnest.The referendum date announcement comes after renegotiations on the UK's relationship with Europe were finalised on Friday night after intense wrangling at a two-day summit in Brussels.The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, include changes to migrant welfare payments, safeguards for Britain's financial services and making it easier to block unwanted EU regulations.Some Conservative MPs have announced their intention to back the prime minister. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. But many Conservatives have announced they will back the leave campaign including Mr Cameron's long-time ally, Justice Secretary Michael Gove.London Mayor Boris Johnson, who has previously been a Eurosceptic, has yet to declare where he stands.On Sunday, he is expected to confirm he will campaign for out, but has told friends he is genuinely conflicted, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says.Number 10 is resigned to him opposing them following a meeting this week, at which he was disappointed with Mr Cameron's plans, our editor adds.Mr Johnson has also discussed his decision with Mr Gove.According to the latest opinion polls, the British public are thought to be fairly evenly split. Despite the polite promises of civilised debate, Mr Cameron is risking the unity of his party with the referendum. Cabinet ministers like Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove, finally allowed to speak out today, rushed straight from Downing Street to work the phones for one of the leave campaigns. The gang of six who posed awkwardly for photographs could well become seven when Boris Johnson breaks his continuing silence. But whatever the individual calculations, expressions of opinion on either side are dwarfed by what today's announcement finally confirms - that in 123 days British voters have the chance to choose to step away from one of the institutions that has shaped our laws, and all of our lives, for more than 40 years. Read more from LauraIn his statement, Mr Cameron warned that leaving the EU would be a ""leap in the dark"" as he urged voters to back his reform deal.""The choice is in your hands - but my recommendation is clear. I believe that Britain will be safer, stronger and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union.""Home Secretary Theresa May said the EU was far from perfect but ""for reasons of security, protection against crime and terrorism, trade with Europe, and access to markets around the world"" it was in the national interest to remain in.Read moreMr Gove said it had been the most difficult decision of his career to go against the prime minister, but he believed ""our country would be freer, fairer and better off outside the EU"". He added: ""Far from providing security in an uncertain world, the EU's policies have become a source of instability and insecurity.""Commons leader Chris Grayling, another leave campaign backer, said: ""I actually believe the EU is holding this country back. We cannot control our borders, limit the number of people who come here do trade deals.""I do not believe we can take decisions in the national interest when we are part of the European Union.""He said the prime minister had ""put in a Herculean effort to try to deliver change"" to Britain's relationship with the EU, but the ""concessions"" he had brought back from Brussels did not ""give us the opportunity to take decisions in the national interest"" without consulting Brussels.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Employment Minster Priti Patel, who is not a full cabinet member but attends meetings, have also joined the leave campaign.Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom - who is not a member of the cabinet - will also back the leave campaign.The rest of the cabinet joined Mr Cameron in the remain camp, including Business Secretary Sajid Javid - previously seen as a potential leave supporter.The UK held a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU. The vote was in favour of staying in, but there have been growing calls from the public and politicians for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years.The organisation has extended its control and now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport and consumer rights.David Cameron initially resisted calls for another vote, but in 2013 he changed his mind. At the last election he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of a public vote to decide whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU.Mr Cameron claims his EU reform deal will give Britain ""special status"" within the bloc - tackling concerns over migrants getting ""something for nothing"" from the benefit system and exempting the country from the EU drive for ""ever-closer union"".But critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration or take back powers from Brussels.UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: ""The 23rd is our golden opportunity, let battle be joined. Mr Cameron keeps on telling us that Britain would be better in a 'reformed Europe'. But he fails to point out that there is no reformed European Union on offer here. The prime minister's EU deal is pathetic."" Britain Stronger in Europe released a campaign video accusing leave campaigners of ""utter hypocrisy"" for attacking Mr Cameron's deal, claiming that many of them have been calling for the same reforms.The key points of Mr Cameron's reform deal are: The Labour Party is officially campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, although a small group of the party's backbenchers have joined the leave campaign.Leader Jeremy Corbyn voted for Britain to leave the European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, in 1975 but has since changed his mind, arguing that ""it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers"".He branded Mr Cameron's negotiations a ""sideshow"" aimed at appeasing critics in the Conservative Party and said he had missed an opportunity to protect jobs and ""stop the spread of low pay"".Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a statement the SNP will be ""leading the positive case to keep Scotland in the EU"".

Mr Jones is seeking another term in office to complete a ""decade of delivery"" that started in 2011.He said voters faced a choice between keeping him as first minister or Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies.Mr Jones, first minister since 2009, outlined the party's six key pledges for May's assembly election campaign. He also repeated a promise that Labour would not increase income taxes if the assembly gets the powers necessary.Having led the Welsh government - either alone or in coalition - for 17 years, Labour's record will come under scrutiny at the election.But Mr Jones hailed achievements in education, health and the economy under his party.Labour could not afford ""distractions"" and must keep its sights set on ""the fact that this election is a straight fight between Labour and the Tories,"" he said.""We need to be very clear in our own minds about the challenge ahead of us in May.""This will be our toughest ever assembly election campaign.""After months of infighting in Labour under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, Mr Jones said Labour needed to ""pull together, and work together, and campaign together"".Welsh Labour chairman Andy Richards said he has had ""fierce words"" with party colleagues to maintain discipline.Reacting for the Welsh Conservatives, Mr Davies said: ""Carwyn Jones's term in office can only be categorised as an abject failure and he would've been sacked years ago if he worked for a private sector firm."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn told the conference Welsh Labour had made a ""massive difference"" during its 17 years in power.He said Wales enjoyed good industrial relations, where ministers had not ""picked a fight"" with junior doctors who had gone on strike in England over new contracts.    Jeremy Corbyn got the de rigueur standing ovation for a conference speech that credited the Welsh government as an ""inspiration"" to Labour in the rest of Britain.And if any party members are not thrilled by his leadership, the message to them is clear: Bite your tongues, at least until after May's election.Welsh Labour chairman Andy Richards said he had been exchanging some ""fierce words"" with party colleagues (in private) about the need for discipline and unity in the run-up to the election.In his speech, Carwyn Jones said Labour needed to ""pull together"" to win.That message has particular resonance for Labour after the damaging rows that have gripped the party since Mr Corbyn was elected leader.

The prime minister made his announcement on the date for the referendum in Downing Street after briefing his cabinet.It came after he said late on Friday night that he had secured a deal with EU leaders which would give the UK ""special status"".Scotland's first minister said she believed Mr Cameron had been negotiating on ""very narrow grounds"" and it was now time to hear the ""big picture, positive case"" for remaining in the EU.However, Ms Sturgeon said she was concerned about the clash between the June referendum date and the Holyrood elections which will be held on Thursday 5 May.She said: ""I still think it is the wrong date, not just because of the overlap with the Scottish Parliament elections but also because I think we do need time to have that big, positive debate that I have been talking about. ""But that, in a sense, has passed. The date has been named so it's time to get on with it.""Scottish Labour leader Ms Dugdale said that, now the package of reforms had been agreed and a date set, ""those of us who back staying in the EU must get on and make the positive case for that"". She added: ""Labour is Scotland's internationalist party. We believe working in solidarity with other nations makes us stronger. We will be enthusiastic leaders of this campaign.""Ms Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said: ""Whether you are a natural supporter of the EU or prefer Britain to leave, if you are under 58, you've never been offered the chance to give your opinion at the ballot box.""It's right to have this referendum so everyone's voice is heard.""She added: ""For my own part, I believe that - on balance - Scotland's businesses do better from being part of the biggest free trade bloc in the world, and I hope the country chooses to remain.""For the Liberal Democrats, leader Mr Rennie said: ""With open markets, partnership between universities and free movement of people it is in our interest to remain a key part of the European Union.""Our ancestors who experienced a continent of conflict for centuries will be looking on with incredulity that we are even considering leaving the organisation that has helped create a continent of peace.""Speaking on the BBC News Channel, UKIP's Scottish leader Mr Coburn said: ""I would like to see powers brought back to Edinburgh. ""If we get out of the European Union, powers will be repatriated to Scotland on fishing, on agriculture, on many other things. ""If we get a Brexit I can be very confident in saying Scotland will get a lot more powers returned here.""Ross Greer, Scottish Green Party spokesman on Europe, said the need to put forward a vision on a European Union ""based on solidarity and the common good"" was ""more urgent than ever"".As the date for the referendum was announced, campaigning was already getting under way in Scotland.Scotland Stronger In Europe - the Scottish arm of Britain Stronger In Europe - erected a street stall in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street on Saturday morning. Campaign spokesman John Edward said: ""Scottish votes could be crucial in keeping the UK in Europe, so it is important that Scotland comes together and chooses a future in Europe.""There is strong support in Scotland to stay in the EU, and we want to motivate people with positive campaigning to turn out and vote for 'Remain' on June 23.""In Edinburgh, Nigel Griffiths of the Labour Leave campaign was handing out leaflets.He said: ""Every day £50m is going from the Treasury to Brussels. Only half of that comes back, in fact less, and we don't get a say in how that's spent - Brussels dictates that to us - and it's time to reclaim that.""Here in Scotland we need a Scottish government to stand up against Brussels and fight for our steel workers and steel indusrty, our farming industry and our fishing industry, and sadly they are not doing that."""
2016-02-21,Lib Dem defeat blamed on 'perfect storm',https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35615285,"The Liberal Democrats' general election defeat was the result of a ""perfect storm"" including the tuition fees U-turn, a loss of activists, a weak Labour Party and an effective Tory strategy, a party review has concluded.The Lib Dems went from 57 MPs in 2010 to eight in May, triggering the resignation of leader Nick Clegg.The party's election review said its move into coalition with the Tories had not been ""well understood"".It also blamed a ""confusing"" campaign.After the Lib Dems joined the Tory-led coalition in 2010, Mr Clegg was made deputy prime minister, with several high-profile ministerial roles taken by Lib Dems.The review said Lib Dem members agreed the party was right to join the coalition ""in the national interest"" but said it had ""singularly failed at using our new position to garner support, retain and communicate our vision, or maintain a unique offer"".Ditching the party's key pledge to scrap tuition fees ""significantly damaged"" the Lib Dems' reputation and credibility, the review concluded, saying it was ""almost incomprehensible"" that 27 MPs voted in favour of an increase despite the ""carefully-negotiated"" coalition agreement allowing them to abstain.Other factors blamed for the loss of support were a lack of financial resources and campaigns with differing messages in different parts of the country as well as ""ageing members and deflated morale"" among activists.""For some MPs, local leadership took a back seat to the demands of Westminster,"" it added.When it came to the general election, the review said no party had a response to the Tories' message warning of a Labour alliance with the SNP, and criticised the Lib Dems' ""fast-changing, complicated messages"".The review -  carried out by members of the party's Campaigns and Communications Committee - made a string of recommendations to help the party fare better in any future coalition.These include that Lib Dems should make it clear they will only automatically vote for legislation covered by the coalition agreement, and that the ""wider party"" should be represented in the negotiations.Tim Farron, who replaced Mr Clegg as leader, said: ""Blame and criticism can provide short term satisfaction, but do nothing for a future vision.""This report is about setting a way forward, recognising the mistakes we made, and learning from them."""
2016-02-21,EU deal gives UK special status - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35616768,"David Cameron says a deal struck with EU leaders will give the UK ""special status"" and he will campaign with his ""heart and soul"" to stay in the union.The agreement, reached late on Friday after two days of talks in Brussels, gives the UK power to limit some EU migrants' benefits.It also includes a treaty change so the UK is not bound to ""ever closer union"" with other EU member states, he said.EU exit campaigners said the ""hollow"" deal offered only ""very minor changes"".Mr Cameron is set to the announce the date of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU after a cabinet meeting which is happening at 10:00 GMT - the referendum is widely expected to be on Thursday, 23 June.Once the date is announced, ministers will be allowed to campaign for whichever side they want - one of Mr Cameron's closest political allies Michael Gove has already been named as supporting the Leave camp. Others, such as Iain Duncan Smith are expected to follow - but a question mark remains over which way London Mayor Boris Johnson will jump. The key points of the deal are: The prime minster had to make concessions to get a deal with the leaders of the 27 other EU members.Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals,  Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.The agreement on renegotiating the UK's EU membership was announced by European Council president Donald Tusk, who tweeted: ""Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for #UKinEU.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted the package of reforms would ""elicit support in the UK for the country to remain in the EU"".Mr Tusk said it ""strengthens Britain's special status"", while EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described it as ""fair"".Mr Tusk added: ""We didn't walk away from the negotiating table. We were willing to sacrifice part of our interests for the common good, to show our unity.""I deeply believe the UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people.""The ink is hardly dry on the UK's EU deal, but immediately the focus has switched to the substance of what David Cameron has achieved and - possibly an awkward question - how many of his colleagues will argue against him.The focus will move to whether the prime minister can keep his party politely together during a period of public disagreement.The ability to restrict benefits to migrants is an important victory for Mr Cameron - ammunition for his argument that he has achieved changes to help reduce the number of EU migrants coming to live and work in the UK.The proposals are complicated and do not exactly match the promises he made in the Conservative Party manifesto.But with it - and the other commitments - it becomes harder for his critics to make the case that the agreement is flimsy and will change nothing.Read more from LauraMr Cameron said he had achieved the reforms he wanted, claiming they would put the UK ""in the driving seat"" of one of the world's biggest markets and create a ""more flexible"" EU.""We have permanently protected the pound and our right to keep it,"" he added, saying that, for the first time, the EU ""has explicitly acknowledged it has more than one currency"".The prime minister said he had also protected Britain from further political integration inside the EU, adding: ""Let me put this as simply as I can: Britain will never be part of a European superstate.""Outlining his case to remain ""in a reformed Europe"", Mr Cameron said ""turning our back on the EU is no solution at all"". ""We should be suspicious of those who claim that leaving Europe is an automatic fast-track to a land of milk and honey,"" he added.""The British people must now decide whether to stay in this reformed European Union or to leave. This will be a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mr Cameron's deal as a ""sideshow"" designed to ""appease his opponents in the Conservative Party,"" adding that he had done nothing to protect jobs and fight low pay. ""We will be campaigning to keep Britain in Europe in the coming referendum, regardless of David Cameron's tinkering, because it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers,"" he said.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now ""more important than ever"" that those who supported Scotland's continued EU membership made the case ""as strongly as possible"".Eurosceptics have dismissed the reforms, saying they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or reduce migration.Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said Mr Cameron ""will now declare victory but it is an entirely hollow one"".UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""This is a truly pathetic deal. Let's Leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing £55m every day to Brussels. I believe in Britain. We are good enough to be an independent, self-governing nation outside of the EU. This is our golden opportunity.""As the EU summit was being concluded, another EU exit campaign, Grassroots Out, held a rally in Westminster.Conservative MP David Davis said it was time for Britain ""to take  control of its own destiny"", while UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the cross-party campaign was ""absolutely united in fighting to get back our democracy"".Mr Farage unveiled former Respect MP George Galloway as a ""special guest"" at the rally, describing him as a ""towering figure on the left of British politics"".What are your views on the deal and the UK's place in the EU?

2016-02-21,Swinney: 'Progress made' in fiscal talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35608132,"The UK and Scottish governments have made ""some progress"" in talks to establish a fiscal framework for new devolved powers, but are yet to finalise a deal.Finance Secretary John Swinney and his Treasury counterpart Greg Hands met for talks for the tenth time in London.Mr Swinney said progress had been made on a number of issues, but said there was not yet an ""overall agreement"".Mr Hands said the talks would now continue into the weekend.Both sides are expected to lay out their positions to MSPs on Tuesday.It was hoped a deal could be struck before representatives of the UK and Scottish governments are due to appear at Holyrood to give evidence about the deal, which will establish a financial basis for new powers to be devolved as part of the Scotland Bill.No ""overall agreement"" was reached, but both sides said progress had been made during Friday's talks, with chancellor George Osborne involved for the first time.BBC Scotland understands Mr Osborne also spoke to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon about details of the deal.Still no deal, but optimism from both sides.John Swinney says there has been progress; Scottish Secretary David Mundell says the same.There are still issues which need to be resolved. The Scottish government says they are significant.But the involvement of the chancellor in the talks for the first time is seen by both governments as a sign of how seriously the UK side is taking the negotiations.As the EU talks in Brussels show, nothing is guaranteed. But for the first time in weeks, there's a glimmer of hope. While describing the talks as ""productive"", Mr Swinney said there were ""significant issues"" still to be resolved.He said: ""We have not managed to reach an overall agreement today, but we have made progress on a number of issues that are relevant to the agreement.""We don't have a lot of time on our side because the parliamentary scrutiny of the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework is due to commence in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, so it is important that we work with all speed to try to resolve the outstanding significant issues.""We are committed to resolving those issues and to working with the UK government to enable that, and we will concentrate on that work in the course of the next few days to try to resolve these outstanding questions.""Mr Hands said there had been a ""step forward"" in the negotiations, with ""progress being made in a number of important areas"".He said: ""The UK government is absolutely committed to implementing the Smith agreement in full and willing to go the extra mile in order to secure an agreement.""We've agreed that UK and Scottish government officials will continue discussions over the weekend and I remain confident that a deal can be reached that is fair to Scotland and fair to the rest of the UK, now and in the future.""Ms Sturgeon has previously written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter.The prime minister has said that ""no one is keener"" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to ""move towards"" his position.Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has written to Ms Sturgeon urging the Scottish government to stay at the negotiating table, saying the talks should be extended until Holyrood breaks up on 24 March if a deal is not struck next week.Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month.Holyrood's devolution committee said there would be ""very substantial impacts"" on Holyrood's ability to scrutinise the deal if matters were delayed beyond Friday, and called for a ""full explanation"" of arguments by its next meeting on 23 February.The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the ""no detriment"" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland.This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement, but the negotiating teams differ in their interpretations of this. The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an ""almost £3bn cut"", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is ""not logical"" and ""not fair"" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK.The key issue concerns population growth. With Scotland's population forecast to grow more slowly than that of the UK as a whole in coming years, the two sides differ on how Scotland's block grant should be altered to cushion against the economic impact of this.Mr Swinney said the talks had been ""productive"" in some other areas.He said: ""We have managed to resolve a number of the issues that were involved because the fiscal framework has been about a range of different issues, not just about the principle of no detriment in the block grant adjustment.""So some progress has been made, but we have outstanding questions, significant questions, that have yet to be resolved.""There are very significant powers that are being transferred to the Scottish Parliament. So we are energetic and enthusiastic about securing those powers and being able to exercise those powers, but we have said all along we can only do that if we have a fair fiscal framework in place."""
2016-02-21,Thatcher government's 'rural rioters' probe,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35610073,"Research into ""drunken mob violence"" in the ""shires"" was ordered by the Thatcher government, previously unseen Cabinet Office files have revealed.Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told police to investigate the problem of the ""rural rioter"", noting similarities with the ""football hooligan"".In a memorandum from June 1988, Mr Hurd said police saw violent offences in rural areas as an ""increasing burden"".The files were released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, In the memorandum, Mr Hurd noted there had been 83,000 violent offences in county and rural areas the year before - half as many again as in 1980 - and he said he was ""concerned that the problem is getting worse"".""Many of the 16 to 25-year-olds involved in these disturbances have a latent capacity for violence,"" he said.""Toughness is a proof of manhood. Drink removes their inhibitions and pushes them over the edge.""Mr Hurd dismissed the idea of having a ""rural riot squad"" to react to spontaneous disorder, saying: ""They would spend their time chasing from one end of the county to another.""Instead he proposed tougher licensing laws, quick prosecutions and exemplary sentences, and improved policing procedures.The newly-released documents also show that Margaret Thatcher's advisers urged the prime minister to force a showdown with her Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, telling him to accept her authority or quit, over the Westland affair in 1986.Mr Heseltine was backing a European consortium in its battle with the US aircraft manufacturer Sikorsky to take over British aircraft manufacturer Westland, even though the government was supposed to be neutral.Other documents show Mrs Thatcher refused to bail out the 1986 Commonwealth Games despite being asked to contribute £1m by media tycoon Robert Maxwell.And Mrs Thatcher was warned repeatedly by ministers that introducing the Poll Tax - a flat rate ""community charge"" to replace domestic rates based on property values - would be a political disaster.Welsh Secretary Peter Walker was among those to speak out, warning that a proposal to exempt rough sleepers could lead to people sleeping on the streets to avoid the charge.""While I appreciate that in practice it is highly unlikely that local authorities would be able either to track down people who sleep rough or to get any payment of the charge from them, a specific exemption could be seen as encouraging them to sleep on the street rather than in a hostel,"" he said.Widespread protests against the new tax in 1989 were seen as one of the reasons why Mrs Thatcher was forced out of Number 10 the following year."
2016-02-21,Sugar tax 'would cut future obesity',https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35604314,"A 20% tax on sugary drinks in the UK would prevent 3.7 million people becoming obese over the next decade, a report predicts.Cancer Research UK and the UK Health Forum worked out the likely impact of the tax on eating habits and, ultimately, the nation's waistlines.Their report said such a tax would also save the NHS £10m a year by 2025.The government is considering the measure, but soft drinks companies say other options would be more effective.People get between 12% and 15% of their energy from sugar, but official recommendations say it should be less than 5%.The statisticians modelled the impact of the tax and predicted a 16% reduction in the number of cans of pop consumed.Their figures were then adjusted to account for the food and drink people might turn to instead.They concluded a tax would lead to people consuming on average 15 fewer calories per day.While the difference sounds tiny, the model predicts a large impact on waistlines.Currently, 29% of people are obese and trends suggest that figure will reach 34% in 2025.Rather than reverse the obesity epidemic, the forecast predicts the tax would lead to obesity rates levelling off at around 29% - preventing 3.7 million people from becoming obese.Alison Cox, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""The ripple effect of a small tax on sugary drinks is enormous. ""These numbers make it clear why we need to act now before obesity becomes an even greater problem.""And Jane Landon, from the UK Health Forum, argued: ""Countries which have introduced a tax on sugary drinks have not only reduced consumption, they have raised much-needed revenues for public health measures.""The report has come out as the government is preparing its obesity strategy, which is due in the next few weeks.Prime Minister David Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have indicated all options are on the table, including a sugar tax.A report by Public Health England said a sugary drinks tax would cut sugar consumption ""at least in the short term"".And TV chef Jamie Oliver has campaigned for the tax saying it was the ""single most important"" change that could be made.The director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, said: ""The hypothetical claims made in this modelling study run contrary to real-world evidence. ""In fact, the soft drinks tax in Mexico has reduced average calorie intake by six calories per person per day, with no evidence that it has reduced levels of obesity.""He added that other options such as reducing portion sizes or changing ingredients would be more effective.Follow James on Twitter.Why is sugar so addictive?Michael Mosley on how much sugar is in foodCan we trust industry?"

2016-02-21,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria. Shadow young people and voter registration minister - Gloria De PieroThe former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election.

2016-02-21,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-21,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders, say anti-EU campaigners. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-21,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday, 23 June.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The original 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no"". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo (the current state of affairs) and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Downing Street and MPs have accepted the amended wording. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal.Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups.  Read more about them.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign -  A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaignLeave.EU - Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, with the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups - it has been vying for months for official designation with Vote Leave.Grassroots Out - A new outfit which emerged at the start of 2016 following in-fighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey. The watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. By law, the watchdog does not have to choose a lead campaigner for either side if it thinks none of the groups make the grade, although this would be a highly unusual and controversial move.There are a string of other organisations campaigning either for or against EU membership, as well as groups of MPs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is certain to play a prominent role in the leave campaign, regardless of which leave campaign gets the official designation. David Cameron has vowed to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU ""with all my heart and soul"", and is likely to take part in any TV debates which take place. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is leading Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but says he will not share a platform with David Cameron."
2016-02-21,Balanced deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35620821,"David Cameron will now begin the campaign that will define his legacy and his time in office. The battleground for the next four months has been laid out. The prime minister and the ""in"" campaign will insist that the UK's relationship with the EU has been fundamentally changed, with several key demands met.But those who want to leave the UK say it is a ""hollow deal"", that the negotiations were weak in their ambition and Britain has not regained control over its laws or its borders. They question whether the emergency brake on migrant benefits will have any impact on immigration numbers - and point out that the legislation on this will have to be passed by the European Parliament only AFTER Britain has voted in a referendum. And the critics whose ambition is to see powers being returned to Westminster will also point out that the UK has not regained the right to over-rule EU laws. So that is the battleground at home but Mr Cameron had also claimed there ""was a big prize for everyone in the room"" in fundamentally reforming the EU. But the other member states did not choose to seize this moment to embrace wider reforms, underscoring that Britain remains exceptional, the outsider.The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the settlement addressed all of the Prime Minister's concerns ""without compromising our fundamental values"". For the rest of the EU that was crucial. There was the will to help David Cameron but the other leaders were not prepared to weaken the EU's core beliefs.Freedom of movement has not been compromised. The march towards deeper integration has not been slowed. The President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be ""no power of veto over the eurozone"" - not that Britain was seeking that. What the French wanted to underline was that Britain would not win any ""exceptions to the rules of the EU"" - particularly in relation to regulation in the City.Even so some European leaders are uncomfortable. This deal recognises that there are different layers of integration. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said: ""There is a risk of us losing sight of the original European dream.""  Belgium was greatly exercised that other countries might want to opt out from further integration. There is an underlying fear of contagion that other countries might seek similar opt-outs, so leading to an unravelling of the EU. In the end, the political battle will almost certainly not be fought on the details of this deal. It will be fought over the economic risks of leaving the EU and whether the UK can regain control over its laws and borders."
2016-02-21,Risking it all,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35599680,"It gets cold, very very cold, waiting at the entrance of the European Council building in Brussels. You can spend several hours being jostled by French camera crews, squashed by Italian snappers, or shoved unceremoniously out of the way by any one of 27 other countries' journalists as the leaders of the European Union arrive one by one, and we frantically try to grab a word with them as they rush past. There'll be sharp elbows in the press pen, craning of necks and stretching of microphones, as David Cameron arrives at this summit, which could define not just his leadership, but the future of his party and his country's place in the world. But how on earth did the man who once accused the Conservatives of being out of touch for ""banging on about Europe"", get himself into a position where he has already been ""banging on about Europe"" for months and months, and will spend the next four months still doing precisely that? Since he made that claim in his first season as party leader in 2006, appearing in front of a huge video screen tastefully projected with a giant tree, there have been three big changes, linked, that have got him to this juncture, which of course ultimately is a product of his own political calculation.Most simply, as the years have passed, his party has changed. Since the Maastricht rebels failed to get a public vote in 1993 on the treaty that created the modern version of the European Union, there has been a rump of Conservatives deeply passionate about the cause, significantly concerned that the EU's laws, not Britain's own, are more important - the question of sovereignty that's a big part of the current talks. But their concerns, while shared by many Conservative Party members, were not considered mainstream in the parliamentary party - balanced, if not squeezed out, by heavyweight Europhile voices. But as the EU expanded, and generations of MPs came and went, a soft scepticism towards the European project, neither full-throated support, nor hardcore opposition, became more common, and sympathy for the idea of a referendum spread from the margins. The eurozone financial crisis, and the EU's stumbling approach to sorting it out, gave a fresh energy to eurosceptic MPs who wanted to campaign to leave.  In part that apathy, if not downright dislike, towards the EU spread because of the enormous rise in the numbers of people from around the Union who came to live and work in the UK. Numbers that took the political establishment completely by surprise began to arrive from the moment new countries like Poland joined the EU in 2004. There is a complicated, and emotional debate about the impact of the numbers, but few can dispute that the effect has been very significant in some parts of the country, with figures this week showing the numbers still rising, standing at more than two million now. For many people, that very visible impact of our membership of the EU has given them pause for thought.And it was that steep rise in EU immigration that gave David Cameron his most pressing political reason for - in the end - promising a referendum. UKIP's appeal grew alongside the rise in immigration. By 2012, they were greedily nibbling at the Conservative vote with a record performance in the local elections and a leader who in some moments seemed to appeal to swathes of the public for his plain speaking, in a style that also alienated many others. A drive to address the threat from UKIP and satisfy growing internal demands for the promise of a referendum led eventually to Mr Cameron's commitment in the 2013 speech to give the public a vote on whether to stay or go. It's worth remembering that, perhaps strangely, the 2013 speech in which he made his promise to hold a vote made no mention of immigration. But add a general election and increasing public concern to the mix and three years later, his hopes of limiting benefits for migrants are the centrepiece of his renegotiation. The prime minister is not a politician who is known for getting hung up on the past, his seemingly bomb-proof - if maybe sometimes misplaced - confidence in his own abilities tends to lead him to look forward. He is not a prisoner of his record. But as he arrives in Brussels on Thursday, and gets out of the shiny black limousine to sweep past the journalists clamouring to ask a question, will he consider even, for a moment, the irony that he may be risking it all for something he once more or less dismissed as a fringe concern?"
2016-02-21,Why it's all about you,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35612584,"It's not about him. Or his deal. Or what he did or did not negotiate in the middle of the night.And it's not about them. Or what they say. Or what they think of what he did or did not achieve.No, this is now all about you. And your country. And what you will decide.That's because after all the talk about the prime minister's haggling in Brussels, you now have a say just as big as he does on one of the most important questions the country has ever faced - should we stay or go, should we be in or out, should we remain or leave the European Union?The British people will now get to make that choice in what many have demanded for so long - a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union, which will be held on Thursday 23 June.If you're under 58 years old, it's a choice you've never had.If you're older than that, you had the chance to vote in a referendum in 1975 on our membership of what was then known as the Common Market, or EEC, but you may feel - as many older voters do - that the UK is now part of something very different.The next few days will be dominated by arguments about the details of the deal David Cameron has negotiated with the 27 other EU leaders. Will it cut the number of people moving here from Europe? Will it protect British business from decisions taken by and in the interests of the eurozone? Will it prevent the UK from being sucked into ""ever closer union"" or what some call a federal Europe?Will it make it easier for national politicians to stop those in Brussels imposing unwanted new rules or laws? Will whatever was agreed stand up in Europe's courts and parliaments?However, the decision that you will face in four months' time will, I suspect, be dominated by more fundamental questions. Would we be richer, would we be safer, would we have more control of our own destiny, would we have more influence in the world if we chose to remain or to leave? There won't, of course, be any space on the ballot paper to say, ""I'd like to stay if only there was less interference from Brussels or bureaucracy or immigration, or if only there was more democracy"". There won't be an opportunity to say ""I'd like to leave if I could be sure the EU won't make it harder or more expensive to sell our goods, or force us to allow Europe's people to move here freely if we want our goods and services and money to move freely there"".No, the choice will be a simple, plain, black and white one - remain or leave. No ifs, no buts, no maybes. It will involve making a judgement on what the future might be like one way or another. No expert can simply tell you what you should or should not believe. I'm often told that it doesn't matter how you vote because ""they"" were all the same, all in it for themselves and nothing ever changed. You can't say that about this vote. It matters. It will make a difference. And it's not about Cameron, or Boris's or Corbyn's future. It is about you and yours and your country's.

2016-02-21,Business partners,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35615027,"Britain and the Republic of Ireland were once historical adversaries but now are close trading neighbours.The Irish government wants Britain to remain in the EU fearing that uncertainty over what might happen to relations with one of its biggest trading partners could have a big impact on the Irish economy just recovering from a deep recession. Ronnie Ritchie runs one of Ireland's oldest sweet-makers, HG Ritchie in Dublin. The traditional manufacturing methods could remind you of Willie Wonka's chocolate factory, with vast piles of the sweets of an Irish childhood everywhere. But the stuff that makes them sweet - sugar - comes from Britain.""Our biggest worry about the British leaving the EU would be our supply of sugar,"" he says.His business mirrors Ireland generally, with significant trade across the Irish Sea, in both directions. A mini-mountain of bagged coloured sweets is destined for Scotland where the retro sweets unknown to Ritchie's connoisseurs in Ireland have a loyal following.  ""They're a product called Oddfellows, they were made in King's of Wishaw. When that factory closed down we took over the manufacturing here. ""We've exported to a factory called James Ross's of Edinburgh since then and continue to do so. It's a big, big line in Scotland and important to our trade.""""It's a case of suck it and see,"" he jokes of the UK leaving the EU, but says it's a worry. ""Our main concern here is the possibility of inconsistencies of supply should the barriers go up. No-one likes not knowing what's coming next."" ""Are we going to have to go through customs to bring products through again - or are we going to have to dodge England and go around to Europe?""That's only going to increase our costs, and for an island manufacturer that's really impossible in the current climate.""Ireland will shortly remember 50 years since Irish militants blew up Nelson's Pillar in Dublin, which was similar to the column in Trafalgar Square. But relations today could not be more different, and are closer than ever since political peace was forged in Northern Ireland in 1998.Near where Nelson once stood, a branch of Ann Summers, the UK-based lingerie and sex toys chain, now fights for business opposite where the Irish rebels fought in the GPO in 1916 on O'Connell Street. Trade between Ireland and Britain has soared since 1998: one-third of Irish imports come from the UK, which is where one-sixth of Irish exports are sold in a two-way trade worth around €1bn (£775m) a week. IBEC, which represents Ireland's employers, wants the UK to stay in the EU. But while the UK is a trade partner for Ireland it is also a major competitor - vying to woo investment from big US and international companies, which Ireland has attracted - helped by low corporation tax. IBEC fears that Brexit could free British business from EU regulations and laws, and chief executive Danny McCoy believes it could give the UK competitive advantage in the battle for inward investment. ""The fact that Britain would have more flexibilities potentially around issues like state-aid rules, the labour market or European Court of Justice decisions - all of these things could be quite game-changing in the competitive position of Ireland versus Britain. ""So I think that for Irish business, by far the best outcome for the referendum is Britain staying in Europe.""He accepts that that could be construed by some in Britain as an argument for leaving the EU - which he opposes.""Absolutely, it could well be - but there's much more dimension to the European decision than just the business dimension or the investment decision. ""Access to the single market is going to be crucial for British businesses but also, more widely, security concerns and a whole raft of other European interactivity.""IBEC says an EU without Britain would also see the loss of a huge player, which it argues would be bad for Europe. ""Britain will be the largest EU economy in our lifetime. With current projections for population, Britain will exceed Germany,"" he says.Dublin today feels a much more European city than in the days Lord Nelson towered over its skyline with EU enlargement bringing many new nationalities to live in the city. Continental influences like cafes and culture are everywhere, but in trade too, with around 45% of Irish exports going to continental EU, almost three times as much as go to the UK.Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) make up around 98% of Irish companies and provide over 70% of private sector jobs. Britain is still important for these firms which are the backbone of Ireland's economy, says Mark Fielding, chief executive of ISME which represents over 10,000 firms. He believes that while Britain leaving the EU would be significant it would not be a disaster because many Irish firms have found new markets during the recent recession.""Because there was a recession in the UK as well, many SMEs had to find other markets.""We found that many of our member companies were exporting into the EU - France, Germany and further afield - rather than looking at the old reliable, the UK.""Perhaps Ireland's best-known commercial economist is Robbie Kelleher of financial services group Davy. Once a top Gaelic footballer for Dublin in the 1970s, he's not lost his knack for keeping an eye on the sporting odds which he says are against Brexit - a British exit from the EU. Whatever the outcome, he believes business will adapt. ""Currently the polls are putting it about 50-50 that they'll stay in or go out. ""The bookies who usually know a little bit more about these things than others are actually quoting 3/1-on that they are going to stay in - so it (Brexit) may not happen, and my own instinct is that it won't happen.""The spectre of customs controls along the Northern Ireland border or restrictions on trade between here and Britain is far-fetched and highly unlikely.""  In Dublin's pubs, the political talk is all about Ireland's general election but with more murmurs about a UK exit too. Some see it like the Y2K millennium bug or a lot of fuss about nothing - but others fear the unknown. Whatever the outcome Irish business will be hoping there'll be no big hangover afterwards. "
2016-02-21,Summit to eat?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35615291,"It has been billed as the crunch summit where David Cameron battles to secure agreement for his EU reforms.But as the talks have dragged on, a sub-plot has kept waiting press entertained, with a succession of ""English"" meals dangled before the 28 leaders - only to be whisked away as negotiations extend longer than planned. First up:This was how aides to European Council president Donald Tusk billed what were to be Friday morning's triumphant talks sealing the deal. Had it been called an ""all-day breakfast"" they would have been covered. But the 8am fry-up was touted as the key to reaching a deal if there was no agreement on Thursday night.With ""no real progress"" made, it was pushed back to 11am, giving it more of an air of a brunch. As it happened though, the bilateral talks carried on.As announced by European Council president Donald Tusk's spokesman, it was then put back to 14:00, before going the way of the breakfast and the brunch.Or, as an EU spokesman put it, ""late English lunch"". With Europe's leaders still at loggerheads, tired and surely starving, would a plate of sandwiches and scones help bridge the gap? It was meant to take place at 15:30 Brussels time, 7.5 hours after the promised breakfast.But the scones never materialised.No sign of a deal, and no sign of that meal, as the breakfast/brunch/lunch morphed into an ""English dinner"" - with the time to be confirmed:The ""English"" tag attached to each meal did not go unnoticed, as some wondered why other parts of the UK were not contributing.Speculation raged as to what the dinner could consist of:We might find out, with an EU source suggesting a ""good chance"" of a deal over dinner. But German chancellor Angela Merkel was taking no chances as she popped out for a bag of chips.She might need the extra sustenance, as leaders have been told to book a hotel room for an extra night - so they could be contemplating that English breakfast all over again."
2016-02-21,Seeking to avoid Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20160222020725/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35620434,"Reino Unido, Grossbritannien, Storbritannien, Grande-Bretagne - whichever corner of this overcrowded, shouty press centre you stumbled through the last couple of days at this European summit you heard ""Great Britain"" being reported on - loudly and with lots of gesticulating hand movements in a multitude of European languages.Britain has done it again. It paraded itself on the EU stage as being more equal than the other equals in a union of 28. In the past, the UK has managed to negotiate a rebate from the EU budget, exempted itself from joining the euro and has arranged quite a number of opt-outs on EU legislation.A ""special status agreement"" is how the summit host, European Council President Donald Tusk, described the UK-EU reform package negotiated late on Friday by David Cameron. He got special treatment too. Tradition dictates that the first post-summit press conference is held by Mr Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission.It is usually followed by a mass cacophony of EU leaders' pressers all taking place more or less at the same time. On Friday though, Mr Cameron was allowed to preside over the podium alone for a full 20 minutes, elaborating on and crowing over his deal, speaking of the EU largely as an enrichment tool for Britons. A body the UK could benefit from or ignore depending on its usefulness. ""The best of both worlds,"" he said.Follow reaction to the Brussels dealHis European peers - who have spent weeks and months on these negotiations for Britain - must have been biting their tongue - hard - when they heard his tone. I saw a number of colleagues in this most European of press rooms bristle.Gone was the shuttle diplomacy of David Cameron, who invested so many air miles charming, listening to and selling his reform plan to other EU leaders. In his place was a British conservative prime minister gearing up for a divisive referendum at home on EU membership.""I do not love Brussels. I love Britain,"" avowed David Cameron.""When it comes to Europe, mine is a hard-headed assessment of what is in our national interest."" But then the other EU leaders acted in their national interest too. Their hard-headed decision was that it's better for them if the UK stays in the EU.""If GB goes, the rest of us have nothing,"" Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas told me.In the meantime, he and the others put on semi-theatrics for their voters around protecting their rights against David Cameron's reforms. Central and Eastern Europeans pushed back against cutting EU migrant benefits. France bared its teeth over safeguards for the City of London from eurozone legislation.But in the end, they pretty much gave David Cameron what he wanted. A decent deal on narrow but key issues.Not the fundamental change in EU-UK relations he had initially promised but enough, he hopes, to encourage the majority of his party and the British public to vote ""Yes"" to staying in the EU come referendum time. Dalia Grybauskaite , Lithuania's outspoken president, became the media darling at this summit, winning hack hearts and minds when she predicted from the first moment that: ""Everyone will have their own drama. And then we will agree.""And so it was.And now the leaders of the EU institutions - the Commission, European Parliament and Council who clearly enjoyed being the focus of and lead-story trigger for the hungry-for-any-details British press during the negotiations - will have to endure returning to relative UK obscurity once again.As the UK media now turns its sights to Westminster and the referendum itself."

On Monday, PM David Cameron told MPs leaving the union would hurt working people in the UK ""for years to come"".Chairmen or chief executives of 36 FTSE 100 companies signed the letter backing the campaign to remain in the EU.The FTSE bosses were among a total of 198 signatories from the business world, including the chief executives of Heathrow and Gatwick airports.The letter said the PM had secured a commitment from the EU ""to reduce the burden of regulation, deepen the single market and to sign-off crucial international trade deals"".They wrote: ""Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs.""""Britain will be strong, safer and better off remaining a member of the EU,"" they added.Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave.EU - which is campaigning to leave - said Downing Street had admitted using taxpayers' money and ""applying pressure"" on FTSE chairmen and chief executives to sign the letter.""The truth is that despite the bullying of a prime minister who has no real business experience, it is other normal commercial factors which will determine the continued success of British businesses to invest and grow. ""Brexit will reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and cost on business, which can be used to invest in more jobs, not less,"" he added.BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed said two leaders of US firm Goldman Sachs in Europe had also signed the letter, which he said signalled ""wider concern among major American banks based in London about the risks of leaving the EU"".But he said Brexit campaigners claimed smaller businesses were ""much more sceptical"" about the advantages of staying in the EU.He added that there were some notable absences from the letter - such as bosses of FTSE 100 firms including Tesco, RBS and Barclays.Meanwhile, Labour's former home secretary Alan Johnson is due to warn that leaving the EU could put up to 50,000 UK manufacturing apprenticeships at risk.In a speech later, he will outline Labour's case for remaining in the 28-state union, saying two thirds of British jobs in manufacturing depend on demand from Europe.Senior figures from both sides of the debate will also continue to campaign ahead of the vote - due to be held on 23 June.Mr Cameron will visit a firm in Berkshire, while the chairman of Vote Leave, Lord Lawson, is due to make a speech at Chatham House.Divisions in the Conservative Party over the referendum were laid bare during a debate in Parliament on Monday. More than 100 Conservative MPs want to leave the EU - including five full cabinet ministers and Mayor of London Boris Johnson.Putting his case for staying in the EU to MPs, Mr Cameron said the choice was between an ""even greater Britain"", or a ""leap into the dark"".However, a succession of Tory MPs questioned the substance of the PM's agreement with EU leaders - announced on Friday.Mr Johnson asked how the deal negotiated would ""in any way"" return sovereignty to the UK. The prime minister defended the deal - outlined in a new government document - telling MPs it would give the UK a ""special status"" within the EU and ensure it never became part of a European super-state.But Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said the EU was a ""failed"" body and the UK should ""make our own path"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party could make a ""real"" argument for the benefits of EU membership.According to BBC research, 142 Tory MPs will campaign to remain in the EU, 120 to leave, while 68 have yet to make their positions clear.The overwhelming majority of Labour MPs back continued EU membership as do the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats but the Democratic Unionists and UKIP are opposed.

2016-02-22,Pound hit by uncertainty over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35628733,"The pound hit its lowest level against the dollar in almost seven years on concerns about a possible UK exit from the European Union.At one stage it was down as much as 2.4% at $1.4058, its lowest level since March 2009, before later recovering.The move follows London Mayor Boris Johnson joining the campaign to leave the EU after Prime Minister David Cameron set a June referendum date. The steep fall adds to losses made by the pound over recent months.At 16:00 GMT the pound was trading at $1.4135, down 1.4% from the previous close.So far this year, fears of a British exit from the EU - dubbed 'Brexit' - have already pushed the pound down by more than 4% against the US dollar.Analysts said that was likely to continue to direct sentiment until the vote.""Today's weakness appears to reflect an increased probability of Brexit after political reaction to the new deal on EU membership was more split than the PM would have hoped,"" said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets.If the pound finishes at its lows for the day, it will be the biggest one-day loss since the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5% in 2009 and started its economic stimulus programme known as quantitative easing. To an extent sterling's weedy day is down to markets ""pricing in"" the chance of Britain leaving the EU.In the short term at least, many market participants believe a ""Brexit"" would lead to a weaker currency as worries about Britain's £229bn annual trade with the EU and the possibility of new trade barriers heave into view.There are other factors at play.The dollar has had a strong recent run against the euro and the Swiss franc as well as sterling.That's down to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in December and signal that it may do again during 2016.Confidence in the US economy may not be boundless, but it is stronger than confidence in the eurozone.At the same time the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have been sending out very doveish messages on interest rate rises.Read more from Kamal here.Against the euro, the pound is down 1% to €1.2802. Against the yen, the pound has slumped to 160.075 yen, its lowest since late 2013. ""I don't think investors are saying Brexit is good or bad, but it's the uncertainty,"" said Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro.The pound has already dropped more than 17% against the dollar in the last 18 months, partly due to the outlook for UK interest rates.Whereas the US raised rates last year, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has ruled out such a rise for now.  As a result sterling is seen as less attractive for investors, continuing to fall from the $1.7165 peak seen on 1 July, 2014.A weak pound helps exporters by making British goods cheaper on international markets.It also makes the UK a better value destination for tourists.However, a weaker pound makes imports more expensive, possibly hurting consumers and businesses that rely on foreign goods.Meanwhile, ratings agency Moody's said: ""The economic costs of a decision to leave the EU would outweigh the economic benefits.""Investment would suffer due to political uncertainty and exports would decline unless a new trade deal was struck with the EU, the credit agency said.Moody's said it would consider downgrading the UK's credit rating - which affects how expensive it is for the government to borrow money - if the country voted to leave the EU.However, another credit agency Fitch said Brexit would be ""only moderately negative"" if trade deals were secured.David Cameron announced on Saturday that the EU referendum would be held on 23 June after he came back from Brussels with a renegotiation of Britain's EU membership.The intervention by Boris Johnson is being seen as a significant blow to Mr Cameron's campaign to remain in the EU.Several other senior Conservatives - including Justice Secretary Michael Gove - have already said they would join the Out campaign."

2016-02-22,Northern Powerhouse 'a leap of faith',https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35625738,"There is no guarantee that investing billions in infrastructure will help the North of England, the man leading the ""Northern Powerhouse"" project says.But former CBI chief John Cridland told the BBC that people should take a ""leap of faith"" on new roads and railways.He said he believed reducing journey times between northern cities would improve the economy.But critics say the money might be better spent on training and skills - or on transport within cities. Mr Cridland's quango Transport for the North is due to publish its first report soon. The chancellor's advisory National Infrastructure Commission also will make recommendations on Northern transport.Five issues that will shape the Northern PowerhouseThe bodies have been considering transport options such as a motorway running under the Peak District from Sheffield to Manchester, or an HS3 rail link between Leeds and Manchester.But Anne Robinson, from Friends of the Peak District, told BBC News: ""These are just pie-in-the-sky schemes. We haven't been given the slightest shred of evidence that they will do any good."" She warned that the motorway scheme - running more than 30 miles underground - would cost a fortune, as well as creating congestion in roads at either end of the tunnel and potentially disrupting the ecology of the Peaks National Park. Mr Cridland said ambitious infrastructure should be on the agenda: ""I'm not claiming there is perfect science here.""But I am convinced that after decades of under-investment, it's now time to close that investment gap - and it will lead to better travelling experiences and economic growth.  ""Transport economics can't always prove this: sometimes, like the Victorian engineers, you have to take a leap of faith.""Ms Robinson said it was foolish to take a leap of faith with billions of public money.It is likely, though, that both quangos reporting on transport in the north will concentrate their efforts on solutions which bring quick improvement for travellers - like electrifying the Leeds-Manchester route and putting on extra carriages. Another likely favourite option will be to introduce hard-shoulder running by making all of the M62 a ""smart"" motorway.The two bodies may also be anxious to keep hope alive for heroic inter-city infrastructure in the north so people have faith in the regeneration of the region.There is already a degree of cynicism about ambitious words from Westminster. One Manchester business leader disparaged the term ""Northern Powerhouse"". ""It's a bit embarrassing isn't it? Frankly it looks like a brand in search of a product,"" he told me.Mr Cridland maintains that already the Powerhouse slogan itself has created a sense of excitement and purpose.The team making key decisions on train operation in the north has been shifted from the south to Leeds, he says - and this is making planners more responsive to local needs. The big cities of the north are talking to each other, making plans, dreaming they can really breathe new life into the region, Mr Cridland says. Now, he confesses, some infrastructure has to follow.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin."
2016-02-22,Welsh Tory leader backs EU exit,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-35631207,"Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said he will be voting for Britain to leave the EU in June.""Our future will be best served as part of a looser, economic relationship with the European Union,"" he said.Meanwhile, the prime minister has warned that leaving the EU would mean poorer parts of Wales would lose out on European grants.Speaking in the House of Commons, David Cameron said EU funds had ""made a big difference"" in parts of Wales.However, Mr Davies said that before the EU referendum, voters in Wales faced ""an even bigger question"" before then at the assembly election in May.The Tories would ""not be distracted from articulating our positive vision of real change for our NHS, education and economy,"" he said.""After a great deal of consideration I have decided that I will be voting for Britain to leave the EU. It is my belief that our future will be best served as part of a looser, economic relationship with the European Union,"" Mr Davies said in a statement on Monday.""There will be almost seven weeks for Welsh politicians to articulate their positions on the European question, but before a ballot has been cast in the referendum Welsh voters face an even bigger question. ""We are a little over 70 days away from the most important Welsh assembly election in a generation and the Welsh Conservatives will not be distracted from articulating our positive vision of real change for our NHS, education and economy.""So, Andrew RT Davies has ""done a Boris"".This has potentially big implications for the assembly campaign because I find it hard to believe that Labour, and the other parties for that matter, will not try to use it against him.Carwyn Jones has already portrayed the assembly contest as coming down to a straight question of who you want as first minister: him or Andrew RT Davies.Now it is surely a matter of time before an opponent says he should not be first minister because he wants to take us out of the EU.Whatever the merits of that criticism, the point is the EU debate will then become a central part of the assembly debate as well.Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said she was ""staggered"" by Mr Davies's support for a UK exit from the EU.""His vote to leave is an affront to the hard-working farmers, small business owners and other people whose jobs depend on EU trade,"" she said.Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith claimed Mr Davies was ""happy"" to put 200,000 Welsh jobs ""at risk"".""There's now a clear choice for first minister in May: Labour's Carwyn Jones and his record of delivery, or a Tory leader prepared to gamble with Welsh jobs,"" she added.The Welsh Tory leader's declaration puts him at odds with the prime minister and with Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, who said supporters of a UK exit from the EU were offering ""confusion and vagueness"".Of the 11 Welsh Tory MPs, six have said Britain should remain, four want to leave and one was undecided.Mr Crabb said remaining in the EU was right for Welsh businesses and claimed the ""overwhelming majority"" of firms agreed.""There's a lot they don't like about the European system in the same way that there's lots they don't like about Welsh government and UK government,"" he said.""But they know that on a balance of costs and benefits, risks and opportunities, Britain and Wales are actually better off staying part of a reforming European Union.""Mr Crabb's junior Wales Office minister Alun Cairns was the sixth Welsh Conservative MP to confirm he wanted the UK to remain in the EU.Earlier on Monday, Vale of Clwyd Tory MP Dr James Davies declared on his Facebook page he wanted the UK to leave the EU, saying it was ""time to move on"".Montgomeryshire MP Glyn Davies revealed on Twitter he would seek the views of local party members before deciding which way to vote.Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have said their parties will campaign to keep the UK in the EU, while UKIP will campaign to leave.Meanwhile, speaking in the Commons on Monday, David Cameron said EU funds had ""made a big difference"" in parts of Wales.He was responding to a question from Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader, Hywel Williams, who asked, if Britain voted to leave: ""What would happen to convergence funding which has provided large amounts of money for the poorer areas of west Wales and the valleys?"" Mr Cameron told him: ""If we were to leave the EU then we wouldn't be able to get those funds which have made a big difference in parts of Wales, parts of England, for instance in Cornwall and in other parts of our country."""
2016-02-22,Leaving EU 'big gamble' for UK security,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35628051,"The UK will be taking a ""big gamble"" with its security if it votes to leave the European Union, defence secretary Michael Fallon has claimed.The ""collective weight"" of partnerships such as the EU made it easier to deal with global threats, he told the BBC.David Cameron will face MPs later as he presents his case for the UK remaining within the 28-member organisation.But Mayor of London Boris Johnson has again insisted that the country has a ""great future"" outside the EU. Mr Johnson's declaration on Sunday that he backs EU exit is being seen as a significant blow to Mr Cameron's campaign to remain in the EU.The prime minister will outline details to MPs in a Commons statement, starting at 15.30 GMT, of last week's deal with EU leaders on reforms to the terms of the UK's membership, which paved the way for him to call a referendum on EU membership on 23 June. He says the deal strengthens British sovereignty and the UK will be ""safer and stronger"" remaining in the EU.This message was echoed by Mr Fallon, who told Radio 4's Today that the UK benefited from being part of international partnerships, such as the European Union, Nato and the United Nations.He rejected claims by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, one of six Cabinet ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, that the UK's membership actually exposed it to greater security risks, pointing out that the EU had taken the lead in confronting Russia over its annexation of Crimea and Iran over its nuclear programme.""At the moment our defence and security rests on Nato, not on the EU, but the EU adds to that security...The EU can do things that Nato cannot.""""It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism...We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism. You need to be part of these big partnerships.""While he was not saying the UK could not survive outside the EU, he said it would be up to the British people to decide whether ""we are safer and stronger inside the EU or take what is a big gamble and leave to what is a rather uncertain future"".Asked about Mr Johnson's decision, Mr Fallon said the PM would have preferred ""more support"" from the Mayor of London but that his was one ""individual view"" and the overwhelming majority of the Cabinet back Mr Cameron's position.Leaving his home in north London, Mr Johnson said his immediate focus was his remaining time in City Hall and there would be plenty of time to discuss the issue of Europe, and the UK's ""great future"" outside it, over the next four months. Mr Johnson, who is also Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has said the referendum was a ""once-in-a-lifetime chance"" for voters.In a 2,000-word column for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said staying inside the union would lead to ""an erosion of democracy"".""There is only one way to get the change we need - and that is to vote to go; because all EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says no,"" he wrote.He added: ""This is a moment to be brave, to reach out - not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else.""This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule.""A vote to remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy."" Cameron to face MPs on EU referendumSeveral other senior Tories - including Justice Secretary Michael Gove - have already said they will join the Out campaign.By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondentIt is less than 48 hours since the referendum date was announced, but already the campaigning is in full swing. The leave campaign has been given a major boost by Boris Johnson, who says the only way to change the EU is to vote to go.That has been seen by some as a nod to the possibility of a second referendum if a leave vote prompted the EU to offer a new deal - something No 10 has firmly dismissed.Mr Johnson denies his stance is motivated by party leadership ambition, saying Mr Cameron should keep his job regardless of the referendum result; unlike the former Tory cabinet minister Owen Paterson who has refused to say the same. The prime minister, who argues EU membership offers more power to the UK, will take his case to the Commons this afternoon. There the stance of backbenchers will be closely watched in what is swiftly becoming an intense campaign. Mr Johnson said one of his reasons for supporting the Out campaign was his concern about the erosion of British sovereignty.However, his father, Stanley Johnson, told BBC Radio 5 live he disagreed with his son's argument.He denied Mr Johnson's decision had been a ""career move"", saying he had ""completely thrown away"" any chance of a post inside Mr Cameron's cabinet by aligning himself against the prime minister.Speaking before Mr Johnson's announcement, Mr Cameron said leaving the EU would give only an ""illusion of sovereignty"". ""If Britain were to leave the EU, that might give you a feeling of sovereignty, but you have got to ask yourself 'is it real?"" he told the Andrew Marr Show.The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the last 72 hours was the equivalent of a ""cork coming out of a bottle"" for the Conservatives, with ministers speaking openly about their views for the first time in years and big arguments being made.The Leave campaign has claimed that more than 100 Conservative MP could end up joining its side. The prime minister announced the date of the in/out referendum outside Number 10 on Saturday, having returned from agreeing a deal in Brussels that he argued gave the UK a ""special status"" within the EU.The agreement - which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU - includes changes to migrant welfare payments, safeguards for Britain's financial services and making it easier to block unwanted EU regulations.The Financial Times reports that bosses of about half of Britain's 100 biggest companies are preparing to back Mr Cameron's campaign to keep the country in the union."

On BBC Newsnight last week, Mr Goldsmith pledged to release his records after he was asked whether his own tax affairs compromised his ability to speak out against the activities of multi-nationals accused of tax avoidance.He has called on all mayoral candidates to do the same. Until 2010, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park held a non-dom tax status which he inherited from his father, Sir James Goldsmith. People with the status must pay tax on their UK earnings, but do not have to pay tax on any foreign income.The Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, Neil Coyle, called on the mayoral candidate to explain ""any detail of the benefits he derived from his non-domiciled tax status"", saying: ""Londoners deserve to know.""Releasing details of his returns today, Mr Goldsmith said: ""I became non-dom automatically because of my father's international status. It was not a choice, and I relinquished it seven years ago.""""I was born, grew up and have always lived in London - except for two years travelling abroad in my early 20s. Because of this I derived very little, if any, benefit from this status as my income came to the UK and was therefore taxed here.""Candidates' tax arrangements were one of the main areas of controversy during the 2012 mayoral election, leading to calls for politicians to publish their returns more routinely.

2016-02-22,Learning disabilities care 'shocking',https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35616956,"Treatment of some people with learning disabilities in hospitals and care homes is ""intolerable"", a review of the sector in England has found.Sir Stephen Bubb had recommended moving people to community care and a charter of rights, after the abuse scandal at Winterbourne View care home in 2011.In his final report, he criticised lack of progress and said a commissioner should be appointed to drive reform.The government is understood to be looking at all the recommendations.In 2011, the BBC's Panorama uncovered serious patient abuse and neglect at the Winterbourne View private hospital, near Bristol. Sir Stephen - who is chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations - was then asked by NHS England to examine how to address ""serious shortcomings"" in the support for those with learning disabilities.In November 2014, Sir Stephen published his report - Winterbourne View - Time for Change - that said many people were being kept in hospitals far from home for far too long.He made 10 recommendations, including closing large ""inappropriate in-patient facilities"" in favour of care services for people in their own community and the introduction of a legal charter of rights for them and their families. But he later reported an ""absence of any tangible progress"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, as he published his final report on Monday, Sir Stephen said: ""I have been really shocked by what I have heard about seclusion, around over-medication, around the use of physical restraint. ""It's an intolerable way to treat people with learning disabilities.""The right place for people is with their families and in the community, supported properly.""But Sir Stephen said that what needed to be addressed was ""not just around closing institutions"", it was also about how society treated people in the education and health systems. ""That's why my major recommendation today is for the establishment of a commissioner for learning disabilities - someone who will drive and act as an advocate for change and for making more progress,"" he said.The latest report, titled Time For Change - The Challenge Ahead, says some 3,500 vulnerable disabled people are still in institutions - 30%, or 900, more than had been thought.It suggests that supporting people in their own community will require 10,000 extra staff, who will need to be trained to an established standard.With at least 1,300 people expected to move out of hospital care by 2019, the report also says there is a ""critical need"" to develop housing for vulnerable people who, Sir Stephen says, should be exempt from proposed housing benefit caps.The Department of Health is understood to be looking at all of Sir Stephen's recommendations, including the establishment of a commissioner.  Health minister Alistair Burt said: ""It was only recently that NHS England announced a major programme to move people with learning disabilities out of hospital and into their communities...""This, combined with the increase in specialist staff including nurses, will transform care. ""We are not complacent and will work with the NHS, local government and others to make sure their plan is delivered.""Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow minister for mental health, said there had been ""too little progress"" since the Winterbourne scandal.""Tory ministers must avoid repeating their mistakes, accept these proposals and deliver the transformation in our learning disability services that is urgently required,"" she said."

Mr Duncan Smith, who is campaigning for an EU exit, also questioned the effectiveness of curbs to migrants' benefits on immigration to the UK.The senior minister's comments directly contradict David Cameron, who says the UK is ""safer and stronger"" in the EU.The PM told the BBC that leaving the EU would be ""a leap in the dark"".Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he also warned that leaving would give the UK an ""illusion of sovereignty"" but not full control.And Mr Cameron appealed to senior Conservative MP and London mayor Boris Johnson, who is expected to announce later that he will vote to leave the EU, to back the campaign to stay.His pitch came as Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith said he would campaign for exit in the 23 June referendum.Meanwhile, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said a vote to leave would mean the UK was ""in charge of our own country"".This is the new, if temporary reality: cabinet ministers disagreeing totally with each other on the record, and in public. Traditionally unthinkable, certainly risky, and difficult to control.Plenty of disagreements are spilling out into the public domain now. But while Boris Johnson keeps his counsel, not for very much longer, there is of course huge speculation not just about what he is going to do, but about what his motivations are.Read more from LauraSpeaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Duncan Smith said that being a member of the EU ""leaves the door open"" to attacks such as those in Paris last year.He suggested migrants arriving in the EU could eventually end up in the UK without proper consideration of their motivations. ""This open border does not allow us to check and control people that may come and spend time,"" he said.""We've seen what happened in Paris where they spent ages planning and plotting so who's to say it's not beyond the wit of man that those might already be thinking about that.""Asked directly whether he believed EU membership made the UK more vulnerable to Paris-style attacks, he replied: ""I think the present status of the open border we have right now many of us feel does actually leave that door open and we need to see that resolved.""Mr Duncan Smith also questioned whether proposals for an ""emergency brake"" on migrants' benefits - part of the deal negotiated by Mr Cameron - would do much to curb the number of people coming to the UK.Benefit payments were a ""small"" pull factor but control of the UK's borders was more significant and a ""glaring area"" that needed addressing.He noted that the initial plan was for an emergency brake on migration but the EU ""point blank refused to even discuss it"".Earlier, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Cameron defended his renegotiation of Britain's terms of EU membership, reached after two days of intense wrangling with EU leaders in Brussels this week.He said he had secured reforms ""people said weren't achievable"", including curbs to migrants' benefits and exempting Britain from ""ever closer union"". The offer on the table was a ""better"" deal for the UK and would be ""legally binding"", he said.Making his case for why Britain should stay in a ""reformed"" EU, Mr Cameron said it would safeguard the UK position in the single market and help in the fight against terrorism and crime. ""Safety in numbers in a dangerous world,"" he said.Proponents of Britain leaving the EU have argued it would give Britain back control of itself.But Mr Cameron warned: ""If we leave the EU that might give you a feeling of sovereignty - but is it real?""Would you have power to help businesses not be discriminated against in Europe? No,  you wouldn't. Would you have the power to insist European countries share with us their border information so we know what terrorists and criminals are doing in Europe? No, you wouldn't.""So you have an illusion of sovereignty but you don't have power, don't have control, you can't get things done.""He said he would be bringing forward proposals ""in the coming days"" to underpin the power of the UK Parliament.Mr Cameron also appealed to Mr Johnson not to join six ministers who attend cabinet in campaigning to leave the EU.""I'd say to Boris as I say to everyone else - we will be safer, stronger, better off inside the EU.""I think the prospect of linking arms with Nigel Farage and George Galloway and taking a leap into the dark is the wrong step for our country.""And if Boris and others really care about getting things done in our world, the EU is one of the ways in which we get things done,"" he said.Also on the Marr Show, Mr Farage criticised the scope of the PM's reform deal, and said it could be vetoed by the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.""There is one absolute certainty if we vote to leave... and that is that we will be in charge of our own country, we will make our own laws, we will run our own ministerial departments,"" he said.Employment minister Priti Patel, who is campaigning for an EU exit, told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics that the referendum was a chance for the UK to ""take back control"".By remaining a member of the EU, key decisions made in the UK risked ""being ridden over roughshod"" by EU institutions, she said.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that if the UK voted to leave the EU but Scotland did not, it would ""almost certainly"" trigger demands for another referendum on Scottish independence.Meanwhile, Hilary Benn, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC's Sunday Politics that EU membership was ""good for jobs, investment and growth"".He said ""the whole Labour movement"" would be campaigning to stay in, but he ruled out sharing a platform with Mr Cameron.""We make our own arguments in our way to try and win the case and the prime minister can do the same in his way with his party and the people that he is seeking to persuade,"" he said.Splits in the cabinet over the referendum have been laid bare by interviews and articles in Sunday's newspapers.Writing in the Observer, Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said ""leaving the EU would be a threat to our economic security and our national security"". In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Business Secretary Sajid Javid said he would be voting for the UK to remain in the EU with a ""heavy heart"" and no ""enthusiasm"". He said leaving the EU could add to ""economic turbulence"". However, Justice Secretary Michael Gove - a close friend and ally of Mr Cameron - wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that the EU was ""mired in the past"". He said choosing to join the leave campaign had been ""the most difficult decision of my political life"".Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers told the BBC leaving the EU was a safer option than staying in it.She said there had been a sense of history at the cabinet meeting to discuss the vote - the first to be called on a Saturday since the Falklands War.Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who is leading Labour's campaign to stay in the EU, said people should not be distracted by Conservative divisions over Europe, saying the referendum was about ""much more important issues"".Referring to the cabinet members who are campaigning for an EU exit, he said ""they're not the six most astute politicians that I've ever met in the cabinet"".Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems have said they are in favour of staying in the EU. The DUP said it will recommend voting to leave the bloc.Read more"
2016-02-22,"Relax Sunday trading laws, MPs say",https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35623976,"Rules on Sunday opening hours for shops in England and Wales are out of date and need to be relaxed, a group of 200 MPs and council leaders has said.In a letter to the Sunday Telegraph, they wrote that increasing spending on Sundays would boost job prospects and help shops compete with online firms.They backed government plans to devolve Sunday trading laws to local councils.However, the shopworkers' union said the majority of its members opposed extended Sunday trading hours.In the letter, the group - which includes the cross-party British Infrastructure Group (BIG) of MPs - said the world had changed ""a great deal"" since Sunday trading laws were last updated in 1994.""Yet whilst times and attitudes have changed, Sunday Trading laws have stayed the same,"" they wrote.""Our high streets and physical retailers have been left trying to compete with 24/7 online shopping, a task which is made harder by a shortened trading day at the weekend, just when many families might hope to go shopping together.""In England and Wales, shops over 280 sq m, or 3,000 sq ft, in size can open their doors for only six consecutive hours between 10:00 and 18:00. Retailers can be fined up to £50,000 if they break the rules.There are no trading restrictions in Scotland, while in Northern Ireland shops can open for up to five hours between 13:00 and 18:00.The letter supported a report by the BIG, which backs the modernisation of ""outdated retail law"".The group includes more than 40 MPs and is led by former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps.Its report argued the trend across Europe is for ""liberalising"" Sunday trading laws, saying that changes on the continent resulted in a 7‐9% net increase in employment.The Sunday Telegraph letter added: ""Ultimately, we believe that the best way to determine whether large shops are open for longer than six hours on a Sunday is to hand this decision to local communities. ""It is for this reason that we back the proposed change in England and Wales which would update our trading laws for the 21st Century.""Campaigners opposed to longer opening hours question if the move would really benefit the High Street, pointing out that under the existing law, smaller traders are allowed to open for longer.Last year, Chancellor George Osborne promised that councils and mayors would get the power to set Sunday trading laws in their areas.Business Secretary Sajid Javid earlier this month said ministers plan to press ahead with the proposal, saying the move would allow local authorities to ""help struggling high streets"".However, it faces strong opposition in the Commons.And retail union, Usdaw, has said the current trading hours give ""everyone a little bit of what they want"".""Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work; whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shop workers can spend some time with their family,"" general secretary John Hannett said."

The PM said: ""Those who want to leave Europe cannot tell you if British businesses would be able to access Europe's free trade single market, or if working people's jobs are safe, or how much prices would rise.""All they're offering is a risk at a time of uncertainty - a leap in the dark.""Ms Villiers, who was an MEP for six years, said she did not think the EU system was ""capable of changing in a way that would be the right option for us"". She said: ""In the decades ahead we face a European project that is ever more determined to integrate, to take more powers and we could be outvoted many times over the years to come.""So there is no stable status quo for us to cling to.""Even with this deal [negotiated with EU leaders by David Cameron] we will still be subject to the Court of European Justice who may still do its best to unpick the deal that's been agreed."" Ms Villiers said she was ""profoundly optimistic"" about the UK, which she said could ""flourish outside the EU"". She said Mr Cameron had won ""important concessions"" in Brussels.""But the reality is a really radical way to change our relationship is to vote to leave and then negotiate a deal based on the trade and co-operation that people thought we were signing up to when we joined the European Union.""It's long overdue that people have a right to decide on this, David Cameron is delivering that.""Ms Villiers said there had been ""a sense of history"" at Saturday's cabinet meeting at which ministers discussed which way they would vote in the referendum in June.""It was quite emotional. It was also very measured, very objective, very sincere,"" she said.""There was a determination that we wanted it to be a high-quality debate so people can make an informed choice, and to work courteously with each other even if we find ourselves on different sides.""She said it was ""very difficult to be on a different side"" to Mr Cameron but she didn't believe the divisions in the cabinet would lead to civil war in the Conservative Party. ""Ultimately, [it is] the arguments about what is good for our future, what will generate the best prosperity, what will make us most secure that will determine how people vote in the referendum - not how each cabinet member will vote.""The Republic of Ireland's main opposition party criticised Ms Villiers' decision, saying it was ""wrong for Northern Ireland"" and ""deeply worrying"".Fianna Fail spokesman on foreign affairs Brendan Smith said:  ""Secretary Villiers is entitled to her own views on this matter and that must be fully respected.""However, I believe it is clear that a Brexit would be bad for Northern Ireland and bad for Irish-British relations."""

2016-02-22,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-22,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-22,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday 23 June.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. "

2016-02-22,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-22,Safer in v safer out,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35600736,"Is Britain more - or less - at risk of a major terrorist attack if it leaves the EU?It is an important question and the public deserves a straight answer. Yet in the current heated debate it risks being both politicised and blurred by conflation with other issues like the economy, migration and policies towards Russia. So what are the facts?The UK is currently at threat level ""severe"", the second highest on the scale, meaning the government judges a terrorist attack to be ""highly likely"" (but not necessarily imminent). Britain is right up at the top of so-called Islamic State's target list, along with France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. MI5 and police estimate there to be more than 2,000 individuals living here who have sympathies with or connections to international terrorism, most of it IS-inspired. There are two principal reasons why the UK has not yet suffered the sort of Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack (MTFA) experienced twice by Parisians last year. One is better intelligence, the other is better borders. That said, no-one in counter-terrorism circles is being complacent that such an attack could not still happen here.After the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and then again after the London bombings of 2005, Britain's counter-terrorism infrastructure was reformed to break down inter-agency barriers and do away with the sort of departmental ""silos"" that, sadly, still exist in many European nations. So Britain's MI5, the domestic security service, works closely with MI6, the external intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ and the Metropolitan Police. Old rivalries have largely been set aside. Yet in France and Belgium the police and intelligence agencies hardly talk to each other, they share very little. Absurdly, for a Belgian police officer to find out what Belgian intelligence knows about a threat, he or she sometimes needs to learn it from the UK police, who learn it from UK intelligence, who learn it from Belgian intelligence. When it comes to EU-wide counter-terrorism, national intelligence agencies are even less willing to divulge their secrets.On borders, Britain has something that continental European countries do not: A single coastline. British counter-terrorism officials say that because the UK is not part of Europe's Schengen open borders agreement it is considerably more difficult - though not impossible - for terrorists and organised criminals to acquire the sort of powerful automatic weapons, notably Kalashnikovs, used in the Paris attacks last November.A senior EU counter terrorism official admitted to me last year, prior to the migrant crisis, that although the EU's external borders had been strengthened, once weapons had crossed over that border from the Balkans there was little to stop them being moved freely around Europe.The UK's strongest intelligence-sharing and security co-operation relationships are not with Europe, although those still matter. They are with the United States, with its massive eavesdropping and interception capabilities, and the other Anglophone so-called Five Eyes partner nations: Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Nearly all the most important intelligence-sharing with Europe tends to be done bilaterally, country to country, rather than through any EU-wide organisation. Britain also works closely with other partner nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia."
2016-02-22,Europeans' reaction,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35624694,"The UK will vote on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum in June but what do people from other EU countries think about Britain's big decision?David Cameron announced the date of the in/out referendum on Saturday, after returning from Brussels with a deal he argued gave Britain a ""special status"" within the EU.Here, Europeans - who contacted us via email and on Facebook - give their reaction to the referendum being called in the UK and their views on Britain's relationship with the EU.As a Bulgarian, I'm deeply affected by the EU referendum in the UK.More than 50,000 Bulgarians have moved to the UK, searching for work and a better life. Many of them are young and skilled men and women, working hard and paying taxes like everybody else. London is right to seek improvements in the EU.It is hard to create a common EU law without a real political and economic union. That's why I'm against the idea of ever-closer union.There might be some good ideas, such as the EU army, but overall the feeling that it is not the democratically elected national parliament taking the main responsibility for a country's future, but the European Parliament in Strasbourg, is somehow nonsense.The Union is in dire straits right now. There's a variety of different problems: The refugee crisis, lack of economic growth and Russian expansion to the East.And I believe we need Britain as a strong member of the EU, when we address all these issues.My feeling is that countries who do not believe in the values of the EU should leave the union.It will be better for the remaining countries, because only then can they create a real democratic, governed and socially united Europe.I think Mr Cameron is being populist and yet he only speaks with contempt for the EU. Britain should leave the EU for once and for all and then experience what it's like to be a lone country in a global capitalistic market place. Good luck with that. I only feel sad for the people of the UK who will have to suffer from these decisions. I feel the British campaign against the EU is fuelled by hate politics more than ever. It is not a healthy position to take. Goodbye, Britain.I am a French national living in Belgium but prior to moving to Brussels I lived for more than a decade in Southampton and London. For me, Europe is about more than just free trade. It is also about sticking together and preventing another world war. It is about sharing the same democratic values and principles. I feel happy about the deal reached by David Cameron, which stayed within the limits of the EU treaties. I would love to hear more from the UK about the positive changes the EU has brought to Britain, rather than only hearing about seemingly frivolous European laws or hordes of migrants apparently crossing the Channel to exploit British resources. Now it is time for the British people to decide and their decision will have to be respected, of course. I just hope that they decide to stay in the EU. I think that the British people underestimate their culture and in fact how much we rely on them when it comes to values and pragmatism, even if people from other member states don't want to admit it. The potential ""Brexit"" is a very emotional thing to me. What I fear most is that it could unravel with many grave consequences at all levels - social, economic and diplomatic.As a Dutchman and a real European, I would like to see the UK remain a member of the EU. It's better for Europe and also better for Britain. However, I don't want to have a member who receives special treatment. This is the second time the UK has received special treatment, with the last one being under Margaret Thatcher.It should be one rule for all. The other EU members were so weak to accept Cameron's proposals.And yet Mr Cameron then says he doesn't love Brussels, he loves Great Britain. It sounds so childish and unfriendly to the rest of Europe. I think British politicians have made a number of mistakes. Lots of people will certainly agree that the EU is far from perfect and needs reform. Also, a lot of the points your PM raised make sense, like the problem of social benefits. However, British politicians like to talk in public about the EU in a way as if it was an enemy and the other 27 member states were not your friends. The natural consequence was the lack of allies they needed in and before the recent negotiations.I'm often irritated when the British write and talk about Europe as if they were not part of it. This provokes rejection. If you tell me you don't want to have anything to do with the continent, people will say ""ok, then please go away"" and you can hardly count on our support for your matters, even if they make sense.Are you a European with a view on the UK's EU referendum?

2016-02-22,Referendum rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35634891,"Abraham Lincoln said that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand"". So how can the government stand when it is so utterly divided over Britain's future in the European Union? The short answer is that it has simply decided to suspend the usual rules demanding unity and loyalty. Cabinet ministers have been given permission to ignore collective responsibility which requires them to support government policy.That means that the five full members of the cabinet who are refusing to support the government's position of backing the Remain campaign can stay in their jobs.But, in a letter published last month, David Cameron set out some pretty tight constraints on what those ministers can do. 1) Collective responsibility has been suspended only for the EU referendum. The prime minister says in his letter: ""All other EU or EU-related business, including negotiations in or with all EU institutions and other member states, and debates and votes in Parliament here on EU business, will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility and party discipline.""The letter also makes clear that these rules still apply to ""policy discussions within government"", which means the cabinet. What is unclear is what happens when the cabinet meets to discuss the government's campaign to remain in the EU. Do pro-Leave ministers stay quiet? Do they recuse themselves? I spoke to two of these ministers this morning and they did not know what would happen.This also raises an interesting issue for the Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith. He wants to leave the EU. But as the welfare secretary, he will have to start work soon to introduce the benefit curbs for EU migrants that the prime minister agreed last weekend.The agreement - signed by all 28 heads of government - says that they will ""proceed with work on these legislative proposals as a matter of priority and do all within their power to ensure their rapid adoption"".So Mr Duncan Smith has to implement a deal that he has blithely dismissed and will campaign against in coming days. The solution may be simply for DWP officials to begin work on the deal with minimal involvement of their secretary of state. Which sets an interesting precedent for ministerial accountability. 2) Ministers backing Leave will also have to bite their lips in the House of Commons. The prime minister's letter says ministers will not be expected to contradict their position on the EU while they are speaking for the government. But he also says: ""In Parliament, the rules state that ministers speak from the front bench, and when they do so, they support government policy.""In other words, ministers cannot occasionally pop onto the backbenches to slag off their government and then nip back before the whips have noticed.3) The five pro-Leave ministers will not be able to rely on their civil servants quite as much as they are used to. The letter says that ""it will be the duty of the civil service to support (the government's position) in the normal way"" and adds: ""It will not be appropriate or permissible for the civil service or individual civil servants to support ministers who oppose the government's official position by providing briefings and speech material on this matter.""That means ministers will to have Google stuff all by themselves.4) And if those pro-Leave ministers are feeling a little beleaguered at having to type their own speeches, they can get only a little help from their special advisers.Mr Cameron's letter says that ministers can ""draw on personal help and advice from their special advisers"". Which sounds nice. Only those special advisers cannot ""draw on official or departmental resources"". They must do it ""in their own time"".Oh, and they have to inform the cabinet secretary's office before they do any of this. I know of one cabinet minister backing Leave who has chosen to get round all this by bringing in an old friend to act as an unofficial special adviser for the duration.Other special advisers have been less certain of the rules and have been asking Downing Street what they should be doing. One told me: ""We are all rather feeling our way on this.""In truth, Whitehall is not too worried about how the cabinet will operate in the run-up to June 23. This is, after all, a civil service that has had to deal with a coalition government for the last five years and that had a cabinet that was nothing if not divided.But government is going to be a little edgy in coming months. The rules of engagement that the prime minister has set out are limited in their scope and do not cover all scenarios.Much will depend on the flexibility and goodwill of ministers involved. And as this referendum campaign heats up, those are two commodities that could be in short supply."
2016-02-22,Decision time,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35602484,"Key decisions will be made shortly about transport infrastructure in what Chancellor George Osborne calls the Northern Powerhouse. But what will it mean in reality?George Osborne first spoke of creating a ""Northern Powerhouse"" - an economic success story in the north of England to rival London - in 2014. But the concept will finally begin to take form over the next few weeks when the quango Transport for the North publishes its report on regional transport priorities. The government's National Infrastructure Commission will make its recommendations too. A road and rail revolution is being promised, but what is likely to happen in practice?Northern Powerhouse 'a leap of faith'And Newcastle, Liverpool, York and Hull. The Northern Powerhouse is firmly focused on transport between towns and cities. The idea is to reduce travel-to-work times so high-end knowledge sector workers will seek jobs in different cities without needing to move house.George Osborne wants the North to operate as a single unit, much like Greater London, although tying outlying Newcastle, Liverpool and Hull into the central core of Leeds/Manchester will be a mighty feat.The first objective is to reduce the rail journey time between the biggest cities, Leeds and Manchester, to half an hour from around 50 minutes.But the Northern Powerhouse makes the assumption that would-be commuters in each city can easily reach the station. If they are young professionals in central apartments, working in city centre offices the other side of the Pennines, that'll be fine.If, on the other hand, they live in the suburbs and their workplace is not central, they will still face unappealing journey times that don't entice them to improve productivity with a trans-Pennine job. Manchester has the worst jams in the UK after London, and on a recent visit I found people desperate for the tram network to be extended to the size that would be normal in many similar European cities.There's a worry among travellers that huge sums being mooted for the inter-urban links of the Powerhouse will divert cash from desperately needed urban transport. One woman from the Manchester suburbs said: ""I don't want to commute to bloody Leeds. I want to be able to get into bloody Manchester.""The National Infrastructure Commission and Transport for the North agree rail services are inadequate - but they are also fixated on improving trans-Pennine road routes, especially for freight.Before considering brand new roads, the commission will push for the M62 to be made a smart motorway with hard-shoulder running along its length - although some transport campaigners are not yet convinced this is adequately safe.In planning to increase the capacity of a peripheral motorway like the M62, the North will be following the example set by London in expanding the M25.But will the North follow the more general example of London in gradually turning its back on the car on city streets? Since the London Mayor imposed road pricing, traffic slumped and bike journeys boomed along with the economy.More and more Londoners are abandoning cars altogether and some planners believe the future capital will have no space for private cars at all. Is this the aspiration for cities in the North and Midlands where drivers are more dearly wedded to their wheels?There's a debate to be had over the impact of the chosen infrastructure. New motorways are likely to spark a demand for more out-of-town development.But improved rail links will concentrate economic development on city centres which are easiest served by public transport, walking and cycling. In other words, the road/rail debate is about much more than transport - it's about the identity of cities in the future.The chancellor is keen to boost the economy of the North and improve productivity, which lags behind that of other key regions.But is infrastructure the best way to do that? In the mid-1990s the government's Standing Committee on Trunk Road Assessment analysed the traditional business adage ""roads bring jobs"".It concluded that a new road to a far-flung town might bring jobs - or it might take jobs away as a weak remote economy was exposed to the fierce breath of competition. Will Hull thrive or suffer if transport is radically improved to the eastern fringe of the Powerhouse? There's no way of telling.Some people think investment in skills, education and training would be a more certain way of improving productivity - and business leaders are keen to ensure that these key elements are not forgotten in the rush for steel and tarmac.I asked former CBI director-general John Cridland, who is now head of Transport for the North, if there was any certainty that spending billions on infrastructure would improve productivity. He agreed there was no proof, but urged people to take a leap of faith - like the Victorian engineers.The team behind the HS2 high-speed rail link from London to the North says the key factor in building the new track was the forecast for future passenger numbers. The demand on the network is simply too high to be delivered by current tracks, so a new route is the only way, it argues.Many oppose that decision, but the National Infrastructure Commission will apply a similar logic to the Northern Powerhouse. Its first question will be: can the existing system be upgraded?The two big projects that have excited engineers and the firms who make fortunes out of them are HS3 - the proposed new fast rail link through the Pennines, and even more heroic, the road tunnel from Sheffield to Manchester, which would not have to close in bad weather.These two cities are reputedly the worst-connected of their size anywhere in Europe.Politicians accept that they can't touch the precious Peak District National Park, so the idea is to tunnel underneath it from the edge of one city to the edge of the other. At more than 30 miles, it would be one of the longest tunnels in the world.This sort of infrastructure stirs passions. What a declaration of love from Westminster to the North! But there would be problems.First is the impact on the Peak Park. Until we get all-electric cars, the subterranean vehicles and their occupants will need to breathe as they drive. That means ventilation shafts thrusting awkwardly through the peat bogs. Each vent will spew polluted air that may alter the chemistry of the moors.The road would also stimulate huge demand for development on the periphery of each city, generating even more traffic on surrounding roads.Then there's the factor which will almost surely kill the project for the next few decades - the price. Highways England hasn't revealed its estimate yet, but the people behind the Powerhouse suspect it will be prohibitive.HS3 is a proposed rail link from Leeds to Manchester which includes tunnelling beneath the Pennines. But HS3 is a misnomer. The distance between the two cities is so short at about 40 miles that high-speed trains won't be high-speed at all. It's been estimated they could reach 125mph (200km/h).The proposals could mean using existing but unused Pennine tunnels or building new ones.But the first priority would be to electrify the current track and increase the number of carriages at rush hour. If passenger demand follows capacity supply, another track may be considered in the future.Expect pragmatic decisions in the first instance, not heroic ones.Follow Roger Harrabin on Twitter @rharrabinThe government is pressing ahead with the HS2 high-speed rail link between London and the North of England, but there are critics who believe the money could be better spent elsewhere. But what are the alternatives? Here are five infrastructure projects, suggested by experts. Could these five projects improve life in the UK?

2016-02-22,Balanced deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35620821,"David Cameron will now begin the campaign that will define his legacy and his time in office. The battleground for the next four months has been laid out. The prime minister and the ""in"" campaign will insist that the UK's relationship with the EU has been fundamentally changed, with several key demands met.But those who want to leave the UK say it is a ""hollow deal"", that the negotiations were weak in their ambition and Britain has not regained control over its laws or its borders. They question whether the emergency brake on migrant benefits will have any impact on immigration numbers - and point out that the legislation on this will have to be passed by the European Parliament only AFTER Britain has voted in a referendum. And the critics whose ambition is to see powers being returned to Westminster will also point out that the UK has not regained the right to over-rule EU laws. So that is the battleground at home but Mr Cameron had also claimed there ""was a big prize for everyone in the room"" in fundamentally reforming the EU. But the other member states did not choose to seize this moment to embrace wider reforms, underscoring that Britain remains exceptional, the outsider.The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the settlement addressed all of the Prime Minister's concerns ""without compromising our fundamental values"". For the rest of the EU that was crucial. There was the will to help David Cameron but the other leaders were not prepared to weaken the EU's core beliefs.Freedom of movement has not been compromised. The march towards deeper integration has not been slowed. The President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be ""no power of veto over the eurozone"" - not that Britain was seeking that. What the French wanted to underline was that Britain would not win any ""exceptions to the rules of the EU"" - particularly in relation to regulation in the City.Even so some European leaders are uncomfortable. This deal recognises that there are different layers of integration. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said: ""There is a risk of us losing sight of the original European dream.""  Belgium was greatly exercised that other countries might want to opt out from further integration. There is an underlying fear of contagion that other countries might seek similar opt-outs, so leading to an unravelling of the EU. In the end, the political battle will almost certainly not be fought on the details of this deal. It will be fought over the economic risks of leaving the EU and whether the UK can regain control over its laws and borders."
2016-02-22,Risking it all,https://web.archive.org//web/20160223063350/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35599680,"It gets cold, very very cold, waiting at the entrance of the European Council building in Brussels. You can spend several hours being jostled by French camera crews, squashed by Italian snappers, or shoved unceremoniously out of the way by any one of 27 other countries' journalists as the leaders of the European Union arrive one by one, and we frantically try to grab a word with them as they rush past. There'll be sharp elbows in the press pen, craning of necks and stretching of microphones, as David Cameron arrives at this summit, which could define not just his leadership, but the future of his party and his country's place in the world. But how on earth did the man who once accused the Conservatives of being out of touch for ""banging on about Europe"", get himself into a position where he has already been ""banging on about Europe"" for months and months, and will spend the next four months still doing precisely that? Since he made that claim in his first season as party leader in 2006, appearing in front of a huge video screen tastefully projected with a giant tree, there have been three big changes, linked, that have got him to this juncture, which of course ultimately is a product of his own political calculation.Most simply, as the years have passed, his party has changed. Since the Maastricht rebels failed to get a public vote in 1993 on the treaty that created the modern version of the European Union, there has been a rump of Conservatives deeply passionate about the cause, significantly concerned that the EU's laws, not Britain's own, are more important - the question of sovereignty that's a big part of the current talks. But their concerns, while shared by many Conservative Party members, were not considered mainstream in the parliamentary party - balanced, if not squeezed out, by heavyweight Europhile voices. But as the EU expanded, and generations of MPs came and went, a soft scepticism towards the European project, neither full-throated support, nor hardcore opposition, became more common, and sympathy for the idea of a referendum spread from the margins. The eurozone financial crisis, and the EU's stumbling approach to sorting it out, gave a fresh energy to eurosceptic MPs who wanted to campaign to leave.  In part that apathy, if not downright dislike, towards the EU spread because of the enormous rise in the numbers of people from around the Union who came to live and work in the UK. Numbers that took the political establishment completely by surprise began to arrive from the moment new countries like Poland joined the EU in 2004. There is a complicated, and emotional debate about the impact of the numbers, but few can dispute that the effect has been very significant in some parts of the country, with figures this week showing the numbers still rising, standing at more than two million now. For many people, that very visible impact of our membership of the EU has given them pause for thought.And it was that steep rise in EU immigration that gave David Cameron his most pressing political reason for - in the end - promising a referendum. UKIP's appeal grew alongside the rise in immigration. By 2012, they were greedily nibbling at the Conservative vote with a record performance in the local elections and a leader who in some moments seemed to appeal to swathes of the public for his plain speaking, in a style that also alienated many others. A drive to address the threat from UKIP and satisfy growing internal demands for the promise of a referendum led eventually to Mr Cameron's commitment in the 2013 speech to give the public a vote on whether to stay or go. It's worth remembering that, perhaps strangely, the 2013 speech in which he made his promise to hold a vote made no mention of immigration. But add a general election and increasing public concern to the mix and three years later, his hopes of limiting benefits for migrants are the centrepiece of his renegotiation. The prime minister is not a politician who is known for getting hung up on the past, his seemingly bomb-proof - if maybe sometimes misplaced - confidence in his own abilities tends to lead him to look forward. He is not a prisoner of his record. But as he arrives in Brussels on Thursday, and gets out of the shiny black limousine to sweep past the journalists clamouring to ask a question, will he consider even, for a moment, the irony that he may be risking it all for something he once more or less dismissed as a fringe concern?"

Mr Gove - one of five cabinet ministers campaigning for the UK to quit the EU - told the BBC that the European Court of Justice could overturn the changes.But Number 10 said the settlement had ""legal force"".It described it as an ""irreversible International Law Decision"".It cited a former director of legal services at the EU, Alan Dashwood, who said the ""Decision"" was a binding legal agreement reached by consensus and could only be amended or rescinded by consensus - or, ""in other words, with the agreement of the UK"".""So, in that sense, it is irreversible,"" he said.The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowHow the EU worksDoes the EU impact on UK sovereignty?UK and the EU: Better off out or in?Remain v Leave: Where do MPs stand?The EU in 10 objects: The sausageThe PM has previously said the package is ""already legally binding and irreversible"", and could only be overturned by all EU states including the UK.A UK referendum on whether to remain a member of the EU will take place on 23 June.The reform deal paving the way for the referendum promises changes to the EU's binding treaties in two areas - exemption for the UK from an ""ever-closer union"" and protection for countries not using the euro.Mr Gove, a close friend of the PM, told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the facts are that the European Court of Justice is not bound by this agreement until treaties are changed and we don't know when that will be"".He said Mr Cameron was ""absolutely right that this is a deal between 28 nations all of whom believe it"", adding: ""But the whole point about the European Court of Justice is that it stands above the nation states.""Mr Cameron has ""not been misleading anyone"", Mr Gove went on, but he added: ""I do think it's important that people also realise that the European Court of Justice stands above every nation state, and ultimately it will decide on the basis of the treaties and this deal is not yet in the treaties.""Analysis: 'Europe could throw out the changes'By BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergMr Gove's comments will be catnip for eurosceptics who've already been arguing that Mr Cameron's deal is hardly worth the paper its written on.For David Cameron, maintaining the sense that the deal he's achieved can and will improve the UK's relationship with the rest of the European Union in a meaningful way is a vital part of his campaign.It's one thing Tories from different parts, different generations of the party, disagreeing.

The package negotiated by David Cameron also includes a reduction in the amount of child benefit EU migrants can claim for children living overseas, and an ""emergency brake"" on their in-work benefits.A ""red card"" system allowing national parliaments to club together against unwanted EU legislation was also agreed.Ministers who want to quit the EU have been allowed special dispensation to oppose the government at the referendum, although strict rules have been put in place for the campaign.In the BBC interview, his first since deciding to oppose Mr Cameron in the referendum, Mr Gove also said a vote to leave the EU would offer ""a tremendous opportunity for Britain to recover its mojo"", calling the union an ""old-fashioned model"".Elsewhere in the EU referendum debate, 13 senior military officers have signed a letter to the Daily Telegraph saying being in the EU ""helps us to safeguard our people, our prosperity and our way of life"".The signatories include Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a Normandy veteran and former chief of the defence staff, and Lord Dannatt, who was chief of the defence staff until 2009.The letter says Nato is ""the most important alliance for maintaining Britain's national security"", but adds that EU membership is another ""increasingly important pillar of our security""."

The study author, Domenico Pagano, refused to corroborate Mr Hunt's use of the figures, saying: ""It will be inaccurate and counterproductive to quote that our analysis is due to be published in the BMJ shortly, as this is not the case and may seem to interfere with the peer review process.""When finally published in September 2015, the research actually suggested there were 11,000 excess deaths per year as a result of the ""weekend effect"" - although the authors pointed out this could not be proven to be linked to staffing levels.A separate string of emails seen by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act shows officials at Whitehall and NHS England then backtracked, using a combination of figures already in the public domain from 2009 and 2012 to attempt to provide an explanation for the 6,000 excess deaths claim. NHS England then published this in a ""low-key fashion"" on their website on 6 August.One official at the Department of Health wrote to another at NHS England explaining the fudge, saying: ""I am keen to avoid undue criticism of either [the Department of Health] or NHS England'.NHS England has now admitted Mr Hunt had had advance sight of ""headline figures"" of the BMJ study prior to it being accepted for publication. A spokesman said NHS medical director for England Sir Bruce Keogh and one of the study's authors alongside Dr Pagano, had shared some findings with ""interested parties"" including the Department of Health and the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB).This is despite NHS England's Freedom of Information Officer saying in October last year: ""Sir Bruce Keogh did not discuss the study's findings with anyone at the Department of Health at any point before or after the publication of this article.""NHS England now says this October statement is ""clearly a mistake, and absurd"" and Sir Bruce is ""devastated"" the focus has now shifted from ""the issues of patient safety"".NHS England said: ""The data on this topic has been consistent and it cannot be dismissed or ignored.  ""We make no apology for using data and analysis to inform NHS and government policy in the best interests of patients.""A Department of Health spokesman said: ""This 6,000 figure was NHS England's analysis. Subsequent independent clinical studies have shown further variation in the quality of care across the week, and more recent analysis makes clear there could actually be as many as 11,000 excess deaths owing to the 'weekend effect'.""Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said: ""This is an extremely serious state of affairs given the weight attached to these figures by the health secretary in justifying changes to junior doctors' contracts.""Rather than admitting the source of the figures, it seems that civil servants had to cobble together a post-hoc rationalisation for Jeremy Hunt's sound bites.""There now needs to be a full investigation about whether pressure was put upon officials and whether the health secretary was involved."""
2016-02-23,Holyrood 'could get new powers early',https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35646303,"Claims that new powers could be devolved to Holyrood earlier than anticipated have been dismissed by Scotland's finance secretary.John Swinney was responding to the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, who said some of the new powers could be in place shortly after May's election. But Mr Swinney accused Mr Mundell of a ""leap of imagination"". The Scottish and UK government agreed a deal on the so-called fiscal framework on Tuesday. The framework sets out how the block-grant that the Scottish government receives from Westminster would be altered to take account of new powers over areas such as income tax and VAT that are being devolved under the Scotland Bill. It had been seen as the last major stumbling block to the Scotland Bill being devolved, with the general expectation being that the new powers would come into force next year. Mr Mundell told Holyrood's devolution committee on Tuesday that he expected control over income tax to pass to MSPs by April 2017,  in time for the next budget of the new Scottish Parliament.But he anticipated that a number of the other new powers ""will be in place almost immediately after the Scottish Parliament elections"".He added: ""One of the other tax powers for example, Air Passenger Duty, can be transferred at the point that the Scottish government has its model ready for that transfer. ""If the arrangements are available shortly after the Scottish Parliament election we would be able to transfer them.""In relation to the wider powers and the wider tax, we place no impediment in relation to the transfer of those powers.""However, speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said he did not agree with Mr Mundell's assessment.He said: ""The whole devolution process cannot commence until we have put in place distinctive legislation within Scotland. ""To see that coming earlier than 2017 - and even 2017 strikes me as being quite early - is quite a leap of imagination.""Mr Swinney said that the Smith Commission recommendations and ""many elements"" of the Vow on new powers made by the three main UK party leaders ahead of the independence referendum had now been delivered.But he said Gordon Brown's promise that something ""near federalism"" would be delivered if Scots rejected independence had still not been fulfilled. And he denied that the fiscal framework was a ""trap"" set by the Treasury, adding: ""It could have been a trap if I'd fallen for it but I didn't"".Mr Mundell is expected to give more details of the fiscal agreement to the House of Commons later.Talks over the fiscal framework, which began in March of last year, had stalled over different interpretations of a key line of the Smith Commission agreement, which said there should be ""no detriment"" to either the UK or Scottish budgets as a result of the changes.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the deal, reached after 10 rounds of negotiations, meant ""not a single penny of detriment to the Scottish government's budget"" for six years, followed by a review of future arrangements. Chancellor George Osborne said the agreements were ""fair to Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK"".Lord Smith of Kelvin, who chaired the cross-party Smith Commission set up after the ""No"" vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, said the deal on new powers for Holyrood could now be ""delivered in full"". He said: ""The next term of Scottish parliamentarians will be debating and taking decisions over large parts of Scotland's tax and welfare policy. I believe this will be transformational for our parliament.""There should be no doubt that this was a highly complex package of measures to agree. It is difficult to imagine a bigger test of inter-governmental relationships and while it was obviously a very tough negotiation, what matters is that an agreement was reached. ""This provides an excellent basis for constructive engagement between the governments long into the future. ""When the Smith Agreement was passed to the prime minister and first minister, both gave their word that they would deliver it into law - they have met that promise in full."""
2016-02-23,Deal agreed for Scottish funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35641714,"The Scottish and UK governments have reached a financial deal enabling new powers for Holyrood.Negotiations over the fiscal framework have been going on since March 2015, with a lengthy deadlock over the issue of Scotland's block grant.Confirming a deal had been done, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said ""not a single penny"" would be taken from the Scottish government's budget.Details of the deal will be published soon so Holyrood scrutiny can begin.The deal, which is the financial basis for new powers to be devolved as part of the Scotland Bill, was settled after Chancellor George Osborne spoke to Ms Sturgeon on the phone.He said the agreement created a ""stronger Scotland in a stronger UK"".The MP told the BBC: ""It delivers on the vow we made to the people of Scotland.""It is fair to the taxpayers of all of the UK and it gives Scotland one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.""Ms Sturgeon and Finance Secretary John Swinney had earlier informed MSPs that there was only one issue outstanding in the talks, the substance of a five-year review of the agreement.The two sides had disputed a key line of the Smith Commission agreement on new powers, which said there should be ""no detriment"" to either the UK or Scottish budgets as a result of the deal.Ms Sturgeon said the deal agreed would see ""not a single penny of detriment"" now or ""at any point in the future"".Addressing parliament, she added: ""There is now an agreement in principle that we can recommend to parliament.""There will be not a single penny of detriment to the Scottish government's budget as a result of the devolution of powers during the transition period, for the next six years to March 2022.""She paid tribute to Mr Swinney over his role in the protracted negotiations, saying it had been much ""harder work than it should have been"" to stop the Treasury from carrying out a ""cash grab"" from Scottish budgets.Prime Minister David Cameron said it was ""a significant day of devolution"", which would deliver a ""powerhouse parliament"" in Scotland.He added: ""We have reached a deal which is fair to Scotland and fair to the whole of the UK. ""It delivers accountability to the Scottish government and transforms politics in Scotland. It means May's Holyrood elections can be fought on the issues which matter most: how the Scottish government should use these extensive new powers, rather than what they are.""I welcome this agreement which shows that Scotland's two governments can work constructively together for the benefit of Scottish people.""Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale welcomed the deal, saying it was ""a historic moment for Scotland"". Her party had backed the Scottish government's position in the negotiations.She said: ""Scottish politics will never be the same again thanks to these new powers. We have entered a new and exciting era of devolution.""Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, who later gave evidence to the devolution committee on the matter, said he was ""very pleased"" that a deal had been reached.He insisted he had ""always been confident"" an agreement would be reached because both the UK and Scottish governments had wanted what was best for Scotland and the whole of the UK.The final sticking point in the talks revolved around how Scotland's block grant from Westminster would be reduced in light of new fundraising powers being devolved as part of the Scotland Bill.Scotland's population is projected to grow more slowly than that of the UK's in the coming years, and the two parties disagreed over how to balance out the financial impact of this after the first five years of the deal.A compromise was reached on how this would work for the first five years. However, if no deal could be reached at the review, the UK government wanted to revert to the original proposal, which Ms Sturgeon described as Scotland bearing the brunt of ""population driven detriment"".The new deal will see the review carried out without any prior expectation of Scotland taking on an extra financial burden, and an independent study would be carried out to inform that process."
2016-02-23,Aston Martin creates 750 jobs in Wales,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-35640339,"Aston Martin is to build its new luxury car in south Wales, creating 750 highly-skilled jobs.The DBX Concept car will be hand-made in a super hangar at St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan.It is a major coup for Wales, which took two years to secure the deal ahead of 20 locations across the world.As well as attracting one of motoring's most prestigious names, it is expected to create around 1,000 jobs with suppliers and local business.Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer called it a ""momentous day for Wales"" at a news conference in Cardiff on Wednesday.The development will include a skills academy, which will make St Athan and the Vale of Glamorgan a centre of excellence.Work on the factory will start in 2017 and production will start three years later. ""We have a wealth of craftsmanship here,"" said Mr Palmer. ""It takes 200 hours to make a car and to do that we need skilled labour and we have got that skilled labour in Wales, in Great Britain and that played a big part in our decision.""The company is also bringing more work to its factory and headquarters at Gaydon in Warwickshire bringing the total of jobs created to 1,000.The value of the deal is in the hundreds of millions of pounds, although the Welsh government will not comment on the amount of support it is giving.Mr Palmer said there were a number of reasons why St Athan had been chosen for the new site.""The Welsh offer wasn't financially enticing but share holders had to understand the balance that had to be made on quality, cost and time, and St Athan was on time,"" he said.""We don't have to build a building.  It won through in terms of quality of workforce and supplies and relationship with the government of Wales.""In its 103-year history Aston Martin has only sold just over 70,000 cars.To continue to survive at the luxury end of the market it has been looking at broadening its range to appeal to younger - and female - customers.The car - which is an all-electric 4x4 and expected to cost at least £160,000 to buy - was unveiled at the Geneva motor show last year.Mr Palmer said then that the company envisaged a world ""perhaps a world not too far away, when luxury GT travel is not only stylish and luxurious but also more practical, more family-friendly and more environmentally responsible"".The design team had in mind a driver who was a young woman, American - and rich. The fictitious customer was dubbed Charlotte and seen as ""an attractive lady, cool, in her 30s"". First Minister Carwyn Jones said it was the start of a long-term relationship between Wales and Aston Martin.""We will work together in building on the strong foundations of our partnership to nurture a prosperous and rewarding future for this iconic company and its skilled workforce in Wales,"" he said.Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb called the announcement an ""enormous boost"" for Wales and the British car industry.He added: ""It is a genuine example of a 'one nation' achievement, with both the UK and Welsh governments working together to attract this prestige manufacturer to Welsh shores.""Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Mr Palmer said the company had chosen Wales because it was ""the best offer"".""I don't simply mean in terms of money. What really swung it was the passion and the professionalism of the people we dealt with in Wales,"" he said.Economy Minister Edwina Hart AM said: ""We had an excellent relationship with Aston Martin at official and ministerial level.""The important thing for us was ensuring that Aston Martin stayed in the UK, a fine company for the UK.""We fought very hard to ensure we were on the list and now we've achieved having it.""This is a win not just for Wales but for the UK.""ASTON MARTIN THROUGH THE YEARSA GEAR CHANGE FOR THE WELSH CAR INDUSTRYMrs Hart called it a ""significant moment in the history of the automotive sector in Wales"". Indeed, for the Welsh car industry this is a tremendous pat on the back.It will also put it at the forefront of developing eco-friendly performance vehicles.Apart from the short-lived Gilbern in the 1960s and early 1970s, whole cars have not been made in Wales before.But there are 150 companies in Wales making car components, employing 18,000 workers and with a combined turnover of £3.3bn.Some already make parts for Aston Martin but these are relatively few. But there are many others which already supply Jaguar, Land Rover, Ford and Honda - a record Aston Martin will have taken notice of. After the announcement, there was disappointment in other areas - including the West Midlands - which had failed to land the deal.The company said it was not just about money but it was ""consistently impressed with the focus on quality, cost and speed from the Welsh government team"". Wales' status as a maker of parts for car assembly plants beyond its borders is about to change - and with style. Think Aston Martin and you think James Bond, glamorous women and a sense of cool and from 2020, Wales will be part of that world too. "
2016-02-23,Privately educated 'dominate top jobs',https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35641061,"Leading British actors are more than twice as likely as stars in the music industry to have attended fee-paying schools, the Sutton Trust says.It also says professions like politics and the law continue to be dominated by privately educated Oxbridge graduates.The Trust said a child's chances of reaching the top still came down to their schooling and contacts.The government said the state sector was increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment. Researchers for the Trust, which campaigns for greater social mobility, looked at the educational backgrounds of more than 1,200 people, working in high positions in medicine, the law, the military, journalism, politics, the civil service, business, film and pop music.They also looked at Nobel Prize-winners.The report - Leading People 2016 - found that more than two in five (42%) of British Bafta winners went to a private school, compared with around a fifth (19%) of those who have been awarded a Brit music award.Also, two-thirds (67%) of British Oscar winners were privately educated, among them Eddie Redmayne, who went to Eton, and Kate Winslet, who studied at Redroofs Theatre School.The Sutton Trust suggested the successful state-funded BRIT school in Croydon, which counts Adele and Jessie J among its former pupils, may be one reason why the proportion of state-educated top music stars is higher.The research found that three-quarters (74%) of the UK's top judges went to a fee-paying school, and nearly eight in 10 (78%) went on to Oxford or Cambridge University.Among top military personnel, some seven in 10 (71%) were educated in the private sector, although just 14% were Oxbridge educated.Slightly more than half of leading print journalists and solicitors (51% each) attended fee-paying schools.Just over half (54%) of these journalists attended Oxford or Cambridge, along with 55% of solicitors and 51% of the senior civil servants included in the study.In politics, half the Cabinet were privately educated (including old Etonian Prime Minister David Cameron) compared with 13% of the shadow cabinet, and around a third (32%) of MPs.The current Cabinet does have fewer former independent school pupils than the coalition cabinet of 2010, the report notes, but slightly more than Tony Blair's post-election Cabinet in 2005.Just under half (47%) of the current cabinet are Oxbridge graduates, along with 32% of the shadow cabinet.The trust said that of the country's top doctors, 61% were educated at independent schools, nearly one-quarter at grammar schools (22%) and the remainder (16%) at comprehensives. The private school sector educates 7% of the population.""The top of many of the UK's most prestigious professions remain disproportionately constituted by those with elite educational and socio-economic backgrounds,"" the study says.Sutton Trust research fellow Dr Philip Kirby, who wrote the report, said: ""Young people from more advantaged backgrounds often have broader professional social networks, which can be used to access certain jobs, as well as parents who might be more able to support them through unpaid internships, which are increasingly important for career development.""Chairman of the Sutton Trust Sir Peter Lampl said: ""Our research shows that your chances of reaching the top in so many areas of British life are very much greater if you went to an independent school. ""As well as academic achievement, an independent education tends to develop essential skills such as confidence, articulacy and team work which are vital to career success.""The key to improving social mobility at the top is to open up independent schools to all pupils based on merit not money as demonstrated by our successful Open Access scheme, as well as support for highly able students in state schools.""A  spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""Thanks to our reforms - which are underpinned by a total commitment to social justice - 1.4 million more pupils and counting are being taught in good or outstanding state schools than in 2010. ""As the independent Good Schools Guide has recognised - the state sector is increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment and learning environment.""University entrants are at an all-time high, with rising numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university and the number of disadvantaged students attending Russell Group universities doubling since 2010. ""We are determined to spread this educational excellence everywhere, extending true social mobility for all. We are continuing the pupil premium at current rates for the duration of this parliament."""

2016-02-23,No civil service help for exit ministers,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35642296,"Civil servants have been banned from helping ministers make the case for leaving the EU, prompting claims the establishment is lined up against them.Michael Gove and other ministers campaigning for Britain's exit will also be unable to use official briefings to prepare campaign speeches.But civil servants will be allowed to help ministers arguing for Britain to ""remain in a reformed EU"", No 10 said.UKIP described the move as a ""total stitch-up"".The rule change was announced by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood.Downing Street said civil servants and special advisers should not give ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU access to government papers, apart from ones they have already seen, on the referendum or David Cameron's EU renegotiations.But officials should continue to support the ministers in all other aspects of government business in their normal way, a spokesman added.The Conservative Party is officially neutral in the referendum but the government's official policy is that Britain should remain in the EU - and civil servants are duty bound to support government policies.But leave campaigners are likely to argue the move will give the remain campaign an unfair advantage on 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EU.I know of one cabinet minister backing Leave who has chosen to get round all this by bringing in an old friend to act as an unofficial special adviser for the duration.Other special advisers have been less certain of the rules and have been asking Downing Street what they should be doing. One told me: ""We are all rather feeling our way on this.""In truth, Whitehall is not too worried about how the cabinet will operate in the run-up to June 23. This is, after all, a civil service that has had to deal with a coalition government for the last five years and that had a cabinet that was nothing if not divided.But government is going to be a little edgy in coming months.Read more from JamesNorthern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, one of five cabinet ministers to join the leave campaign, said it was another example of the forces against them.""The leave campaign is the underdog, no doubt about that. Much of the establishment is lined up in favour of EU membership, as they have been in the past,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. The cabinet is split over the issue with 17 full members in favour of staying in the EU and five wanting to leave. Conservative MPs are also split - 142 to 120 at the latest count in favour of staying. David Cameron said on Tuesday he though London mayor Boris Johnson ""has got this one wrong"" by being in favour of the UK leaving the EU.In a letter outlining the changes to the civil service code, Sir Jeremy said: ""Civil servants can draft ministerial speeches and provide briefing on government policy for ministers... including those organised by groups campaigning for the same outcome as the government on the EU referendum."" It says ministers will ""be able to take a different personal position from that of the Government on the issue of the EU referendum.""But it adds: ""This wholly exceptional arrangement applies only to the question of whether the UK should remain in a reformed EU or leave. All other EU or EU-related business, including negotiations in or with all EU institutions and other Member States, and debates and votes in the UK Parliament on EU business will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility and party discipline.""The rules will apply until 28 days before the referendum, when they will be reviewed, he added.UKIP MEP Nathan Gill said Whitehall's approach represented an ""appalling cover-up"" and that people should know what contingency plans the government has made for a UK exit from the EU.""To not give the public that information in order that they can make an informed decision on such a huge issue is the greatest insult to democracy,"" he added.Elsewhere in the EU referendum debate, former prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC a vote to leave could change the future of the UK by ""providing the justification for Scottish independence"", warning this would be a ""huge mistake for the country"".Mr Blair said he supported Mr Cameron in making the case for a vote to remain, saying the PM had achieved a ""great deal"" in his negotiations."

Lord Lawson then joked: ""I would be very happy if the Republic of Ireland - I don't think it's going to happen - were to say we made a mistake in getting independence in 1922, and come back within the United Kingdom. That would be great.""When asked if a UK withdrawal from the EU would result the reinstatement of security checks along the Irish border, he said: ""There are checks now because of the terrorist problem. ""That's one of the places where terrorists are checked. I'm not at all sure there needs to be anything further. I don't see why there should be.""However, earlier this week Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness warned the implications of a UK withdrawal from the EU would be ""absolutely enormous"" for Northern Ireland.His Sinn Féin party, which is campaigning to stay in the EU, said an exit would ""undoubtedly led to a reinforcement of the border and greater restrictions on the movement of people, livestock and goods from one part of this island to the other""."

Sir Bernard told MPs that suspects such as Lord Bramall had to wait to be told about the outcome of his case until the police and Crown Prosecution Service had completed their work.He also defended the decision to send 22 officers to search Lord Bramall's home during the investigation into the abuse allegations.Sir Bernard expressed ""regret"" for the effect of the inquiry on Lord Bramall but repeatedly refused to apologise at the parliamentary committee.During one exchange, Conservative MP Tim Loughton referred to a ""media circus"" surrounding the case.Sir Bernard said: ""Ah the media circus. If what you mean is that you want me to be bullied into apologising then that won't happen.""Mr Loughton replied: ""So you think you're being bullied, do you?""Sir Bernard said: ""I'm asking you whether that's what you think.""Lord Bramall, a Normandy veteran who retired from the House of Lords in 2013, previously told the BBC there was not ""one grain of truth"" in the allegations, made against him by a man in his 40s.Lord Bramall served during the D-Day landings during World War Two and commanded UK land forces between 1976 and 1978.The peer became chief of the general staff - the professional head of the Army - in 1979, and in 1982 he oversaw the Falklands campaign.Later that year he became chief of the defence staff - the most senior officer commanding the UK's armed forces."

The move is designed to reach beyond Westminster and the emerging divisions within the Tory party. The Mayor of London Boris Johnson, the most high-profile politician to back EU exit, has urged people to focus on the issues and played down talk of ill feeling between him and the PM, saying ""team spirit"" within the party was good.In a move described by No 10 as ""unprecedented"", chairmen or chief executives of 36 FTSE 100 companies signed the letter, organised by Stronger in Europe and Downing Street, backing the campaign to stay in the EU, including Burberry, BAE Systems and EasyJet. The FTSE bosses were among a total of 198 signatories from the business world, including the chief executives of Heathrow and Gatwick airports.However, nearly two-thirds of the UK's largest publicly listed businesses did not sign, including RBS and Barclays.Asked about why the majority of FTSE 100 companies did not sign the letter, Mr Cameron said companies were often reluctant to ""make any form of political statement"".But he added: ""If the leave campaign could produce 35 business leaders of this sort of stature they'd be over the moon and I don't think they have the prospect of doing that with FTSE 100 leaders in any way.""On Boris Johnson's decision to campaign against him, the prime minister said he had ""huge respect"" for the London Mayor and he had ""great future in British politics"" but added: ""He has got it wrong on this one.""Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has meanwhile, said policymakers are ""not making a judgment"" on the outcome or consequences of the referendum.Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that the Bank was treating the June vote as it would ""every other political event"".Analysis by the BBC's business editor Kamal AhmedFor politicians supporting Britain remaining in the European Union, the blessing of business leaders is seen as a positive step.And the list signing the pro-European letter - at least in part orchestrated by Number 10 - are certainly a hefty bunch. But a few health warnings.First, many of the people who have signed have long been public advocates of Britain remaining in the EU. These include Sir Roger Carr of BAE, Iain Conn of Centrica, Dame Carolyn McCall of EasyJet and Bob Dudley of BP.Second, some of the business leaders named say that although Britain would be better off economically in the EU, the UK is still a significant market.Read Kamal's blogThe letter from business leaders said Mr Cameron had secured a commitment from the EU ""to reduce the burden of regulation, deepen the single market and to sign-off crucial international trade deals"".The signatories wrote: ""Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs. Britain will be strong, safer and better off remaining a member of the EU.""John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, denied he had been pressurised into signing the letter, saying his company wanted to get the message across that the EU had ""opened up the aviation market and reduced the cost of flying"".""Lower costs of flying mean we can go on holiday more easily, we can go on business more easily - so whether you are going on a stag night or exporting there is a real benefit of being part of the EU,"" he told the BBC News Channel. Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave.EU, said Downing Street had admitted using taxpayers' money and ""applying pressure"" on FTSE chairmen and chief executives to sign the letter.  ""The truth is that despite the bullying of a prime minister who has no real business experience, it is other normal commercial factors which will determine the continued success of British businesses to invest and grow,"" he said.And Vote Leave, another group campaigning for EU exit said it was ""disappointing to see the prime minister resorting so quickly to trying to scare people into voting for his deal"".A BT spokesman said: ""Any suggestion that our company has been pressured into publicly supporting continued UK membership of a reformed EU is untrue"" and it wanted to inform the public about how the EU benefits its business.Find out where your MP standsMeanwhile, senior figures from both sides of the debate are making their voices heard. Boris Johnson urged people to ignore those ""spreading alarm and anxiety"" about the economic risks of EU exit, saying many of those involved supported the UK joining the euro in the 1990s.""We have a great opportunity now to strike new deals for Britain to be the hub of new trading arrangements around the world,"" he said.Former home secretary Alan Johnson, who is heading Labour's In campaign, has warned that two thirds of British jobs in manufacturing depend on demand from Europe and leaving could put up to 50,000 apprenticeships at risk.""There is no progressive case for Britain to isolate itself,"" he said in a speech in Bristol. ""We need to be leading in Europe, not leaving.""According to BBC research, 142 Tory MPs will campaign to remain in the EU, 120 to leave, while 68 have yet to make their positions clear.Former Conservative leader Lord Hague has warned that splits over Europe in his party could take ""generations to heal"".These divisions were laid bare during a debate in Parliament on Monday, when a succession of Tory MPs questioned the substance of the PM's agreement with EU leaders - announced on Friday.The overwhelming majority of Labour MPs back continued EU membership as do the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats but the Democratic Unionists and UKIP are opposed.

2016-02-23,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria.

2016-02-23,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-23,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday 23 June.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Thanks for sending in your questions here are some of them and our answers:Which MPs are for staying and which are for leaving? The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as in elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn."

2016-02-23,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-23,Stay or go?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35641496,"Much of the discussion we are beginning right now on our membership of the European Union is as clear as mud.The entire debate poses largely unanswerable questions:We can guess at answers - but the guess would be based less on science and more on what our hearts tell us.What is clearer are the groups of people likely to vote to leave and those likely to vote to remain.""The classic stereotypical core Remain voter is a relatively recent university graduate,"" says Prof John Curtice, one of the country's most respected pollsters, based at the University of Strathclyde. ""Maybe some of them actually quite fancy using the freedom-of-movement provisions of the European Union themselves, working in Europe."" I went to speak to students at Essex University, outside Colchester, to test that out.""My biggest concern would be financial,"" said history of art student Daisy, 18, after coming out right away in favour of remaining in the EU. ""I think it's too risky a move especially in the current climate to leave.""That wasn't what I was expecting. I thought she'd emphasise more those perceived cultural benefits of being in a club of 28 different nations. So I turned to her friend Nicky, 20, who is studying philosophy, religion and ethics. ""We should stay in,"" she said.""If America were to see Britain not in the EU, maybe we'd not have as much of a global influence as we do together.""If you look at the chart of voter intention, you'll see the research suggests 18- to 34-year-olds are overwhelmingly likely to vote to stay in. Especially if they have a degree or A-levels. That is understandable. They have a good chance of doing well in the global economy. Though not all of them fit the mould. The third student I spoke to was Theo, 18, doing American studies. ""I think the EU's quite undemocratic,"" he said.""On the other hand, I'm concerned about the economic aspects.""On balance though? ""I'm probably leaning towards leaving,"" he said. Colchester is the first recorded city in Britain, founded following an invasion from across the Channel, when the Romans arrived in 43AD. Among the lanes of city, you find its oldest law firm, Goody Burrett, founded 300 years ago.There's nothing elderly, however, about the 30-something solicitors here, typical of the white-collar workers the analysis suggests will vote in large numbers to stay in the EU. ""The Remain campaign looks very much like a middle-class, professional campaign,"" says Prof Curtice. Trainee solicitor Tim Field told me: ""I'm an in, in Europe, definitely.""Could he be swayed by the ""outers"" argument in the past few days that a UK in the EU was unable to control its own borders? ""The free movement of people was something that concerned me,"" he said.""But that's the advantage of being on an island. We are able to manage the flow of people much better than if we were on mainland Europe.""It was probably my main concern, yet it doesn't really exist."" Zeenat Pasha has also made up her mind.""The arguments for staying in sound more sound to me,"" she said.""It was said if we withdraw, we would have to agree on new trade tariffs that wouldn't be favourable because Germany and France may hold it against us."" Nick Robinson reports - on the groups most likely to vote leaveIs the UK safer in or out?EU referendum - all you need to knowAnother solicitor, Cate Cussell, said: ""I definitely agree. ""[There's] safety in numbers. We are able to band together with the rest of Europe and take on America and Asian markets. That's something we do need to stay a part of."" Roughly a third of people are undecided.One huge factor in persuading voters may be fear. ""If I was single and 21, it would probably be a 'No'. But I'm not,"" says Alex Addison, 38, the client services lead at Fever - a digital marketing company in Colchester. ""I've got a three-year-old son, so it's a 'Yes'. It's the fear of the crash it could have on our economy and our security. There are lots of groups saying it will be fine. But it worries me. It's too much of a risk.""Risk. We've already heard that word a lot in the first few days of the campaign proper. And you'll be hearing it a lot more. It will be a central part of the message put out by the Remain campaign. Yes, they'll champion what they see as the benefits of membership, but they'll ask you to weigh up whether you're prepared to risk those, with a leap into the unknown. There's a risk in staying as well, the Leave campaign counters. The EU has changed so much in the four decades since we joined that we can't guarantee what it will look like in the coming years. How you weigh up those opposing risks will determine the very future of our country.  "
2016-02-23,Does UK import more from EU than it exports?,https://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/web/20160224085529/http://bbc.in/1QAKCHs,
2016-02-23,Just a game...,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35631257,"It was one of the great political upsets of British post-War history. In 1970, Britain's Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was widely expected to hold on to power in a general election he himself had called. But when the voting verdict came in, Mr Wilson found himself being bundled out of Downing Street, and the Conservative leader, Edward Heath, taking his place.  And some sought solace in a simple explanation: football.England had lost a World Cup quarter-final tie just four days before the vote, and this was no ordinary match.Defeat had come at the hands of West Germany, the team England had beaten just four years previously to win the World Cup. And right up until the end of the game, another England victory had seemed on the cards, with the side 2-0 up at half-time. But then three German goals came in, one after the other.""The sense of letdown could not have been greater,"" says Kier Radnedge, who watched the game as a young football reporter. He believes it may well have affected the way some people then voted.""It deflated the mood in the nation,"" he says, ""therefore, they looked for something new. Something new in that case was voting in a new government.""Forty-six years later, the people of Britain will once again be voting in the wake of an international football tie, and that vote could prove more crucial than any individual election. A referendum will decide whether or not the UK should remain a member of the European Union. But just days beforehand, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will play the last of their group matches in the Euro 2016 championships.""If England, Wales or Northern Ireland have won their group, then it will make people feel good about being part of Europe,"" says Mark Perryman, founder of the company Football Philosophy. ""If they come home early, people will ask, 'Do we really want to part of this continent?'""Campaigning in the referendum will not revolve around footballing matters, of course. Debate on EU membership has tended to focus on economic issues, particularly whether a Britain out of the EU would be able to trade as easily with EU member states. Also crucial is immigration, opponents of the EU saying membership allows too many foreigners to live and work in Britain.  Supporters, by contrast, say foreign workers have been a benefit to the UK, not a cost.But Mr Radnedge says too much credence is given to rationality in political argument.""People are swayed by their moods,"" he says about voting. ""It really is a lot to do with how people are feeling on the day."" Mr Radnedge admits the effects of a football match would be marginal, but then marginal votes count in what may be a close-run contest. ""It is illogical, but then people are illogical,"" he says.Whoever wins or loses, the European Championships will certainly compete with the referendum campaign for space on newspaper front pages, and on radio and television news bulletins. And that is not good for the government in this case, according to a former government spin doctor.Charlie Whelan, who served as the press man for Gordon Brown when he was Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, says they always avoided any political event clashing with a major football tie.""You want to control the news agenda as much as you can,"" Mr Whelan says.  ""If you have no idea what's going to happen on any given day, the agenda is set by 22 guys kicking round a football."" But the clash of ballot and ball this June will not represent a completely new mixing of two otherwise-separate fields, because football has always provided an outlet for nationalist passions, and therefore raised questions of nationhood and national identity. The rise of English nationalism was illustrated by England supporters starting to wave the flag of St George, rather than the Union Jack. And the presence of so many European players in British club teams has made supporters question whether they want the best team money can buy, or whether instead fewer foreigners should be allowed on board, in order to nurture more native talent. ""Football clubs are the most European institutions [in Britain],"" Mr Perryman says, ""their players, the managers, the owners, the sponsors. Do supporters like that? Yes - but only if their team is winning."" For more on this story listen to Paul Moss's report on The World Tonight."
2016-02-23,Joshua Rozenberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35630757,"Explaining why he wants the UK to leave the EU, Boris Johnson complained about ""a slow and invisible process of legal colonisation, as the EU infiltrates just about every area of public policy"".There is no doubt that the 28-member EU has come a long way since six European countries founded the European Economic Community in 1958.Their aim was to avoid another devastating war in Europe by making its countries economically interdependent.But what began as a purely economic union has become an organisation responsible for many different areas of policy, from agriculture to transport.At the heart of the EU are laws designed to allow most goods, services, money and people to move freely within EU member states. The European Commission - the EU's administrative arm - is responsible for proposing and drafting EU legislation.If draft proposals are approved by the European Parliament, representing EU citizens, and the Council of Ministers - representing member states - then the proposals become law.The two most common types of EU laws are known as regulations and directives.Regulations have direct and immediate effect within EU member states once they have been brought into effect at EU level.Directives set out an EU objective, which individual countries must transpose into national legislation.The difference can be seen in examples provided by the EU's own website.  When the EU wanted to make sure there were common safeguards on goods imported from outside the EU, it adopted a regulation. When the EU wanted to strengthen rights for consumers across the EU - for example, by eliminating hidden charges and extending the cooling-off period - it adopted a directive. EU law is interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg - or the European Court of Justice, as it used to be called.This is completely separate from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which interprets the European Convention on Human Rights.However, the EU has its own Charter of Fundamental Rights. EU institutions such as the commission, the parliament and the council are legally bound to uphold rights in the charter - as are EU governments whenever they apply EU law.The EU court in Luxembourg interprets EU law to make sure it is applied in the same way in all EU countries and settles legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions. Member states are required to comply with the court's rulings, and may be fined if they do not do so. But there are limits to the EU's powers, of which the most obvious is language.Although a common language would undoubtedly help improve trade there are no plans to impose one across Europe.Nor has the EU tried to change the constitutional structures of its member states.EU summits are attended by presidents, prime ministers and chancellors who lead countries with very different legal systems.All the EU can do is to ensure that its members meet common standards of justice and democracy.The EU's powers to make and enforce laws have a bearing on the UK's sovereignty. When we speak of the sovereignty of Parliament, we mean the right of the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with the formal approval of the monarch - to make any laws Parliament may choose.Parliament can be said to have given up some of its sovereignty when it passed the European Communities Act 1972, enabling the UK to join what was then the European Economic Community, at the beginning of 1973, and requiring courts in the UK to apply EU law.Michael Gove, who also wants to leave the EU, explained at the weekend what he saw as the consequences of EU membership.He said the UK government ""cannot remove or reduce VAT, cannot support a steel plant through troubled times, cannot build the houses we need where they're needed and cannot deport all the individuals who shouldn't be in this country"".But David Cameron took a different view of sovereignty in his interview with Andrew Marr. ""Sovereignty really means: are you able to get things done? Are you able to change things, to fix things? ""You might feel more sovereign, but if you can't get your businesses access to European markets, if you can't keep your people safe… you're less in charge of your destiny.""The prime minister also promised proposals to make clear that Parliament was sovereign. However, his proposals are not expected to include legislation.If Parliament is not already sovereign, then saying so will not change anything; and if Parliament is already sovereign, there seems little point in declaring it.Mr Cameron told Parliament the agreement reached in Brussels last week would give the UK a ""special status"" within the EU and ensure it never became part of a European super-state. However, those who want to leave the EU say the only sovereignty that matters is the ability to make all our laws in the UK.And if that's what sovereignty means, it's difficult to see how it can be achieved while the UK remains part of the EU."
2016-02-23,Safer in v safer out,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35600736,"Is Britain more - or less - at risk of a major terrorist attack if it leaves the EU?It is an important question and the public deserves a straight answer. Yet in the current heated debate it risks being both politicised and blurred by conflation with other issues like the economy, migration and policies towards Russia. So what are the facts?The UK is currently at threat level ""severe"", the second highest on the scale, meaning the government judges a terrorist attack to be ""highly likely"" (but not necessarily imminent). Britain is right up at the top of so-called Islamic State's target list, along with France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. MI5 and police estimate there to be more than 2,000 individuals living here who have sympathies with or connections to international terrorism, most of it IS-inspired. There are two principal reasons why the UK has not yet suffered the sort of Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack (MTFA) experienced twice by Parisians last year. One is better intelligence, the other is better borders. That said, no-one in counter-terrorism circles is being complacent that such an attack could not still happen here.After the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and then again after the London bombings of 2005, Britain's counter-terrorism infrastructure was reformed to break down inter-agency barriers and do away with the sort of departmental ""silos"" that, sadly, still exist in many European nations. So Britain's MI5, the domestic security service, works closely with MI6, the external intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ and the Metropolitan Police. Old rivalries have largely been set aside. Yet in France and Belgium the police and intelligence agencies hardly talk to each other, they share very little. Absurdly, for a Belgian police officer to find out what Belgian intelligence knows about a threat, he or she sometimes needs to learn it from the UK police, who learn it from UK intelligence, who learn it from Belgian intelligence. When it comes to EU-wide counter-terrorism, national intelligence agencies are even less willing to divulge their secrets.On borders, Britain has something that continental European countries do not: A single coastline. British counter-terrorism officials say that because the UK is not part of Europe's Schengen open borders agreement it is considerably more difficult - though not impossible - for terrorists and organised criminals to acquire the sort of powerful automatic weapons, notably Kalashnikovs, used in the Paris attacks last November.A senior EU counter terrorism official admitted to me last year, prior to the migrant crisis, that although the EU's external borders had been strengthened, once weapons had crossed over that border from the Balkans there was little to stop them being moved freely around Europe.The UK's strongest intelligence-sharing and security co-operation relationships are not with Europe, although those still matter. They are with the United States, with its massive eavesdropping and interception capabilities, and the other Anglophone so-called Five Eyes partner nations: Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Nearly all the most important intelligence-sharing with Europe tends to be done bilaterally, country to country, rather than through any EU-wide organisation. Britain also works closely with other partner nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia."
2016-02-23,Europeans' reaction,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35624694,"The UK will vote on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum in June but what do people from other EU countries think about Britain's big decision?David Cameron announced the date of the in/out referendum on Saturday, after returning from Brussels with a deal he argued gave Britain a ""special status"" within the EU.Here, Europeans - who contacted us via email and on Facebook - give their reaction to the referendum being called in the UK and their views on Britain's relationship with the EU.As a Bulgarian, I'm deeply affected by the EU referendum in the UK.More than 50,000 Bulgarians have moved to the UK, searching for work and a better life. Many of them are young and skilled men and women, working hard and paying taxes like everybody else. London is right to seek improvements in the EU.It is hard to create a common EU law without a real political and economic union. That's why I'm against the idea of ever-closer union.There might be some good ideas, such as the EU army, but overall the feeling that it is not the democratically elected national parliament taking the main responsibility for a country's future, but the European Parliament in Strasbourg, is somehow nonsense.The Union is in dire straits right now. There's a variety of different problems: The refugee crisis, lack of economic growth and Russian expansion to the East.And I believe we need Britain as a strong member of the EU, when we address all these issues.My feeling is that countries who do not believe in the values of the EU should leave the union.It will be better for the remaining countries, because only then can they create a real democratic, governed and socially united Europe.I think Mr Cameron is being populist and yet he only speaks with contempt for the EU. Britain should leave the EU for once and for all and then experience what it's like to be a lone country in a global capitalistic market place. Good luck with that. I only feel sad for the people of the UK who will have to suffer from these decisions. I feel the British campaign against the EU is fuelled by hate politics more than ever. It is not a healthy position to take. Goodbye, Britain.I am a French national living in Belgium but prior to moving to Brussels I lived for more than a decade in Southampton and London. For me, Europe is about more than just free trade. It is also about sticking together and preventing another world war. It is about sharing the same democratic values and principles. I feel happy about the deal reached by David Cameron, which stayed within the limits of the EU treaties. I would love to hear more from the UK about the positive changes the EU has brought to Britain, rather than only hearing about seemingly frivolous European laws or hordes of migrants apparently crossing the Channel to exploit British resources. Now it is time for the British people to decide and their decision will have to be respected, of course. I just hope that they decide to stay in the EU. I think that the British people underestimate their culture and in fact how much we rely on them when it comes to values and pragmatism, even if people from other member states don't want to admit it. The potential ""Brexit"" is a very emotional thing to me. What I fear most is that it could unravel with many grave consequences at all levels - social, economic and diplomatic.As a Dutchman and a real European, I would like to see the UK remain a member of the EU. It's better for Europe and also better for Britain. However, I don't want to have a member who receives special treatment. This is the second time the UK has received special treatment, with the last one being under Margaret Thatcher.It should be one rule for all. The other EU members were so weak to accept Cameron's proposals.And yet Mr Cameron then says he doesn't love Brussels, he loves Great Britain. It sounds so childish and unfriendly to the rest of Europe. I think British politicians have made a number of mistakes. Lots of people will certainly agree that the EU is far from perfect and needs reform. Also, a lot of the points your PM raised make sense, like the problem of social benefits. However, British politicians like to talk in public about the EU in a way as if it was an enemy and the other 27 member states were not your friends. The natural consequence was the lack of allies they needed in and before the recent negotiations.I'm often irritated when the British write and talk about Europe as if they were not part of it. This provokes rejection. If you tell me you don't want to have anything to do with the continent, people will say ""ok, then please go away"" and you can hardly count on our support for your matters, even if they make sense.Are you a European with a view on the UK's EU referendum?

2016-02-24,Gove says EU deal 'not legally binding',https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35646004,"Justice Secretary Michael Gove has challenged David Cameron's assertion that his renegotiation deal with EU leaders over UK membership is legally binding - a claim Number 10 denies. Mr Gove - one of five cabinet ministers campaigning for the UK to quit the EU - told the BBC that the European Court of Justice could overturn the changes.But Number 10 said the settlement had ""legal force"".It described it as an ""irreversible International Law Decision"".It cited a former director of legal services at the EU, Alan Dashwood, who said the ""Decision"" was a binding legal agreement reached by consensus and could only be amended or rescinded by consensus - or, ""in other words, with the agreement of the UK"".""So, in that sense, it is irreversible,"" he said.The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowHow the EU worksDoes the EU impact on UK sovereignty?UK and the EU: Better off out or in?Remain v Leave: Where do MPs stand?The EU in 10 objects: The sausageThe PM has previously said the package is ""already legally binding and irreversible"", and could only be overturned by all EU states including the UK.A UK referendum on whether to remain a member of the EU will take place on 23 June.The reform deal paving the way for the referendum promises changes to the EU's binding treaties in two areas - exemption for the UK from an ""ever-closer union"" and protection for countries not using the euro.Mr Gove, a close friend of the PM, told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the facts are that the European Court of Justice is not bound by this agreement until treaties are changed and we don't know when that will be"".He said Mr Cameron was ""absolutely right that this is a deal between 28 nations all of whom believe it"", adding: ""But the whole point about the European Court of Justice is that it stands above the nation states.""Mr Cameron has ""not been misleading anyone"", Mr Gove went on, but he added: ""I do think it's important that people also realise that the European Court of Justice stands above every nation state, and ultimately it will decide on the basis of the treaties and this deal is not yet in the treaties.""Analysis: 'Europe could throw out the changes'By BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergMr Gove's comments will be catnip for eurosceptics who've already been arguing that Mr Cameron's deal is hardly worth the paper its written on.For David Cameron, maintaining the sense that the deal he's achieved can and will improve the UK's relationship with the rest of the European Union in a meaningful way is a vital part of his campaign.It's one thing Tories from different parts, different generations of the party, disagreeing. It's quite another when it is two who have shared political hopes, ambition, and even family holidays.Read more from LauraOn Monday, Mr Cameron told MPs: ""The reforms that we have secured will be legally binding in international law, and will be deposited as a treaty at the United Nations.""They cannot be unpicked without the agreement of Britain and every other EU country.""Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said the guarantee that the UK would be exempted from ever-closer union would be ""written exactly"" into the treaties in the form it was agreed last week.""Nobody can tell British voters other things,"" he told the BBC's Hard Talk programme. The package negotiated by David Cameron also includes a reduction in the amount of child benefit EU migrants can claim for children living overseas, and an ""emergency brake"" on their in-work benefits.A ""red card"" system allowing national parliaments to club together against unwanted EU legislation was also agreed.Ministers who want to quit the EU have been allowed special dispensation to oppose the government at the referendum, although strict rules have been put in place for the campaign.In the BBC interview, his first since deciding to oppose Mr Cameron in the referendum, Mr Gove also said a vote to leave the EU would offer ""a tremendous opportunity for Britain to recover its mojo"", calling the union an ""old-fashioned model"".Elsewhere in the EU referendum debate, 13 senior military officers have signed a letter to the Daily Telegraph saying being in the EU ""helps us to safeguard our people, our prosperity and our way of life"".The signatories include Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a Normandy veteran and former chief of the defence staff, and Lord Dannatt, who was chief of the defence staff until 2009.The letter says Nato is ""the most important alliance for maintaining Britain's national security"", but adds that EU membership is another ""increasingly important pillar of our security""."

The study author, Domenico Pagano, refused to corroborate Mr Hunt's use of the figures, saying: ""It will be inaccurate and counterproductive to quote that our analysis is due to be published in the BMJ shortly, as this is not the case and may seem to interfere with the peer review process.""When finally published in September 2015, the research actually suggested there were 11,000 excess deaths per year as a result of the ""weekend effect"" - although the authors pointed out this could not be proven to be linked to staffing levels.A separate string of emails seen by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act shows officials at Whitehall and NHS England then backtracked, using a combination of figures already in the public domain from 2009 and 2012 to attempt to provide an explanation for the 6,000 excess deaths claim. NHS England then published this in a ""low-key fashion"" on their website on 6 August.One official at the Department of Health wrote to another at NHS England explaining the fudge, saying: ""I am keen to avoid undue criticism of either [the Department of Health] or NHS England'.NHS England has now admitted Mr Hunt had had advance sight of ""headline figures"" of the BMJ study prior to it being accepted for publication. A spokesman said NHS medical director for England Sir Bruce Keogh and one of the study's authors alongside Dr Pagano, had shared some findings with ""interested parties"" including the Department of Health and the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB).This is despite NHS England's Freedom of Information Officer saying in October last year: ""Sir Bruce Keogh did not discuss the study's findings with anyone at the Department of Health at any point before or after the publication of this article.""NHS England now says this October statement is ""clearly a mistake, and absurd"" and Sir Bruce is ""devastated"" the focus has now shifted from ""the issues of patient safety"".NHS England said: ""The data on this topic has been consistent and it cannot be dismissed or ignored.  ""We make no apology for using data and analysis to inform NHS and government policy in the best interests of patients.""A Department of Health spokesman said: ""This 6,000 figure was NHS England's analysis. Subsequent independent clinical studies have shown further variation in the quality of care across the week, and more recent analysis makes clear there could actually be as many as 11,000 excess deaths owing to the 'weekend effect'.""Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said: ""This is an extremely serious state of affairs given the weight attached to these figures by the health secretary in justifying changes to junior doctors' contracts.""Rather than admitting the source of the figures, it seems that civil servants had to cobble together a post-hoc rationalisation for Jeremy Hunt's sound bites.""There now needs to be a full investigation about whether pressure was put upon officials and whether the health secretary was involved."""
2016-02-24,Holyrood 'could get new powers early',https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35646303,"Claims that new powers could be devolved to Holyrood earlier than anticipated have been dismissed by Scotland's finance secretary.John Swinney was responding to the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, who said some of the new powers could be in place shortly after May's election. But Mr Swinney accused Mr Mundell of a ""leap of imagination"". The Scottish and UK government agreed a deal on the so-called fiscal framework on Tuesday. The framework sets out how the block-grant that the Scottish government receives from Westminster would be altered to take account of new powers over areas such as income tax and VAT that are being devolved under the Scotland Bill. It had been seen as the last major stumbling block to the Scotland Bill being devolved, with the general expectation being that the new powers would come into force next year. Mr Mundell told Holyrood's devolution committee on Tuesday that he expected control over income tax to pass to MSPs by April 2017,  in time for the next budget of the new Scottish Parliament.But he anticipated that a number of the other new powers ""will be in place almost immediately after the Scottish Parliament elections"".He added: ""One of the other tax powers for example, Air Passenger Duty, can be transferred at the point that the Scottish government has its model ready for that transfer. ""If the arrangements are available shortly after the Scottish Parliament election we would be able to transfer them.""In relation to the wider powers and the wider tax, we place no impediment in relation to the transfer of those powers.""However, speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said he did not agree with Mr Mundell's assessment.He said: ""The whole devolution process cannot commence until we have put in place distinctive legislation within Scotland. ""To see that coming earlier than 2017 - and even 2017 strikes me as being quite early - is quite a leap of imagination.""Mr Swinney said that the Smith Commission recommendations and ""many elements"" of the Vow on new powers made by the three main UK party leaders ahead of the independence referendum had now been delivered.But he said Gordon Brown's promise that something ""near federalism"" would be delivered if Scots rejected independence had still not been fulfilled. And he denied that the fiscal framework was a ""trap"" set by the Treasury, adding: ""It could have been a trap if I'd fallen for it but I didn't"".Mr Mundell is expected to give more details of the fiscal agreement to the House of Commons later.Talks over the fiscal framework, which began in March of last year, had stalled over different interpretations of a key line of the Smith Commission agreement, which said there should be ""no detriment"" to either the UK or Scottish budgets as a result of the changes.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the deal, reached after 10 rounds of negotiations, meant ""not a single penny of detriment to the Scottish government's budget"" for six years, followed by a review of future arrangements. Chancellor George Osborne said the agreements were ""fair to Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK"".Lord Smith of Kelvin, who chaired the cross-party Smith Commission set up after the ""No"" vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, said the deal on new powers for Holyrood could now be ""delivered in full"". He said: ""The next term of Scottish parliamentarians will be debating and taking decisions over large parts of Scotland's tax and welfare policy. I believe this will be transformational for our parliament.""There should be no doubt that this was a highly complex package of measures to agree. It is difficult to imagine a bigger test of inter-governmental relationships and while it was obviously a very tough negotiation, what matters is that an agreement was reached. ""This provides an excellent basis for constructive engagement between the governments long into the future. ""When the Smith Agreement was passed to the prime minister and first minister, both gave their word that they would deliver it into law - they have met that promise in full."""
2016-02-24,Deal agreed for Scottish funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35641714,"The Scottish and UK governments have reached a financial deal enabling new powers for Holyrood.Negotiations over the fiscal framework have been going on since March 2015, with a lengthy deadlock over the issue of Scotland's block grant.Confirming a deal had been done, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said ""not a single penny"" would be taken from the Scottish government's budget.Details of the deal will be published soon so Holyrood scrutiny can begin.The deal, which is the financial basis for new powers to be devolved as part of the Scotland Bill, was settled after Chancellor George Osborne spoke to Ms Sturgeon on the phone.He said the agreement created a ""stronger Scotland in a stronger UK"".The MP told the BBC: ""It delivers on the vow we made to the people of Scotland.""It is fair to the taxpayers of all of the UK and it gives Scotland one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.""Ms Sturgeon and Finance Secretary John Swinney had earlier informed MSPs that there was only one issue outstanding in the talks, the substance of a five-year review of the agreement.The two sides had disputed a key line of the Smith Commission agreement on new powers, which said there should be ""no detriment"" to either the UK or Scottish budgets as a result of the deal.Ms Sturgeon said the deal agreed would see ""not a single penny of detriment"" now or ""at any point in the future"".Addressing parliament, she added: ""There is now an agreement in principle that we can recommend to parliament.""There will be not a single penny of detriment to the Scottish government's budget as a result of the devolution of powers during the transition period, for the next six years to March 2022.""She paid tribute to Mr Swinney over his role in the protracted negotiations, saying it had been much ""harder work than it should have been"" to stop the Treasury from carrying out a ""cash grab"" from Scottish budgets.Prime Minister David Cameron said it was ""a significant day of devolution"", which would deliver a ""powerhouse parliament"" in Scotland.He added: ""We have reached a deal which is fair to Scotland and fair to the whole of the UK. ""It delivers accountability to the Scottish government and transforms politics in Scotland. It means May's Holyrood elections can be fought on the issues which matter most: how the Scottish government should use these extensive new powers, rather than what they are.""I welcome this agreement which shows that Scotland's two governments can work constructively together for the benefit of Scottish people.""Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale welcomed the deal, saying it was ""a historic moment for Scotland"". Her party had backed the Scottish government's position in the negotiations.She said: ""Scottish politics will never be the same again thanks to these new powers. We have entered a new and exciting era of devolution.""Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, who later gave evidence to the devolution committee on the matter, said he was ""very pleased"" that a deal had been reached.He insisted he had ""always been confident"" an agreement would be reached because both the UK and Scottish governments had wanted what was best for Scotland and the whole of the UK.The final sticking point in the talks revolved around how Scotland's block grant from Westminster would be reduced in light of new fundraising powers being devolved as part of the Scotland Bill.Scotland's population is projected to grow more slowly than that of the UK's in the coming years, and the two parties disagreed over how to balance out the financial impact of this after the first five years of the deal.A compromise was reached on how this would work for the first five years. However, if no deal could be reached at the review, the UK government wanted to revert to the original proposal, which Ms Sturgeon described as Scotland bearing the brunt of ""population driven detriment"".The new deal will see the review carried out without any prior expectation of Scotland taking on an extra financial burden, and an independent study would be carried out to inform that process."
2016-02-24,Aston Martin creates 750 jobs in Wales,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-35640339,"Aston Martin is to build its new luxury car in south Wales, creating 750 highly-skilled jobs.The DBX Concept car will be hand-made in a super hangar at St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan.It is a major coup for Wales, which took two years to secure the deal ahead of 20 locations across the world.As well as attracting one of motoring's most prestigious names, it is expected to create around 1,000 jobs with suppliers and local business.Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer called it a ""momentous day for Wales"" at a news conference in Cardiff on Wednesday.The development will include a skills academy, which will make St Athan and the Vale of Glamorgan a centre of excellence.Work on the factory will start in 2017 and production will start three years later. ""We have a wealth of craftsmanship here,"" said Mr Palmer. ""It takes 200 hours to make a car and to do that we need skilled labour and we have got that skilled labour in Wales, in Great Britain and that played a big part in our decision.""The company is also bringing more work to its factory and headquarters at Gaydon in Warwickshire bringing the total of jobs created to 1,000.The value of the deal is in the hundreds of millions of pounds, although the Welsh government will not comment on the amount of support it is giving.Mr Palmer said there were a number of reasons why St Athan had been chosen for the new site.""The Welsh offer wasn't financially enticing but share holders had to understand the balance that had to be made on quality, cost and time, and St Athan was on time,"" he said.""We don't have to build a building.  It won through in terms of quality of workforce and supplies and relationship with the government of Wales.""In its 103-year history Aston Martin has only sold just over 70,000 cars.To continue to survive at the luxury end of the market it has been looking at broadening its range to appeal to younger - and female - customers.The car - which is an all-electric 4x4 and expected to cost at least £160,000 to buy - was unveiled at the Geneva motor show last year.Mr Palmer said then that the company envisaged a world ""perhaps a world not too far away, when luxury GT travel is not only stylish and luxurious but also more practical, more family-friendly and more environmentally responsible"".The design team had in mind a driver who was a young woman, American - and rich. The fictitious customer was dubbed Charlotte and seen as ""an attractive lady, cool, in her 30s"". First Minister Carwyn Jones said it was the start of a long-term relationship between Wales and Aston Martin.""We will work together in building on the strong foundations of our partnership to nurture a prosperous and rewarding future for this iconic company and its skilled workforce in Wales,"" he said.Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb called the announcement an ""enormous boost"" for Wales and the British car industry.He added: ""It is a genuine example of a 'one nation' achievement, with both the UK and Welsh governments working together to attract this prestige manufacturer to Welsh shores.""Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Mr Palmer said the company had chosen Wales because it was ""the best offer"".""I don't simply mean in terms of money. What really swung it was the passion and the professionalism of the people we dealt with in Wales,"" he said.Economy Minister Edwina Hart AM said: ""We had an excellent relationship with Aston Martin at official and ministerial level.""The important thing for us was ensuring that Aston Martin stayed in the UK, a fine company for the UK.""We fought very hard to ensure we were on the list and now we've achieved having it.""This is a win not just for Wales but for the UK.""ASTON MARTIN THROUGH THE YEARSA GEAR CHANGE FOR THE WELSH CAR INDUSTRYMrs Hart called it a ""significant moment in the history of the automotive sector in Wales"". Indeed, for the Welsh car industry this is a tremendous pat on the back.It will also put it at the forefront of developing eco-friendly performance vehicles.Apart from the short-lived Gilbern in the 1960s and early 1970s, whole cars have not been made in Wales before.But there are 150 companies in Wales making car components, employing 18,000 workers and with a combined turnover of £3.3bn.Some already make parts for Aston Martin but these are relatively few. But there are many others which already supply Jaguar, Land Rover, Ford and Honda - a record Aston Martin will have taken notice of. After the announcement, there was disappointment in other areas - including the West Midlands - which had failed to land the deal.The company said it was not just about money but it was ""consistently impressed with the focus on quality, cost and speed from the Welsh government team"". Wales' status as a maker of parts for car assembly plants beyond its borders is about to change - and with style. Think Aston Martin and you think James Bond, glamorous women and a sense of cool and from 2020, Wales will be part of that world too. "
2016-02-24,Privately educated 'dominate top jobs',https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35641061,"Leading British actors are more than twice as likely as stars in the music industry to have attended fee-paying schools, the Sutton Trust says.It also says professions like politics and the law continue to be dominated by privately educated Oxbridge graduates.The Trust said a child's chances of reaching the top still came down to their schooling and contacts.The government said the state sector was increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment. Researchers for the Trust, which campaigns for greater social mobility, looked at the educational backgrounds of more than 1,200 people, working in high positions in medicine, the law, the military, journalism, politics, the civil service, business, film and pop music.They also looked at Nobel Prize-winners.The report - Leading People 2016 - found that more than two in five (42%) of British Bafta winners went to a private school, compared with around a fifth (19%) of those who have been awarded a Brit music award.Also, two-thirds (67%) of British Oscar winners were privately educated, among them Eddie Redmayne, who went to Eton, and Kate Winslet, who studied at Redroofs Theatre School.The Sutton Trust suggested the successful state-funded BRIT school in Croydon, which counts Adele and Jessie J among its former pupils, may be one reason why the proportion of state-educated top music stars is higher.The research found that three-quarters (74%) of the UK's top judges went to a fee-paying school, and nearly eight in 10 (78%) went on to Oxford or Cambridge University.Among top military personnel, some seven in 10 (71%) were educated in the private sector, although just 14% were Oxbridge educated.Slightly more than half of leading print journalists and solicitors (51% each) attended fee-paying schools.Just over half (54%) of these journalists attended Oxford or Cambridge, along with 55% of solicitors and 51% of the senior civil servants included in the study.In politics, half the Cabinet were privately educated (including old Etonian Prime Minister David Cameron) compared with 13% of the shadow cabinet, and around a third (32%) of MPs.The current Cabinet does have fewer former independent school pupils than the coalition cabinet of 2010, the report notes, but slightly more than Tony Blair's post-election Cabinet in 2005.Just under half (47%) of the current cabinet are Oxbridge graduates, along with 32% of the shadow cabinet.The trust said that of the country's top doctors, 61% were educated at independent schools, nearly one-quarter at grammar schools (22%) and the remainder (16%) at comprehensives. The private school sector educates 7% of the population.""The top of many of the UK's most prestigious professions remain disproportionately constituted by those with elite educational and socio-economic backgrounds,"" the study says.Sutton Trust research fellow Dr Philip Kirby, who wrote the report, said: ""Young people from more advantaged backgrounds often have broader professional social networks, which can be used to access certain jobs, as well as parents who might be more able to support them through unpaid internships, which are increasingly important for career development.""Chairman of the Sutton Trust Sir Peter Lampl said: ""Our research shows that your chances of reaching the top in so many areas of British life are very much greater if you went to an independent school. ""As well as academic achievement, an independent education tends to develop essential skills such as confidence, articulacy and team work which are vital to career success.""The key to improving social mobility at the top is to open up independent schools to all pupils based on merit not money as demonstrated by our successful Open Access scheme, as well as support for highly able students in state schools.""A  spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""Thanks to our reforms - which are underpinned by a total commitment to social justice - 1.4 million more pupils and counting are being taught in good or outstanding state schools than in 2010. ""As the independent Good Schools Guide has recognised - the state sector is increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment and learning environment.""University entrants are at an all-time high, with rising numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university and the number of disadvantaged students attending Russell Group universities doubling since 2010. ""We are determined to spread this educational excellence everywhere, extending true social mobility for all. We are continuing the pupil premium at current rates for the duration of this parliament."""
2016-02-24,City region's 'internet coast' vision,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-35631354,"Creating an ""internet coast"" in south west Wales to drive the digital future of energy, technology and healthcare is at the heart of a £500m city deal plan.Swansea Bay City Region's chairman Sir Terry Matthews aims to transform these sectors in the same way the internet changed telecom.The blueprint is to create up to 33,000 jobs over the next 20 years.A fibre-optic transatlantic cable from New York to Oxwich Bay would be a ""game changer"" to bring ultrafast broadband.The city region has decided to go for something distinctive and ambitious in its vision - not based on physical infrastructure or huge transport projects.It concedes that south west Wales is underachieving economically and also needs to be resilient, particularly with the difficulties being faced by big employers like Tata Steel at Port Talbot.Those behind it say they want to ""punch above our weight"" and offer something of importance to the UK, as well as developing something different to what other city deals are offering.South west Wales would in essence become a giant test bed for internet and digital innovation.The bid has been analysed by Cardiff University and it is estimated the economic potential could see 33,000 jobs created over 20 years - worth £3.3bn in output.The four local councils in the city region are looking at a £100m commitment over 20 years, with contributions from the private sector, higher education and European Union.The negotiations for the fibre-optic link from north America is understood to be at an advanced stage and would bring the ultra-fast broadband speeds to west Wales first, enabling towns along the coast to benefit.In a letter to Chancellor George Osborne, Sir Terry - who made his millions in internet developments of the telecom industry - said the vision addressed global challenges and was of a sufficient scale to attract international investors.""The prosperity gap between Swansea Bay and the rest of Wales and the UK remains stubbornly and unacceptably high.""Real transformation will not be achieved by simply doing more of the same."""
2016-02-24,No civil service help for exit ministers,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35642296,"Civil servants have been banned from helping ministers make the case for leaving the EU, prompting claims the establishment is lined up against them.Michael Gove and other ministers campaigning for Britain's exit will also be unable to use official briefings to prepare campaign speeches.But civil servants will be allowed to help ministers arguing for Britain to ""remain in a reformed EU"", No 10 said.UKIP described the move as a ""total stitch-up"".The rule change was announced by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood.Downing Street said civil servants and special advisers should not give ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU access to government papers, apart from ones they have already seen, on the referendum or David Cameron's EU renegotiations.But officials should continue to support the ministers in all other aspects of government business in their normal way, a spokesman added.The Conservative Party is officially neutral in the referendum but the government's official policy is that Britain should remain in the EU - and civil servants are duty bound to support government policies.But leave campaigners are likely to argue the move will give the remain campaign an unfair advantage on 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EU.I know of one cabinet minister backing Leave who has chosen to get round all this by bringing in an old friend to act as an unofficial special adviser for the duration.Other special advisers have been less certain of the rules and have been asking Downing Street what they should be doing. One told me: ""We are all rather feeling our way on this.""In truth, Whitehall is not too worried about how the cabinet will operate in the run-up to June 23. This is, after all, a civil service that has had to deal with a coalition government for the last five years and that had a cabinet that was nothing if not divided.But government is going to be a little edgy in coming months.Read more from JamesNorthern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, one of five cabinet ministers to join the leave campaign, said it was another example of the forces against them.""The leave campaign is the underdog, no doubt about that. Much of the establishment is lined up in favour of EU membership, as they have been in the past,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. The cabinet is split over the issue with 17 full members in favour of staying in the EU and five wanting to leave. Conservative MPs are also split - 142 to 120 at the latest count in favour of staying. David Cameron said on Tuesday he though London mayor Boris Johnson ""has got this one wrong"" by being in favour of the UK leaving the EU.In a letter outlining the changes to the civil service code, Sir Jeremy said: ""Civil servants can draft ministerial speeches and provide briefing on government policy for ministers... including those organised by groups campaigning for the same outcome as the government on the EU referendum."" It says ministers will ""be able to take a different personal position from that of the Government on the issue of the EU referendum.""But it adds: ""This wholly exceptional arrangement applies only to the question of whether the UK should remain in a reformed EU or leave. All other EU or EU-related business, including negotiations in or with all EU institutions and other Member States, and debates and votes in the UK Parliament on EU business will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility and party discipline.""The rules will apply until 28 days before the referendum, when they will be reviewed, he added.UKIP MEP Nathan Gill said Whitehall's approach represented an ""appalling cover-up"" and that people should know what contingency plans the government has made for a UK exit from the EU.""To not give the public that information in order that they can make an informed decision on such a huge issue is the greatest insult to democracy,"" he added.Elsewhere in the EU referendum debate, former prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC a vote to leave could change the future of the UK by ""providing the justification for Scottish independence"", warning this would be a ""huge mistake for the country"".Mr Blair said he supported Mr Cameron in making the case for a vote to remain, saying the PM had achieved a ""great deal"" in his negotiations."

Lord Lawson then joked: ""I would be very happy if the Republic of Ireland - I don't think it's going to happen - were to say we made a mistake in getting independence in 1922, and come back within the United Kingdom. That would be great.""When asked if a UK withdrawal from the EU would result the reinstatement of security checks along the Irish border, he said: ""There are checks now because of the terrorist problem. ""That's one of the places where terrorists are checked. I'm not at all sure there needs to be anything further. I don't see why there should be.""However, earlier this week Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness warned the implications of a UK withdrawal from the EU would be ""absolutely enormous"" for Northern Ireland.His Sinn Féin party, which is campaigning to stay in the EU, said an exit would ""undoubtedly led to a reinforcement of the border and greater restrictions on the movement of people, livestock and goods from one part of this island to the other""."

Sir Bernard told MPs that suspects such as Lord Bramall had to wait to be told about the outcome of his case until the police and Crown Prosecution Service had completed their work.He also defended the decision to send 22 officers to search Lord Bramall's home during the investigation into the abuse allegations.Sir Bernard expressed ""regret"" for the effect of the inquiry on Lord Bramall but repeatedly refused to apologise at the parliamentary committee.During one exchange, Conservative MP Tim Loughton referred to a ""media circus"" surrounding the case.Sir Bernard said: ""Ah the media circus. If what you mean is that you want me to be bullied into apologising then that won't happen.""Mr Loughton replied: ""So you think you're being bullied, do you?""Sir Bernard said: ""I'm asking you whether that's what you think.""Lord Bramall, a Normandy veteran who retired from the House of Lords in 2013, previously told the BBC there was not ""one grain of truth"" in the allegations, made against him by a man in his 40s.Lord Bramall served during the D-Day landings during World War Two and commanded UK land forces between 1976 and 1978.The peer became chief of the general staff - the professional head of the Army - in 1979, and in 1982 he oversaw the Falklands campaign.Later that year he became chief of the defence staff - the most senior officer commanding the UK's armed forces."
2016-02-24,Big firms warn EU exit 'threatens jobs',https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35636838,"Leaving the European Union would threaten jobs and put the UK's economy at risk, leaders of some of Britain's biggest companies have said.Bosses - including those of BT, Marks & Spencer and Vodafone - signed a letter published in the Times, saying an EU exit would deter investment in the UK.Leave campaigners point out two-thirds of FTSE 100 firms, including Tesco and Sainsbury, did not back the letter.A referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU will be held on 23 June.David Cameron earlier took questions from employees of mobile phone giant O2, one of the signatories of the letter, at its headquarters in Slough, on the first of a series of tour events to sell his pro-EU message to voters. The move is designed to reach beyond Westminster and the emerging divisions within the Tory party. The Mayor of London Boris Johnson, the most high-profile politician to back EU exit, has urged people to focus on the issues and played down talk of ill feeling between him and the PM, saying ""team spirit"" within the party was good.In a move described by No 10 as ""unprecedented"", chairmen or chief executives of 36 FTSE 100 companies signed the letter, organised by Stronger in Europe and Downing Street, backing the campaign to stay in the EU, including Burberry, BAE Systems and EasyJet. The FTSE bosses were among a total of 198 signatories from the business world, including the chief executives of Heathrow and Gatwick airports.However, nearly two-thirds of the UK's largest publicly listed businesses did not sign, including RBS and Barclays.Asked about why the majority of FTSE 100 companies did not sign the letter, Mr Cameron said companies were often reluctant to ""make any form of political statement"".But he added: ""If the leave campaign could produce 35 business leaders of this sort of stature they'd be over the moon and I don't think they have the prospect of doing that with FTSE 100 leaders in any way.""On Boris Johnson's decision to campaign against him, the prime minister said he had ""huge respect"" for the London Mayor and he had ""great future in British politics"" but added: ""He has got it wrong on this one.""Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has meanwhile, said policymakers are ""not making a judgment"" on the outcome or consequences of the referendum.Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that the Bank was treating the June vote as it would ""every other political event"".Analysis by the BBC's business editor Kamal AhmedFor politicians supporting Britain remaining in the European Union, the blessing of business leaders is seen as a positive step.And the list signing the pro-European letter - at least in part orchestrated by Number 10 - are certainly a hefty bunch. But a few health warnings.First, many of the people who have signed have long been public advocates of Britain remaining in the EU. These include Sir Roger Carr of BAE, Iain Conn of Centrica, Dame Carolyn McCall of EasyJet and Bob Dudley of BP.Second, some of the business leaders named say that although Britain would be better off economically in the EU, the UK is still a significant market.Read Kamal's blogThe letter from business leaders said Mr Cameron had secured a commitment from the EU ""to reduce the burden of regulation, deepen the single market and to sign-off crucial international trade deals"".The signatories wrote: ""Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs. Britain will be strong, safer and better off remaining a member of the EU.""John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, denied he had been pressurised into signing the letter, saying his company wanted to get the message across that the EU had ""opened up the aviation market and reduced the cost of flying"".""Lower costs of flying mean we can go on holiday more easily, we can go on business more easily - so whether you are going on a stag night or exporting there is a real benefit of being part of the EU,"" he told the BBC News Channel. Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave.EU, said Downing Street had admitted using taxpayers' money and ""applying pressure"" on FTSE chairmen and chief executives to sign the letter.  ""The truth is that despite the bullying of a prime minister who has no real business experience, it is other normal commercial factors which will determine the continued success of British businesses to invest and grow,"" he said.And Vote Leave, another group campaigning for EU exit said it was ""disappointing to see the prime minister resorting so quickly to trying to scare people into voting for his deal"".A BT spokesman said: ""Any suggestion that our company has been pressured into publicly supporting continued UK membership of a reformed EU is untrue"" and it wanted to inform the public about how the EU benefits its business.Find out where your MP standsMeanwhile, senior figures from both sides of the debate are making their voices heard. Boris Johnson urged people to ignore those ""spreading alarm and anxiety"" about the economic risks of EU exit, saying many of those involved supported the UK joining the euro in the 1990s.""We have a great opportunity now to strike new deals for Britain to be the hub of new trading arrangements around the world,"" he said.Former home secretary Alan Johnson, who is heading Labour's In campaign, has warned that two thirds of British jobs in manufacturing depend on demand from Europe and leaving could put up to 50,000 apprenticeships at risk.""There is no progressive case for Britain to isolate itself,"" he said in a speech in Bristol. ""We need to be leading in Europe, not leaving.""According to BBC research, 142 Tory MPs will campaign to remain in the EU, 120 to leave, while 68 have yet to make their positions clear.Former Conservative leader Lord Hague has warned that splits over Europe in his party could take ""generations to heal"".These divisions were laid bare during a debate in Parliament on Monday, when a succession of Tory MPs questioned the substance of the PM's agreement with EU leaders - announced on Friday.The overwhelming majority of Labour MPs back continued EU membership as do the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats but the Democratic Unionists and UKIP are opposed.

2016-02-24,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

2016-02-24,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-24,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday 23 June.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Thanks for sending in your questions here are some of them and our answers:Which MPs are for staying and which are for leaving? The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as in elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn."

2016-02-24,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-24,Stay or go?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35641496,"Much of the discussion we are beginning right now on our membership of the European Union is as clear as mud.The entire debate poses largely unanswerable questions:We can guess at answers - but the guess would be based less on science and more on what our hearts tell us.What is clearer are the groups of people likely to vote to leave and those likely to vote to remain.""The classic stereotypical core Remain voter is a relatively recent university graduate,"" says Prof John Curtice, one of the country's most respected pollsters, based at the University of Strathclyde. ""Maybe some of them actually quite fancy using the freedom-of-movement provisions of the European Union themselves, working in Europe."" I went to speak to students at Essex University, outside Colchester, to test that out.""My biggest concern would be financial,"" said history of art student Daisy, 18, after coming out right away in favour of remaining in the EU. ""I think it's too risky a move especially in the current climate to leave.""That wasn't what I was expecting. I thought she'd emphasise more those perceived cultural benefits of being in a club of 28 different nations. So I turned to her friend Nicky, 20, who is studying philosophy, religion and ethics. ""We should stay in,"" she said.""If America were to see Britain not in the EU, maybe we'd not have as much of a global influence as we do together.""If you look at the chart of voter intention, you'll see the research suggests 18- to 34-year-olds are overwhelmingly likely to vote to stay in. Especially if they have a degree or A-levels. That is understandable. They have a good chance of doing well in the global economy. Though not all of them fit the mould. The third student I spoke to was Theo, 18, doing American studies. ""I think the EU's quite undemocratic,"" he said.""On the other hand, I'm concerned about the economic aspects.""On balance though? ""I'm probably leaning towards leaving,"" he said. Colchester is the first recorded city in Britain, founded following an invasion from across the Channel, when the Romans arrived in 43AD. Among the lanes of city, you find its oldest law firm, Goody Burrett, founded 300 years ago.There's nothing elderly, however, about the 30-something solicitors here, typical of the white-collar workers the analysis suggests will vote in large numbers to stay in the EU. ""The Remain campaign looks very much like a middle-class, professional campaign,"" says Prof Curtice. Trainee solicitor Tim Field told me: ""I'm an in, in Europe, definitely.""Could he be swayed by the ""outers"" argument in the past few days that a UK in the EU was unable to control its own borders? ""The free movement of people was something that concerned me,"" he said.""But that's the advantage of being on an island. We are able to manage the flow of people much better than if we were on mainland Europe.""It was probably my main concern, yet it doesn't really exist."" Zeenat Pasha has also made up her mind.""The arguments for staying in sound more sound to me,"" she said.""It was said if we withdraw, we would have to agree on new trade tariffs that wouldn't be favourable because Germany and France may hold it against us."" Nick Robinson reports - on the groups most likely to vote leaveIs the UK safer in or out?EU referendum - all you need to knowAnother solicitor, Cate Cussell, said: ""I definitely agree. ""[There's] safety in numbers. We are able to band together with the rest of Europe and take on America and Asian markets. That's something we do need to stay a part of."" Roughly a third of people are undecided.One huge factor in persuading voters may be fear. ""If I was single and 21, it would probably be a 'No'. But I'm not,"" says Alex Addison, 38, the client services lead at Fever - a digital marketing company in Colchester. ""I've got a three-year-old son, so it's a 'Yes'. It's the fear of the crash it could have on our economy and our security. There are lots of groups saying it will be fine. But it worries me. It's too much of a risk.""Risk. We've already heard that word a lot in the first few days of the campaign proper. And you'll be hearing it a lot more. It will be a central part of the message put out by the Remain campaign. Yes, they'll champion what they see as the benefits of membership, but they'll ask you to weigh up whether you're prepared to risk those, with a leap into the unknown. There's a risk in staying as well, the Leave campaign counters. The EU has changed so much in the four decades since we joined that we can't guarantee what it will look like in the coming years. How you weigh up those opposing risks will determine the very future of our country.  "
2016-02-24,Does UK import more from EU than it exports?,https://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/web/20160224085529/http://bbc.in/1QAKCHs,
2016-02-24,Just a game...,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35631257,"It was one of the great political upsets of British post-War history. In 1970, Britain's Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was widely expected to hold on to power in a general election he himself had called. But when the voting verdict came in, Mr Wilson found himself being bundled out of Downing Street, and the Conservative leader, Edward Heath, taking his place.  And some sought solace in a simple explanation: football.England had lost a World Cup quarter-final tie just four days before the vote, and this was no ordinary match.Defeat had come at the hands of West Germany, the team England had beaten just four years previously to win the World Cup. And right up until the end of the game, another England victory had seemed on the cards, with the side 2-0 up at half-time. But then three German goals came in, one after the other.""The sense of letdown could not have been greater,"" says Kier Radnedge, who watched the game as a young football reporter. He believes it may well have affected the way some people then voted.""It deflated the mood in the nation,"" he says, ""therefore, they looked for something new. Something new in that case was voting in a new government.""Forty-six years later, the people of Britain will once again be voting in the wake of an international football tie, and that vote could prove more crucial than any individual election. A referendum will decide whether or not the UK should remain a member of the European Union. But just days beforehand, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will play the last of their group matches in the Euro 2016 championships.""If England, Wales or Northern Ireland have won their group, then it will make people feel good about being part of Europe,"" says Mark Perryman, founder of the company Football Philosophy. ""If they come home early, people will ask, 'Do we really want to part of this continent?'""Campaigning in the referendum will not revolve around footballing matters, of course. Debate on EU membership has tended to focus on economic issues, particularly whether a Britain out of the EU would be able to trade as easily with EU member states. Also crucial is immigration, opponents of the EU saying membership allows too many foreigners to live and work in Britain.  Supporters, by contrast, say foreign workers have been a benefit to the UK, not a cost.But Mr Radnedge says too much credence is given to rationality in political argument.""People are swayed by their moods,"" he says about voting. ""It really is a lot to do with how people are feeling on the day."" Mr Radnedge admits the effects of a football match would be marginal, but then marginal votes count in what may be a close-run contest. ""It is illogical, but then people are illogical,"" he says.Whoever wins or loses, the European Championships will certainly compete with the referendum campaign for space on newspaper front pages, and on radio and television news bulletins. And that is not good for the government in this case, according to a former government spin doctor.Charlie Whelan, who served as the press man for Gordon Brown when he was Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, says they always avoided any political event clashing with a major football tie.""You want to control the news agenda as much as you can,"" Mr Whelan says.  ""If you have no idea what's going to happen on any given day, the agenda is set by 22 guys kicking round a football."" But the clash of ballot and ball this June will not represent a completely new mixing of two otherwise-separate fields, because football has always provided an outlet for nationalist passions, and therefore raised questions of nationhood and national identity. The rise of English nationalism was illustrated by England supporters starting to wave the flag of St George, rather than the Union Jack. And the presence of so many European players in British club teams has made supporters question whether they want the best team money can buy, or whether instead fewer foreigners should be allowed on board, in order to nurture more native talent. ""Football clubs are the most European institutions [in Britain],"" Mr Perryman says, ""their players, the managers, the owners, the sponsors. Do supporters like that? Yes - but only if their team is winning."" For more on this story listen to Paul Moss's report on The World Tonight."
2016-02-24,Joshua Rozenberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35630757,"Explaining why he wants the UK to leave the EU, Boris Johnson complained about ""a slow and invisible process of legal colonisation, as the EU infiltrates just about every area of public policy"".There is no doubt that the 28-member EU has come a long way since six European countries founded the European Economic Community in 1958.Their aim was to avoid another devastating war in Europe by making its countries economically interdependent.But what began as a purely economic union has become an organisation responsible for many different areas of policy, from agriculture to transport.At the heart of the EU are laws designed to allow most goods, services, money and people to move freely within EU member states. The European Commission - the EU's administrative arm - is responsible for proposing and drafting EU legislation.If draft proposals are approved by the European Parliament, representing EU citizens, and the Council of Ministers - representing member states - then the proposals become law.The two most common types of EU laws are known as regulations and directives.Regulations have direct and immediate effect within EU member states once they have been brought into effect at EU level.Directives set out an EU objective, which individual countries must transpose into national legislation.The difference can be seen in examples provided by the EU's own website.  When the EU wanted to make sure there were common safeguards on goods imported from outside the EU, it adopted a regulation. When the EU wanted to strengthen rights for consumers across the EU - for example, by eliminating hidden charges and extending the cooling-off period - it adopted a directive. EU law is interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg - or the European Court of Justice, as it used to be called.This is completely separate from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which interprets the European Convention on Human Rights.However, the EU has its own Charter of Fundamental Rights. EU institutions such as the commission, the parliament and the council are legally bound to uphold rights in the charter - as are EU governments whenever they apply EU law.The EU court in Luxembourg interprets EU law to make sure it is applied in the same way in all EU countries and settles legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions. Member states are required to comply with the court's rulings, and may be fined if they do not do so. But there are limits to the EU's powers, of which the most obvious is language.Although a common language would undoubtedly help improve trade there are no plans to impose one across Europe.Nor has the EU tried to change the constitutional structures of its member states.EU summits are attended by presidents, prime ministers and chancellors who lead countries with very different legal systems.All the EU can do is to ensure that its members meet common standards of justice and democracy.The EU's powers to make and enforce laws have a bearing on the UK's sovereignty. When we speak of the sovereignty of Parliament, we mean the right of the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with the formal approval of the monarch - to make any laws Parliament may choose.Parliament can be said to have given up some of its sovereignty when it passed the European Communities Act 1972, enabling the UK to join what was then the European Economic Community, at the beginning of 1973, and requiring courts in the UK to apply EU law.Michael Gove, who also wants to leave the EU, explained at the weekend what he saw as the consequences of EU membership.He said the UK government ""cannot remove or reduce VAT, cannot support a steel plant through troubled times, cannot build the houses we need where they're needed and cannot deport all the individuals who shouldn't be in this country"".But David Cameron took a different view of sovereignty in his interview with Andrew Marr. ""Sovereignty really means: are you able to get things done? Are you able to change things, to fix things? ""You might feel more sovereign, but if you can't get your businesses access to European markets, if you can't keep your people safe… you're less in charge of your destiny.""The prime minister also promised proposals to make clear that Parliament was sovereign. However, his proposals are not expected to include legislation.If Parliament is not already sovereign, then saying so will not change anything; and if Parliament is already sovereign, there seems little point in declaring it.Mr Cameron told Parliament the agreement reached in Brussels last week would give the UK a ""special status"" within the EU and ensure it never became part of a European super-state. However, those who want to leave the EU say the only sovereignty that matters is the ability to make all our laws in the UK.And if that's what sovereignty means, it's difficult to see how it can be achieved while the UK remains part of the EU."
2016-02-24,Safer in v safer out,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35600736,"Is Britain more - or less - at risk of a major terrorist attack if it leaves the EU?It is an important question and the public deserves a straight answer. Yet in the current heated debate it risks being both politicised and blurred by conflation with other issues like the economy, migration and policies towards Russia. So what are the facts?The UK is currently at threat level ""severe"", the second highest on the scale, meaning the government judges a terrorist attack to be ""highly likely"" (but not necessarily imminent). Britain is right up at the top of so-called Islamic State's target list, along with France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. MI5 and police estimate there to be more than 2,000 individuals living here who have sympathies with or connections to international terrorism, most of it IS-inspired. There are two principal reasons why the UK has not yet suffered the sort of Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack (MTFA) experienced twice by Parisians last year. One is better intelligence, the other is better borders. That said, no-one in counter-terrorism circles is being complacent that such an attack could not still happen here.After the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and then again after the London bombings of 2005, Britain's counter-terrorism infrastructure was reformed to break down inter-agency barriers and do away with the sort of departmental ""silos"" that, sadly, still exist in many European nations. So Britain's MI5, the domestic security service, works closely with MI6, the external intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ and the Metropolitan Police. Old rivalries have largely been set aside. Yet in France and Belgium the police and intelligence agencies hardly talk to each other, they share very little. Absurdly, for a Belgian police officer to find out what Belgian intelligence knows about a threat, he or she sometimes needs to learn it from the UK police, who learn it from UK intelligence, who learn it from Belgian intelligence. When it comes to EU-wide counter-terrorism, national intelligence agencies are even less willing to divulge their secrets.On borders, Britain has something that continental European countries do not: A single coastline. British counter-terrorism officials say that because the UK is not part of Europe's Schengen open borders agreement it is considerably more difficult - though not impossible - for terrorists and organised criminals to acquire the sort of powerful automatic weapons, notably Kalashnikovs, used in the Paris attacks last November.A senior EU counter terrorism official admitted to me last year, prior to the migrant crisis, that although the EU's external borders had been strengthened, once weapons had crossed over that border from the Balkans there was little to stop them being moved freely around Europe.The UK's strongest intelligence-sharing and security co-operation relationships are not with Europe, although those still matter. They are with the United States, with its massive eavesdropping and interception capabilities, and the other Anglophone so-called Five Eyes partner nations: Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Nearly all the most important intelligence-sharing with Europe tends to be done bilaterally, country to country, rather than through any EU-wide organisation. Britain also works closely with other partner nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia."
2016-02-24,Europeans' reaction,https://web.archive.org//web/20160224085529/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35624694,"The UK will vote on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum in June but what do people from other EU countries think about Britain's big decision?David Cameron announced the date of the in/out referendum on Saturday, after returning from Brussels with a deal he argued gave Britain a ""special status"" within the EU.Here, Europeans - who contacted us via email and on Facebook - give their reaction to the referendum being called in the UK and their views on Britain's relationship with the EU.As a Bulgarian, I'm deeply affected by the EU referendum in the UK.More than 50,000 Bulgarians have moved to the UK, searching for work and a better life. Many of them are young and skilled men and women, working hard and paying taxes like everybody else. London is right to seek improvements in the EU.It is hard to create a common EU law without a real political and economic union. That's why I'm against the idea of ever-closer union.There might be some good ideas, such as the EU army, but overall the feeling that it is not the democratically elected national parliament taking the main responsibility for a country's future, but the European Parliament in Strasbourg, is somehow nonsense.The Union is in dire straits right now. There's a variety of different problems: The refugee crisis, lack of economic growth and Russian expansion to the East.And I believe we need Britain as a strong member of the EU, when we address all these issues.My feeling is that countries who do not believe in the values of the EU should leave the union.It will be better for the remaining countries, because only then can they create a real democratic, governed and socially united Europe.I think Mr Cameron is being populist and yet he only speaks with contempt for the EU. Britain should leave the EU for once and for all and then experience what it's like to be a lone country in a global capitalistic market place. Good luck with that. I only feel sad for the people of the UK who will have to suffer from these decisions. I feel the British campaign against the EU is fuelled by hate politics more than ever. It is not a healthy position to take. Goodbye, Britain.I am a French national living in Belgium but prior to moving to Brussels I lived for more than a decade in Southampton and London. For me, Europe is about more than just free trade. It is also about sticking together and preventing another world war. It is about sharing the same democratic values and principles. I feel happy about the deal reached by David Cameron, which stayed within the limits of the EU treaties. I would love to hear more from the UK about the positive changes the EU has brought to Britain, rather than only hearing about seemingly frivolous European laws or hordes of migrants apparently crossing the Channel to exploit British resources. Now it is time for the British people to decide and their decision will have to be respected, of course. I just hope that they decide to stay in the EU. I think that the British people underestimate their culture and in fact how much we rely on them when it comes to values and pragmatism, even if people from other member states don't want to admit it. The potential ""Brexit"" is a very emotional thing to me. What I fear most is that it could unravel with many grave consequences at all levels - social, economic and diplomatic.As a Dutchman and a real European, I would like to see the UK remain a member of the EU. It's better for Europe and also better for Britain. However, I don't want to have a member who receives special treatment. This is the second time the UK has received special treatment, with the last one being under Margaret Thatcher.It should be one rule for all. The other EU members were so weak to accept Cameron's proposals.And yet Mr Cameron then says he doesn't love Brussels, he loves Great Britain. It sounds so childish and unfriendly to the rest of Europe. I think British politicians have made a number of mistakes. Lots of people will certainly agree that the EU is far from perfect and needs reform. Also, a lot of the points your PM raised make sense, like the problem of social benefits. However, British politicians like to talk in public about the EU in a way as if it was an enemy and the other 27 member states were not your friends. The natural consequence was the lack of allies they needed in and before the recent negotiations.I'm often irritated when the British write and talk about Europe as if they were not part of it. This provokes rejection. If you tell me you don't want to have anything to do with the continent, people will say ""ok, then please go away"" and you can hardly count on our support for your matters, even if they make sense.Are you a European with a view on the UK's EU referendum?

2016-02-25,"Net migration at 323,000 sparks EU row",https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35658731,"New figures showing net migration to the UK remains near record levels have sparked a row between the two sides in the EU referendum debate.The difference between the number of people leaving and arriving was 323,000 in the year to September.David Cameron said the figure was ""still too high"" but the government was taking action to bring it down.UKIP leader Nigel Farage says the only way to get immigration under control is to leave the EU in June's referendum.The government remains committed to getting net migration below 100,000 by the next election in 2020.The key points from the latest migration statistics include: Speaking at a question and answer section with BAE employees in Preston, Mr Cameron said the government was taking action ""across the board"" to bring immigration down.The prime minister said it was important to ""fix the issue of welfare"" and his EU deal to limit in-work benefits for new EU migrants would ""have an impact"".Home Secretary Theresa May, who is backing the campaign to remain in the EU, said: ""Immigration at this level puts pressure on public services, on housing, on infrastructure… it can hold down wages and push British workers out of jobs.""But she said Mr Cameron's reforms would ""reduce the pull factor of our welfare system and make it easier for us to deport people who are abusing our generosity"".Mrs May is in Brussels for crisis talks on limiting migration. Asked if the EU's response so far had been a mess, she said: ""The EU is indeed dealing with a migration crisis and that would be the same whether the UK was in the EU or outside the EU. ""As members of the EU we are able to work with others to strengthen the external borders.""But Nigel Farage, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, said: ""As I've said for years, we cannot control immigration into Britain while we remain inside the EU. The government pledge to reduce net migration to tens of thousands continues to be laughable.""I am pleased that there are now lots of voices agreeing with me, that we must leave the European Union to control our borders.""Mr Farage told BBC News net migration should be capped at about 30,000 a year, which he said would represent a return to ""normality"" and prevent immigration being the ""hot political potato that it is"". He also questioned the accuracy of the ONS figures, saying: ""If as they claim only 260,000 EU nationals arriving, then how is it possible that 650,000 National Insurance numbers have been given to foreign nationals?""Iain Duncan Smith, who is also campaigning to leave, said Mr Cameron's ""emergency brake"" on EU migrants accessing in-work benefits for up to four years would do nothing to reduce net migration and could lead to a short-term spike in new arrivals trying to beat the likely April 2017 introduction date.  The work and pensions secretary told the Guardian he had warned Mr Cameron privately that a failure to control immigration could lead to the rise of the far right. ""If you do not control your borders, my observation is that you get parties led by people like Marine Le Pen and others who feed off the back of this, and ordinary decent people feel life is out of control,"" he said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is backing the remain campaign, said: ""The solution is to make sure that communities that are affected are properly supported, and that our wage system reflects the going rate for the job, rather than systematic undermining of industry-wide agreements that have been made by some employers.""He also highlighted the ""large numbers British people"" who lived in other EU countries.Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said: ""Free movement within the EU is not the only driver of recent high levels of net migration, but it has played an important role. ""While EU migration is a defining issue in the referendum debate, the truth is that it's difficult to predict EU migration levels with confidence in either the stay or leave scenario. ""Whether Brexit would reduce migration will depend in part on the treaties and policies that followed, and these cannot be known in advance.""She said the sustained high levels of net migration raised the question ""of whether we are experiencing a temporary peak or a 'new normal' in the UK"".The Institute of Directors called the government's target for reducing net migration ""futile and nonsensical"" because nearly all of the increase could be accounted for by a reduction in the number of people leaving the UK.""Ironically, if the UK economy tanked and Britons emigrated in large numbers it would make the target more achievable,"" said spokesman Seamus Nevin.He added: ""If the British people are to make an informed decision on the future of our country, then both sides in the EU debate need to set out a sensible plan for managing inward migration.""The latest ONS figures showed asylum applications increased for the fifth year in a row, although they remain well below their 2002 peak of 103,081.The largest number of applications came from Eritrean nationals. Asylum claims by Syrian nationals were 2,846, an increase of 493, in addition to the 1,194 Syrian nationals granted humanitarian protection under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.Some 86% of Syrians were granted asylum or other forms of protection, compared with 20% for Pakistan nationals."

2016-02-25,BT told to open cable network to rivals,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35657210,"Communications watchdog Ofcom has said BT must open up its cable network and allow competition to improve UK internet connections.The regulator has so far stopped short of demanding a complete break-up of BT, but said this was still an option.BT welcomed the report and said it was happy to let other companies use its network, if they were keen to invest.Ofcom also said there was a digital divide in the UK between those with the latest technologies, and those without. It has proposed that decent, affordable broadband should be a universal right.Rivals had called for a split between BT and its Openreach operation, which runs its cables, fibre and network infrastructure. Companies such as Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk, who pay to use the network, say that BT underinvested in Openreach, leading to a poor service with interruptions and slow speeds.Now BT will be told to allow easier access for rivals to lay their own fibre cables along Openreach's telegraph poles and in its underground cable ducts.Ofcom also says it intends to introduce tougher rules on BT's faults, repairs and installations.It says Openreach should be governed at arm's length from BT, with greater independence in taking its own decisions on budget, investment and strategy.  It adds that a complete split between Openreach and BT ""remains an option"".The Chief Executive of Ofcom, Sharon White told the BBC: ""Openreach does need major reform and the key thing is that it's independent so that it responds to all its customers, not just BT. ""If we cannot get the responsiveness to customers that we're seeking, then ... we reserve the right, formally, to separate [BT and Openreach].""BT's shares rose 2.6% in the two hours following the publication of the report.A BT spokesman said: ""Openreach is already one of the most heavily regulated businesses in the world but we have volunteered to accept tighter regulation.""We are happy to let other companies use our ducts and poles if they are genuinely keen to invest very large sums as we have done.""But Ofcom's report says that the evidence ""shows Openreach still has an incentive to make decisions in the interests of BT, rather than BT's competitors"". BBC technology reporter Jane Wakefield said: ""That will be something rivals, from big players like Sky to small internet service providers that are attempting to bring broadband to areas not yet served by BT, will recognise all too well, and Ofcom's decision that the two should stay together for now will be seen as a blow.""A spokesperson for Vodafone said: ""BT still remains a monopoly provider with a regulated business running at a 28% profit margin.  ""We urge Ofcom to ensure BT reinvests the £4bn in excess profits Openreach has generated over the last decade in bringing fibre to millions of premises across the country, and not just make half-promises to spend an unsubstantiated amount on more old copper cable""BT's Openreach division is the biggest force in British broadband - and critics say it's not used that power to good effect.  The likes of TalkTalk and Sky, which rely on Openreach to connect most of their customers, charge it with poor service and failing to invest enough in the fast fibre network Britain needs. Ofcom's report shows that it shares many of their concerns - but it's stopped short of the radical action they wanted. BT will not be forced to sell Openreach in the short term - though that threat remains in the regulator's back pocket if it doesn't see the changes it wants. Much of the criticism of BT has centred on its continued reliance on old copper cables to carry fast broadband connections into homes from its fibre network - rather than laying fibre right into homes. Ofcom's Sharon White told me ""fibre is the future"" - and compared the UK unfavourably with countries like Japan in hooking up homes and businesses to ultrafast connections.BT must be in two minds about the report - relieved that what it sees as the massive disruption of a break-up isn't imminent, but concerned that the regulator will be on its back for years demanding more co-operation and greater investment.Customers will simply want to know when they will get faster connections and a better service. Ofcom itself will be in the firing line if that doesn't happen soon.What future for BT and broadband?Telecoms consultancy CCS insight said: ""The news will be a relief for BT, but rivals will also claim victory as Openreach remains under severe scrutiny. ""The tone of the statement reflects concern about BT's role in the UK's broadband future. Opening the network offers opportunities for competitors; new minimum standards will ensure customer service stays in the spotlight.""The report also says the surge in data speeds has led to a ""digital divide"" between those who have the fastest internet access and those who are left behind. It says: ""As the world goes increasingly online, those left behind risk social and economic exclusion. We have found that people who are left behind are usually less well-off or living in vulnerable circumstances.""""2.4 million households and small businesses (around 8% of all UK premises) cannot yet access a decent broadband speed of 10Mbits per second,"" the report said.The report, Making Communications Work for Everyone, says: ""We will work with the UK Government to make decent, affordable broadband a universal right for every home and small business in the UK. ""The universal right should start off at 10Mbits per second for everyone, and then rise in line with customer demand over time."""

2016-02-25,Rough sleeping up by 30% in a year,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35661767,"The number of people sleeping rough in England increased by 30% in a year, new figures show.A total of 3,569 rough sleepers were identified by counts and estimates by local authorities in Autumn 2015, up from 2,744 a year before.Labour said the figures were ""the starkest possible reminder"" of Conservative housing policy failure.Ministers said government funding for homelessless over the next four years had been increased to £139m.The latest figures have been released by the Department for Communities and Local Government, which described them as ""single night snapshots"".London accounted for 26% of the total, a similar proportion to the previous year. The local authority recording the highest totals was Westminster, followed by Bristol, Brighton and Hove, Manchester and Cornwall.Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""People will find it extraordinary that in England in the 21st century the number of people forced to sleep rough is going up - and this is only the tip of the iceberg.""He urged ministers to exempt accommodation for homeless people from housing benefit cuts.Homelessness Minister Marcus Jones said nobody should ever have to sleep rough.""We have protected homelessness prevention funding and expect local authorities to provide quality advice and assistance to all those that approach them for help,"" he said.Mr Jones said a £5m ""social impact bond"" would help people with mental health problems or addiction to move off the streets.Separate figures relating to London, compiled by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network, found that 14% of the rough sleepers identified in the capital in 2014-15 were female.Where nationalities were available, 43% were from the UK, and 36% from Central and Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007."
2016-02-25,EU in crisis talks over migrant limits,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35657054,"Ministers from EU and Balkan nations are meeting in Brussels to try to heal rifts over migrants that have plunged common policy into chaos.Austria, Serbia and Macedonia have taken their own steps to limit entry to migrants, angering Greece, which fears the controls will cause a bottleneck.A surge in migration, and the failure to agree an EU-wide response, have led to warnings about the bloc's survival.More than 100,000 migrants have entered the EU illegally this year.European Council president Donald Tusk has warned that the failure to make progress towards resolving the crisis could increase the likelihood of the UK voting to leave the EU this year.The EU interior ministers meeting in Brussels will hear plans drawn up by Austria and eight Balkan countries that seek to restrict the numbers entering their borders. An official from the current Dutch presidency of the EU told the AFP news agency that the purpose of Thursday's meetings would be ""to allow us to avoid surprises - we have to avoid that one country is surprised by the measures taken by another"". Relocation deal explainedHungary proposes its own dealWhy central Europe says 'No'EU migration: Crisis in graphicsIn separate developmentsThe new measures - from Austria and its Balkan partners - include fingerprinting all entrants and turning back anyone without a passport or holding fake documents.The countries have also pledged to accept only those they deem to be in need of protection, which has already been interpreted by some governments as meaning only Syrians and Iraqis.Macedonia enacted the measures at its border with Greece over the weekend, barring entry to Afghans, who make up many of the migrants.Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner described the measures as a ""chain reaction of reason"" and warned that the crisis could threaten the EU's survival if it was not brought under control.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian foreign minister, told German TV that Europe had to ""abandon this goal of allowing in unlimited numbers"". ""We in Austria are overwhelmed,"" he said. ""It cannot be that all migrants make their applications for asylum in Western Europe.""But the plans drew sharp criticism from Greece, which is the first stop on European soil for thousands of migrants arriving by sea every day. On Thursday so far, some 2,000 migrants have been ferried from eastern islands to the port of Piraeus, Athens.Greece has threatened to block all decisions at EU migration summits next month if member states do not agree to take in quotas of migrants.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said his country was turning into a ""permanent warehouse of souls"" and should not be left to deal with the crisis alone.""From now on, Greece will not agree to deals if we do not secure the mandatory sharing of the burden and responsibility proportionally among member states,"" Mr Tsipras said.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told a German newspaper that it was an ""illusion"" to think Greece could be excluded from any agreements on migration.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has also criticised the latest measures. ""The response is not closures, it is co-operation,"" said the agency's head, Filippo Grandi. ""Everybody has to take a share of this burden.""Germany's parliament has meanwhile backed new measures to speed up the processing of claims from migrants who are less likely to be granted asylum.The move envisages the creation of new reception centres where certain categories of asylum-seekers - those from so-called countries ""safe countries of origin"" or those who have not helped the authorities with their claims - can have their claims processed within three weeks.The measures also include a controversial provision to delay family reunions for migrants who are not believed to ""personally persecuted"".Last September, EU ministers agreed plans to relocate 120,000 migrants from Italy, Greece and Hungary to other EU countries. But the majority vote decision was opposed by Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.What the European papers say - BBC MonitoringSeveral papers from countries in the thick of the EU migrant crisis are worried about their leaders' approach.Influential journalist Alan Posener, in Germany's Die Welt, believes Chancellor Angela Merkel's ""short-sighted actions"" on the crisis are helping Russia sow division among European states. ""The EU is blowing up around Merkel - to Putin's delight,"" he writes. Austria's Kronen Zeitung also reports that Mrs Merkel is under pressure to consider Austrian and Balkan proposals to restrict the flow of refugees. ""Will Berlin join the 'Viennese way'?"" a headline asks. But another Austrian paper, the Kurier, worries that the proposals have put Vienna ""on a collision course with the EU"". Meanwhile, Greek daily I Kathemerini laments that ""the nightmare scenario of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants trapped has come to pass"", adding that the government is ill-prepared for this situation, and cannot negotiate its way out.""Regardless of Greek shortcomings,"" the paper says, ""Europeans have a responsibility not to feed the snake of anti-European sentiment in Greece.""On Wednesday Hungary announced it would hold a referendum on accepting mandatory EU migrant quotas. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stressed that the quotas ""could redraw Europe's cultural and religious identity"".In an interview with German newspaper Bild, he said Europe was paying Turkey to secure its borders as it could not protect them itself.""This policy makes Europe's future and security reliant on the goodwill of Turkey,"" he warned. The referendum is expected to be held in the autumn, subject to parliamentary approval.More than 100,000 migrants have arrived in Greece and Italy so far this year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.More than 400 migrants died attempting to make the journey during the same period, the IOM said.A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
2016-02-25,London pupils 'behind global rivals',https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-35650496,"London's schools are falling behind many global competitors, according to an analysis of international tests.The capital's schools have been held up as a showcase of rising standards.But the University College London (UCL) Institute of Education study, using OECD Pisa test results, suggests they are weaker than those in many Asian cities and the rest of the UK.However, the OECD's education director, Andreas Schleicher, has rejected the findings as ""not credible"".Mr Schleicher says the London schools taking the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests were not intended to be representative of the greater London area and such comparisons were invalid.The Department for Education also cautioned about sample size and that the results were from several years ago.But academics at the UCL Institute of Education say they have produced a robust sample of 42 schools by combining the results of two year groups taking the tests in London in 2009 and 2012.The analysis compares these London results, in reading, maths and science, with the performance of 15-year-olds in cities, regions and countries around the world.It suggests if London entered the Pisa tests as a separate education system, pupils taking maths would be three years behind their counterparts in Shanghai, which has the world's top-ranking results.And as well as being behind high-flyers in maths such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Finland and Poland, teenagers in London were below the level of counterparts in countries such as Spain, Italy, France, Slovenia and Latvia.For reading, the analysis put London behind Madrid in Spain, Riga in Latvia and Massachusetts, the highest-achieving state in the United States.In science tests, London would be above the US state of Florida and Buenos Aires in Argentina, but behind Moscow in Russia and Quebec in Canada.And in all three subjects, London was far behind the school systems of Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.The report also suggests London schools were below the UK national average, with girls and disadvantaged and ethnic minority pupils in London performing less well at Pisa tests compared with their GCSE results.However, these Pisa tests were taken against a backdrop of London schools improving, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says the London schools taking them were, in any case, not a reliable sample for such regional comparisons.Report author John Jerrim said the study was a ""single piece in a much bigger jigsaw"" and the success at GCSE in London schools was still a ""cause for celebration"".But she added: ""The global perspective is what we should focus on. ""We shouldn't just look to London as a benchmark, we should look at the wider world.""Munira Mirza, London's Deputy Mayor for Education and Culture, said it showed there should be no ""complacency"" in supporting London schools to improve.""Whilst young Londoners get the best results in the country at GCSE, this research highlights the challenges still faced by London's disadvantaged students in achieving as well as their peers.""A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""London has been a real success story, particularly in improving outcomes for disadvantaged pupils, as the report authors acknowledge, and our reformed world-class qualifications are ensuring all pupils have the chance to fulfil their potential.""This report is based on a small sample of schools, and uses data from 2012 and doesn't take into account the impact of many of our reforms, so should be treated with caution."""
2016-02-25,UK 'safer in EU' - ex-defence chiefs,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35647071,"The UK is safer in the EU and better able to meet a range of global threats, including so-called Islamic State and Russia, ex-defence chiefs have said.Twelve of the country's senior military figures said the UK was stronger in the EU at a time of ""grave"" challenges.Downing Street later expressed regret that it had included a 13th signatory - Gen Sir Michael Rose - on the letter to the Daily Telegraph by mistake. At least two defence ministers are backing the leave campaign.A referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU will be held on 23 June.The intervention comes after leaders of some of Britain's biggest companies said leaving the EU would put the UK's economy at risk. The letter, released by Downing Street and signed by officers from all three services, including former Chiefs of Defence Staff Lord Bramall and Lord Stirrup, said that while Nato was the most important alliance for UK security, the EU was an ""increasingly important pillar of our security"". It said Europe was facing ""grave security challenges"" from instability in the Middle East, the rise of so-called Islamic State and ""resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression"".The letter also said: ""Britain will have to confront these challenges whether it is inside or outside the EU. But within the EU, we are stronger. ""Inside it, we can continue to collaborate closely with our European allies, just as we did when we helped to force the Iranians to the negotiating table through EU-wide sanctions, or made sure that [Russian President] Putin would pay a price for his aggression in Ukraine."" The letter said the UK's ""firm veto over EU foreign policy decisions"" meant it would not be forced to join EU initiatives that were ""against our strategic interest"" and would also allow it to block the rest of the EU from going ahead in such circumstances.""Britain's role in the EU strengthens the security we enjoy as part of Nato, adds to our capability and flexibility when it comes to defence co-operation and allows us to project greater power on the international stage,"" the former defence chiefs added. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the letter made ""very similar arguments"" to those already put forward by Prime Minister David Cameron as to why Britain should remain in the European Union. He said the claim the UK would be safer in the EU would be ""hotly disputed"" and one not everyone in the military would necessarily agree with - defence ministers Penny Mordaunt and Julian Brazier back the leave campaign. Later on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman admitted that Number 10 had mistakenly included as a signatory the former director of special forces, Gen Rose.The spokesman said the general had got in touch from New Zealand to inform Number 10 of the error.Signatories of the letter:"
2016-02-25,Thousands 'wiped off vote register',https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35650851,"Tens of thousands of people could miss out on a vote in the EU referendum and May's Scottish, Welsh and English local elections after changes to the registration process.At least 770,000 names have been removed from the electoral register, the Electoral Commission says.The watchdog said young people had been hit the hardest.The government says the new system will cut down on electoral fraud and ""ghost"" entries on the register.Voters now have to register as individuals rather than by household.Millions of people were transferred automatically on to the new register after having their identity confirmed by checking social security and council tax records.Names that could not be verified in this way were kept on the register until 1 December but have now been removed.People in England, Scotland and Wales can register to vote online - if they live in Northern Ireland they can print out a form and send it to their local registration office.Since December, 1.3 million people have signed up to vote individually, following an advertising campaign encouraging people to get on the electoral roll in time for May's elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and council ballots across England. But the Electoral Commission and the Labour Party said the transition had been rushed and people in short-term rental agreements, often in urban areas, and those moving on a regular basis, such as students, had been disproportionately affected.Under the old system, universities registered students en masse.The Electoral Commission said last June that 1.9 million names had disappeared from the register across England, Scotland and Wales as a result of the changes - although it was not clear how many of these were actually entitled to vote. The government ignored the watchdog's advice to keep names on the register for longer to allow councils more time to check them.In its latest assessment, the commission has ""significantly"" reduced its estimate of the missing names to 770,000 - although the figure is still equivalent to 1.7% of the total 43.4 million electorate. But it also pointed out the figure was not comprehensive as the London borough of Hackney could not provide accurate information.  ""It is not possible to estimate the number of eligible electors who were removed from the registers,"" it said in a statement. ""However, the commission reports that it is likely that some of the removed entries related to electors that were eligible to remain registered to vote.""It said the number of under-18s - so-called ""attainers"", qualifying to vote during the registration period - had fallen by 40% since March 2014.In its report, the watchdog has made a number of recommendations to government to try to halt the decline in registration.Labour said the decline in the number of young people registering to vote was ""shocking"", adding: ""What's worse is that the government are shamelessly taking this as an opportunity to redraw constituency boundaries based on an electorate that is far lower than it should be.""The independent Boundary Commission for England said on Wednesday it had begun redrawing the map of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England.The move follows a decision by Parliament to reduce the number of constituencies in the UK from 650 to 600, and to ensure that there are roughly the same number of electors in each constituency. Sam Hartley, secretary to the Boundary Commission for England, said: ""Once we publish our initial proposals in the autumn, we will need the help of residents in all regions to ensure that our proposals take account of local ties and best reflect the geography on the ground. Everyone's views will help us recommend a well-considered and practical set of constituency boundaries in England.""John Penrose, Minister for Constitutional Reform, said: ""Councils have only removed 'ghost' electors - people who have moved, died or never existed in the first place - so keeping them on the register when we know they shouldn't be there, and then sending them all poll cards on election day, would be wrong, expensive and increase the risk of fraud.""Equalising the size of constituencies in the Boundary Review means everyone's vote will carry equal weight. ""If we let some constituencies stay smaller than others, voters will have more power in them than people in bigger ones. And the boundaries would be based on data that's 20 years out of date. That can't be fair or right.""Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest 600,000 people have fallen off the register in the past year.The ONS said the total size of the UK electorate was 44,722,004."
2016-02-25,Tusk: EU reforms cannot be reversed,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35653155,"The package of reforms negotiated by David Cameron cannot be reversed by European judges, according to the EU Council president.Donald Tusk told MEPs the deal was ""legally binding and irreversible"".It comes after Justice Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC the European Court of Justice could throw out some measures without EU treaty change.Both Downing Street and attorney general Jeremy Wright say the reforms cannot be reversed.A UK referendum on whether to remain a member of the EU will take place on 23 June, with the Conservative Party and David Cameron's cabinet divided over which side to support.Mr Gove, one of five cabinet ministers campaigning for an EU exit, said that without treaty change all elements of the PM's renegotiation settlement were potentially subject to legal challenge. ""The facts are that the European Court of Justice is not bound by this agreement until treaties are changed and we don't know when that will be,"" he said. He said Mr Cameron was ""absolutely right that this is a deal between 28 nations all of whom believe it"", adding: ""But the whole point about the European Court of Justice is that it stands above the nation states.""But the PM's spokesman said the text of the deal would be deposited at the United Nations later on Wednesday, adding that this would ""put beyond doubt that it is legally binding and irreversible in EU law"".Mr Tusk, who played a key role in negotiating the settlement, said it was ""in conformity with the treaties and cannot be annulled by the European Court of Justice"".He said: ""But it will only enter into force if the British people vote to stay. If they vote to leave, the settlement will cease to exist.""The UK's negotiation ""was the first round… and the last"", he added.If it walks, talks and smells like a treaty, then it is a treaty. What is important is the substance of the agreement and not the label ""treaty"". As Mr Gove acknowledges, this is a ""deal between 28 nations all of whom believe it"".  In other words, all of whom intend to be bound by it.The more significant question is, perhaps, what is the value and status of the deal as a matter of EU law?Read the rest of Clive's analysisMr Tusk was speaking at the first European Parliament session since the European Council summit where the reforms were agreed following drawn-out negotiations between leaders.BBC political correspondent Ben Wright in Brussels said there was some ""exasperation"" on show from some political groupings that they ""had been forced to go through this in the first place"".Earlier Downing Street responded to Mr Gove's comments on legality by citing Alan Dashwood, the former director of legal services at the EU, who said the ""Decision"" was a binding legal agreement reached by consensus and could only be amended or rescinded by consensus - or, ""in other words, with the agreement of the UK"".The European Court of Justice was set up in the 1950s to ensure European law is interpreted and applied evenly in every EU country but many Tory MPs believe it has over-extended its jurisdiction and its powers should be rolled back.Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said the guarantee that the UK would be exempted from ever-closer union would be ""written exactly"" into the treaties in the form it was agreed last week and ""nobody can tell British voters other things"".Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergMr Gove's comments will be catnip for Eurosceptics who've already been arguing that Mr Cameron's deal is hardly worth the paper its written on.For David Cameron, maintaining the sense that the deal he's achieved can and will improve the UK's relationship with the rest of the European Union in a meaningful way is a vital part of his campaign.It's one thing Tories from different parts, different generations of the party, disagreeing. It's quite another when it is two who have shared political hopes, ambition, and even family holidays.Read more from LauraJoshua Rozenberg: Does the EU impact on UK sovereignty?Mr Wright, the government's senior law officer, told the BBC that although challenges could be brought to the European Court of Justice, the UK agreement had ""very similar legal strength"" to existing treaty obligations.""The suggestion that this agreement does not have legal effect until it is incorporated into EU treaties is not correct. That is not just my opinion - it is the opinion of this government's lawyers, lawyers for the EU, and, I suspect, the majority of lawyers in this country.""Former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC that Mr Gove was simply ""wrong"".But the justice secretary's comments were seized upon by Conservative MPs campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.Human rights minister Dominic Raab said: ""The last word on enforceability very clearly lies with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.""Speaking during the European Parliament session, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said lodging the document with the UN was ""completely meaningless"". ""You might as well lodge a pair of socks,"" he added.Ministers who want to quit the EU have been allowed special dispensation to oppose the government at the referendum, although strict rules have been put in place for the campaign.The BBC has been told that following Mr Gove's interview, Downing Street ordered his officials to stop showing him documents concerning the EU.Number 10 said Mr Gove was subject to the same rules as every minister arguing for the UK to leave the EU and the move was nothing to do with his comments.In other referendum developments, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said she thought the impact of the UK leaving the EU was ""bound to be a negative on all fronts"".She added that it would be a bad development ""For those who stay, because there are fewer of them, and for those who go, because they lose the benefit of that facilitation of exchange."""
2016-02-25,PM to Corbyn: 'Put on a proper suit',https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35651000,"David Cameron has told Jeremy Corbyn to smarten up his appearance during Prime Minister's Questions.The prime minister said his mother would advise the Labour leader to ""put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem"".He was hitting back at a jibe from a Labour MP about his mother. The Labour leader took a few moments to respond as Tory MPs barracked him, before offering some ""motherly advice"" about standing up for a free NHS.""My late mother would have said, 'stand up for the principle of a health service free at the point of use for everybody', because that's what she dedicated her life to, as did many of her generation,"" he said.A tweet then went out from Mr Corbyn's official account that quoted Albert Einstein.""'If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes & shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas & shoddy philosophies' Einstein #pmqs,"" the message said.The PM later appeared at a Conservative EU rally without a tie or jacket, joking that he had ""ignored my mother's own advice"".Education Secretary Nicky Morgan defended his decision to criticise Mr Corbyn's dress sense, which followed a heckle from a Labour MP.""What was really noticeable on Monday during the EU statement was that Jeremy Corbyn's top button was not done up, his tie wasn't straight,""  she told BBC Radio 4's World At One.""Actually I think there are standards in Parliament. If you bring families or mothers into it you can expect to have a pretty firm bite-back from any politician.""A senior Labour source said: ""I think when you are losing an argument, you resort to personal insult. When you are not able to answer questions on the NHS, you resort to silly insults. It's got no place in politics.""The source said Mr Corbyn had ""several suits"", adding: ""I don't think he will be taking sartorial advice from David Cameron or his mother.""Mr Cameron's mother Mary hit the headlines earlier this month after signing a petition against cuts to children's centres in his constituency.The two leaders were arguing about the junior doctors dispute when they began trading jibes about what their mothers would say.Mr Corbyn asked if the PM would be ""writing another letter to himself, asking on behalf of his constituents asking for the health secretary to intervene and support his local NHS?""The prime minister was heckled by Labour MPs as he made his reply, with one shouting ""ask your mother"".""Ask my mother?"" said the prime minister. ""I think I know what my mother would say. I think she would look across the despatch box and she would say 'Put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem'.""Mr Cameron's attack delighted Tory backbenchers who cheered uproariously for more than 30 seconds.But Labour MPs on twitter accused him of making a personal attack and of bringing Prime Minister's Questions to a ""new low"".Lib Dem leader Tim Farron tweeted: ""When #PMQs descends into a series of 'Your mum' comments it shows all politicians up. It's school-ground antics that demeans."""
2016-02-25,MSPs agree 2016-17 Scottish budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35649196,"The Scottish government's budget for the next year is expected to be passed by MSPs later. Opposition parties will use the debate to continue to press Finance Secretary John Swinney for a 1p rise in Scottish income tax rates to generate funding for education. Meanwhile, trade union members will protest outside Holyrood over cuts to council budgets. Mr Swinney has already ruled out raising income tax in his budget. BBC Scotland understands the finance secretary will announce new funding to help close the attainment gap in the country's schools as part of the final budget debate.Among other key measures are a new 3% levy of the purchase price of second homes and buy-to-let properties. Mr Swinney has also pledged to continue the council tax freeze, and to invest £200m over the next five years in six new NHS treatment centres.Other measures proposed by Mr Swinney are:Reaction to the budget has largely focused on its impact on local government finances, with council body Cosla previously claiming that Scotland's 32 councils would lose out on £350m between them.But despite threats from some councils that they were considering raising council tax rates in an attempt to ease the burden on their finances, none have actually done so. Speaking ahead of the Holyrood budget debate, which is due to start at 14:40, Mark Ferguson of the Unison union said: ""We are already seeing cuts to services for disabled people, older people, education, youth services, school support, libraries, road repairs and much more.""It's why we are calling on the Scottish Parliament to look at this budget again.""Both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have called for the Scottish rate of income tax to be set one penny higher than the rate set elsewhere in the UK by Chancellor George Osborne. They have argued the move could raise about £475m. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the move would mean ""we can end cuts, not enforce them"". She added: ""Nicola Sturgeon has spent her career telling Scotland that more powers means fewer cuts. The SNP are now the only barrier to stopping these cuts.""Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: ""Half of what councils do is education. Some have already passed their own budgets that include damaging reductions they are having to make as the SNP tighten the purse strings.""This is one of our last opportunities to stop these cuts. John Swinney must reconsider his proposals and support a £475m investment in our nurseries, schools and colleges to allow everyone to achieve their potential.""But the Scottish Conservatives have said that taxes in Scotland should be no higher than the rest of the UK - and lower when affordable.The Scottish Greens have put forward proposals for raising revenue though measures including a tax on derelict and vacant land and allowing councils to set their own levels of council tax without financial penalty.Mr Swinney has argued that increasing income tax rates at this stage would hit the country's lowest-paid workers hardest as any changes would need to be made across all of the tax bands. But the Scottish government has said it will look at creating a more ""progressive"" tax regime when greater powers over income tax are devolved under the Scotland Bill, which is expected to come into force next year. Speaking at the weekend, Mr  Swinney said: ""Thousands of Scotland's lowest-earning public-sector workers will be better-off thanks to the uprating of the living wage and an uplift of £400 for those covered by public sector pay policy and earning £22,000 or less.""We won't add to the tax burden of those workers who help to form the backbone of our communities - the newly-qualified nurses, newly-qualified teachers, police officers, firefighters, postmen, bus drivers, charity workers, shop workers, and hotel workers - and are among the lowest paid."""

2016-02-25,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary.

She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

2016-02-25,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-25,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday 23 June. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" The options for voters will be 'Remain a member of the European Union' and 'Leave the European Union'. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Brendan, from London, wonders whether he would need to have obtained indefinite leave to remain before being entitled to a vote. We have checked with the Electoral Commission, who say all Commonwealth citizens in the UK are entitled to a vote, regardless of their immigration status, provided they are old enough and on the electoral register."

2016-02-25,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."

2016-02-25,What has happened to EU and non-EU migration?,https://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/web/20160225150627/http://bbc.in/1WKVZea,
2016-02-25,Just a game...,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35631257,"It was one of the great political upsets of British post-War history. In 1970, Britain's Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was widely expected to hold on to power in a general election he himself had called. But when the voting verdict came in, Mr Wilson found himself being bundled out of Downing Street, and the Conservative leader, Edward Heath, taking his place.  And some sought solace in a simple explanation: football.England had lost a World Cup quarter-final tie just four days before the vote, and this was no ordinary match.Defeat had come at the hands of West Germany, the team England had beaten just four years previously to win the World Cup. And right up until the end of the game, another England victory had seemed on the cards, with the side 2-0 up at half-time. But then three German goals came in, one after the other.""The sense of letdown could not have been greater,"" says Kier Radnedge, who watched the game as a young football reporter. He believes it may well have affected the way some people then voted.""It deflated the mood in the nation,"" he says, ""therefore, they looked for something new. Something new in that case was voting in a new government.""Forty-six years later, the people of Britain will once again be voting in the wake of an international football tie, and that vote could prove more crucial than any individual election. A referendum will decide whether or not the UK should remain a member of the European Union. But just days beforehand, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will play the last of their group matches in the Euro 2016 championships.""If England, Wales or Northern Ireland have won their group, then it will make people feel good about being part of Europe,"" says Mark Perryman, founder of the company Football Philosophy. ""If they come home early, people will ask, 'Do we really want to part of this continent?'""Campaigning in the referendum will not revolve around footballing matters, of course. Debate on EU membership has tended to focus on economic issues, particularly whether a Britain out of the EU would be able to trade as easily with EU member states. Also crucial is immigration, opponents of the EU saying membership allows too many foreigners to live and work in Britain.  Supporters, by contrast, say foreign workers have been a benefit to the UK, not a cost.But Mr Radnedge says too much credence is given to rationality in political argument.""People are swayed by their moods,"" he says about voting. ""It really is a lot to do with how people are feeling on the day."" Mr Radnedge admits the effects of a football match would be marginal, but then marginal votes count in what may be a close-run contest. ""It is illogical, but then people are illogical,"" he says.Whoever wins or loses, the European Championships will certainly compete with the referendum campaign for space on newspaper front pages, and on radio and television news bulletins. And that is not good for the government in this case, according to a former government spin doctor.Charlie Whelan, who served as the press man for Gordon Brown when he was Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, says they always avoided any political event clashing with a major football tie.""You want to control the news agenda as much as you can,"" Mr Whelan says.  ""If you have no idea what's going to happen on any given day, the agenda is set by 22 guys kicking round a football."" But the clash of ballot and ball this June will not represent a completely new mixing of two otherwise-separate fields, because football has always provided an outlet for nationalist passions, and therefore raised questions of nationhood and national identity. The rise of English nationalism was illustrated by England supporters starting to wave the flag of St George, rather than the Union Jack. And the presence of so many European players in British club teams has made supporters question whether they want the best team money can buy, or whether instead fewer foreigners should be allowed on board, in order to nurture more native talent. ""Football clubs are the most European institutions [in Britain],"" Mr Perryman says, ""their players, the managers, the owners, the sponsors. Do supporters like that? Yes - but only if their team is winning."" For more on this story listen to Paul Moss's report on The World Tonight."
2016-02-25,Joshua Rozenberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35630757,"Explaining why he wants the UK to leave the EU, Boris Johnson complained about ""a slow and invisible process of legal colonisation, as the EU infiltrates just about every area of public policy"".There is no doubt that the 28-member EU has come a long way since six European countries founded the European Economic Community in 1958.Their aim was to avoid another devastating war in Europe by making its countries economically interdependent.But what began as a purely economic union has become an organisation responsible for many different areas of policy, from agriculture to transport.At the heart of the EU are laws designed to allow most goods, services, money and people to move freely within EU member states. The European Commission - the EU's administrative arm - is responsible for proposing and drafting EU legislation.If draft proposals are approved by the European Parliament, representing EU citizens, and the Council of Ministers - representing member states - then the proposals become law.The two most common types of EU laws are known as regulations and directives.Regulations have direct and immediate effect within EU member states once they have been brought into effect at EU level.Directives set out an EU objective, which individual countries must transpose into national legislation.The difference can be seen in examples provided by the EU's own website.  When the EU wanted to make sure there were common safeguards on goods imported from outside the EU, it adopted a regulation. When the EU wanted to strengthen rights for consumers across the EU - for example, by eliminating hidden charges and extending the cooling-off period - it adopted a directive. EU law is interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg - or the European Court of Justice, as it used to be called.This is completely separate from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which interprets the European Convention on Human Rights.However, the EU has its own Charter of Fundamental Rights. EU institutions such as the commission, the parliament and the council are legally bound to uphold rights in the charter - as are EU governments whenever they apply EU law.The EU court in Luxembourg interprets EU law to make sure it is applied in the same way in all EU countries and settles legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions. Member states are required to comply with the court's rulings, and may be fined if they do not do so. But there are limits to the EU's powers, of which the most obvious is language.Although a common language would undoubtedly help improve trade there are no plans to impose one across Europe.Nor has the EU tried to change the constitutional structures of its member states.EU summits are attended by presidents, prime ministers and chancellors who lead countries with very different legal systems.All the EU can do is to ensure that its members meet common standards of justice and democracy.The EU's powers to make and enforce laws have a bearing on the UK's sovereignty. When we speak of the sovereignty of Parliament, we mean the right of the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with the formal approval of the monarch - to make any laws Parliament may choose.Parliament can be said to have given up some of its sovereignty when it passed the European Communities Act 1972, enabling the UK to join what was then the European Economic Community, at the beginning of 1973, and requiring courts in the UK to apply EU law.Michael Gove, who also wants to leave the EU, explained at the weekend what he saw as the consequences of EU membership.He said the UK government ""cannot remove or reduce VAT, cannot support a steel plant through troubled times, cannot build the houses we need where they're needed and cannot deport all the individuals who shouldn't be in this country"".But David Cameron took a different view of sovereignty in his interview with Andrew Marr. ""Sovereignty really means: are you able to get things done? Are you able to change things, to fix things? ""You might feel more sovereign, but if you can't get your businesses access to European markets, if you can't keep your people safe… you're less in charge of your destiny.""The prime minister also promised proposals to make clear that Parliament was sovereign. However, his proposals are not expected to include legislation.If Parliament is not already sovereign, then saying so will not change anything; and if Parliament is already sovereign, there seems little point in declaring it.Mr Cameron told Parliament the agreement reached in Brussels last week would give the UK a ""special status"" within the EU and ensure it never became part of a European super-state. However, those who want to leave the EU say the only sovereignty that matters is the ability to make all our laws in the UK.And if that's what sovereignty means, it's difficult to see how it can be achieved while the UK remains part of the EU."
2016-02-25,Safer in v safer out,https://web.archive.org//web/20160225150627/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35600736,"Is Britain more - or less - at risk of a major terrorist attack if it leaves the EU?It is an important question and the public deserves a straight answer. Yet in the current heated debate it risks being both politicised and blurred by conflation with other issues like the economy, migration and policies towards Russia. So what are the facts?The UK is currently at threat level ""severe"", the second highest on the scale, meaning the government judges a terrorist attack to be ""highly likely"" (but not necessarily imminent). Britain is right up at the top of so-called Islamic State's target list, along with France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. MI5 and police estimate there to be more than 2,000 individuals living here who have sympathies with or connections to international terrorism, most of it IS-inspired. There are two principal reasons why the UK has not yet suffered the sort of Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack (MTFA) experienced twice by Parisians last year. One is better intelligence, the other is better borders. That said, no-one in counter-terrorism circles is being complacent that such an attack could not still happen here.After the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and then again after the London bombings of 2005, Britain's counter-terrorism infrastructure was reformed to break down inter-agency barriers and do away with the sort of departmental ""silos"" that, sadly, still exist in many European nations. So Britain's MI5, the domestic security service, works closely with MI6, the external intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ and the Metropolitan Police. Old rivalries have largely been set aside. Yet in France and Belgium the police and intelligence agencies hardly talk to each other, they share very little. Absurdly, for a Belgian police officer to find out what Belgian intelligence knows about a threat, he or she sometimes needs to learn it from the UK police, who learn it from UK intelligence, who learn it from Belgian intelligence. When it comes to EU-wide counter-terrorism, national intelligence agencies are even less willing to divulge their secrets.On borders, Britain has something that continental European countries do not: A single coastline. British counter-terrorism officials say that because the UK is not part of Europe's Schengen open borders agreement it is considerably more difficult - though not impossible - for terrorists and organised criminals to acquire the sort of powerful automatic weapons, notably Kalashnikovs, used in the Paris attacks last November.A senior EU counter terrorism official admitted to me last year, prior to the migrant crisis, that although the EU's external borders had been strengthened, once weapons had crossed over that border from the Balkans there was little to stop them being moved freely around Europe.The UK's strongest intelligence-sharing and security co-operation relationships are not with Europe, although those still matter. They are with the United States, with its massive eavesdropping and interception capabilities, and the other Anglophone so-called Five Eyes partner nations: Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Nearly all the most important intelligence-sharing with Europe tends to be done bilaterally, country to country, rather than through any EU-wide organisation. Britain also works closely with other partner nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia."

2016-02-26,Boris Johnson on EU vote: 'Out is out',https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35675348,"London Mayor Boris Johnson has clarified his position on the idea that a vote to leave the EU could force Brussels to give Britain a better deal and trigger a second referendum.Mr Johnson had previously suggested that only by voting to leave would the UK ""get the change we need"". But in The Times, Mr Johnson stated categorically: ""Out is out"".Meanwhile finance ministers from G20 countries have raised concerns with the chancellor about a possible Brexit. The UK will vote on whether to Leave or Remain in the EU on 23 June. How plausible is second EU referendum?Mr Johnson wrote in his Daily Telegraph column on Monday that ""EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says 'no' "". This claim was widely interpreted as suggesting he would then advocate a second referendum.But on Saturday, Mr Johnson said in the Times: ""What I want is to get out and then negotiate a series of trade arrangements around the world."" Asked whether he had given up on the idea of a second referendum, Mr Johnson added: ""I don't think it would be necessary.""He told the paper the vote was a golden opportunity ""to take back control, to renew our approach to law making, to strike new trade deals around the world, to galvanise our economy and politics and to give people confidence back in their country"".""The advantage of a 'no' vote is that it would jolt the whole system in Europe,"" he said. ""For their own sake, they need to look at the way they are doing things.""Chinese and American officials and the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, discussed the referendum with Chancellor George Osborne on Friday in Shanghai during the G20 summit, where finance ministers from the world's biggest economies discuss key issues in the global economy.   The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the ministers were expected to raise an official warning of the risks of an Out vote when the final communique of their meeting was published later.  Lord Howard, who led the Tories between 2003 and 2005, said on Friday that EU leaders would have to think again about far-reaching reform in the immediate aftermath of an Out vote.The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the suggestion an Out vote could lead to a second referendum had the political advantage of reassuring voters who were temped to leave the EU but were nervous about the potential consequences. But Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed the idea as a ""complete fiction"".He added: ""It is a very simple question on the ballot paper - you either stay in the EU or you leave.""Chancellor George Osborne has said if Britain voted to leave the EU it would cause a profound economic shock.He said it was the ""very worst time"" for Britain to take such an ""enormous economic gamble""."
2016-02-26,Osborne warns of further spending cuts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35672158,"Chancellor George Osborne has warned he may have to make fresh cuts to public spending in next month's Budget.Mr Osborne told the BBC global economic turmoil and slower growth meant ""we may need to undertake further reductions"".He slowed the pace of cuts in the last spending review, but suggested savings could be announced in his 16 March Budget statement as figures showed the UK economy was smaller than expected.Labour's John McDonnell said it was ""a total humiliation"" for Mr Osborne.Speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg during a visit to China, Mr Osborne said he would rather look for extra cuts now than risk breaking his own manifesto commitment to achieve a surplus in the budget by the end of this Parliament, in 2020. The chancellor did not completely rule out raising taxes in the event of a further slowdown in growth, but said now was not the time for ""significant"" tax hikes. He would not spell out the details of any further cuts, but said the Conservatives would stick to their manifesto pledge to protect some government departments. It is understood he would not look to increase the level of cuts dramatically but would initially seek to make further efficiencies in government departments. Mr Osborne said he wanted to ""root our country in the principle that we live within our means"" and would address this in the Budget. Explaining why he was planning to make further savings, the chancellor said the global economy had got ""markedly worse"", the UK's economy needed to be more productive, and information from the Office for National Statistics showed it was also smaller than expected.He said: ""Because of all of those things, we have to respond to those events. ""So that's what our plan is rooted in and it may require further reductions in spending. ""I'll address that in the Budget but people should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure.""He went on to say the ""whole purpose of our economic plan was to have a budget surplus"".By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorThe chancellor wants to keep to his self-imposed rule of getting the books into surplus by the end of the Parliament. He could relax that rule and slow down the pace of the cuts but that's not what appears to be on his agenda. Instead, it seems he'd rather find the money somewhere. He wouldn't say where he'd look for cuts, but you can assume departments ministers have already pledged to protect will be safe from further austerity. That of course means potentially tighter squeezes elsewhere. Read more from LauraLaura Kuenssberg: Osborne's change of EU tacticsDecisions about the level of potential future cuts will only be made once he receives the official assessments from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he added.The extra cuts would be likely to be made towards the end of the Parliament, before 2020. In his November statement, Mr Osborne watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments.He was able to do this due to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that by 2020 Mr Osborne would be thinking about potentially being prime minister and leading the Conservatives into the next general election.Mr Osborne believed having a surplus would show voters the Conservatives had ""fixed the economy"", he added.       Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the British people would end up paying for Mr Osborne's own failures.He accused the chancellor of having ""sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months - that his recovery is built on sand"".""Far from paying our way, Osborne's short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world,"" he said.""If the bankers' chancellor had been doing his job properly he would be collecting taxes from Google and other tax-dodgers. ""Instead he is threatening the British people with paying an even higher price for his own failures."""

Mick Taylor said his 15-year-old son was asked by police whether he was a UKIP activist, and has described police action as inappropriate.The procedure left him feeling ""like a terrorist"", Mr Taylor added.Police said Wildern School in Hedge End, Hampshire, acted in line with safeguarding procedures. UKIP said: ""We're certainly not extremists.""Under the new counter terror act, staff at schools are asked to identify children who may be influenced by extremist material.The school said it called 101 for advice after a student was viewing a range of different sites and was referred to a specialist team.""If my son had been accessing these websites on a regular basis - then maybe there would be cause for concern,"" Mr Taylor said.""But it's a one-off incident and I don't think it merited such an extreme section of the police coming in.""Head teacher Marie-Louise Litton said: ""I wish to make it absolutely clear that the decision to pursue the matter further was not made by the school.""A spokesman from Hampshire Constabulary said: ""The school contacted us in good faith and in complete accordance with their safeguarding procedures. ""We have a duty to respond to these concerns and we spoke to the pupil and his father informally about comments and internet usage at school."" No further action was taken.UKIP's deputy leader Paul Nuttall reacted angrily at the suggestion the party's website was flagged in this way. ""I don't know how you can be extremists when you have 22 MEPs, a member of Parliament, three lords and 500 councillors all over the country,"" he said. ""We're certainly not extremists."" "

This is on top of a 10% rise decided in August and backdated to the general election.The latest increase is an annual adjustment decided by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which takes into account average public sector pay rises.It is slightly higher than the 1% public sector pay cap introduced by Chancellor George Osborne.Ipsa says this is due to the fact it uses Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures as its benchmark. An Ipsa spokesman said: ""The ONS index takes account of promotions and bonuses which may explain why the figure is higher than the 1% wider public sector pay policy."""
2016-02-26,Irish election count due to begin,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35674465,"Counting in the Republic of Ireland's election is due to begin at 09:00 local time on Saturday.An exit poll commissioned by the Irish Times suggests that Fine Gael will remain the largest party with 26%. However Fianna Fáil, the main opposition, appears to be close behind on 23%. The Irish Times poll puts Sinn Féin at 15%, well ahead of Labour, the junior coalition partners, on 8%. The Irish broadcaster, RTE, is unveiling its own exit poll on Saturday morning. The early indications are that there was a turnout of about 66%.  Over three million people were entitled to vote in 40 constituencies, but not all did so.They are electing 157 TDs. The Ceann Comhairle (speaker) is automatically returned.Observers are predicting that it will be hard for any party to put together a coalition, which needs to have the support of 79 TDs.Polling stations opened at 07:00 local time on Friday and closed at 22:00. Opinion polls have consistently suggested there will be a hung Dáil (parliament), with Fine Gael, the main government party, expected to win the largest number of seats.Enda Kenny is hoping to become the country's first leader to be returned as Taoiseach (prime minister). Labour is expected to suffer heavy losses.Fianna Fáil is likely to make gains, but nowhere near the 40% it was once accustomed to.As for Sinn Féin, it will almost certainly improve on the 14 seats it currently has. Whether or not it comes close to doubling that number will become clearer once counting begins.The campaign was fought mainly over economic issues, with the government parties asking voters for their support to keep the recovery going at a time when international storm clouds are gathering.But the opposition parties countered that not everyone, especially outside of middle-class Dublin, is yet benefiting from the up-turn.That perceived lack of fairness is expected to hurt the coalition parties.The Republic of Ireland has had the biggest growing economy in the Eurozone for the last two years.In the last election five years ago, voters punished the once dominant Fianna Fáil for its role in the economic crash that required an EU-IMF bailout. The outgoing government was a coalition between the largest political party, Fine Gael, and the Labour Party.Led by Enda Kenny, the coalition had been in power for almost five years - since March 2011.They are being challenged by 13 other parties, including the largest opposition party, Fianna Fáil, led by Micheál Martin, and Sinn Féin, led by Gerry Adams.There are also a number of independents among the 552 candidates standing for election.TDs will be elected according to the single transferable vote (STV) system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to others.The election count is expected to last the weekend."

""I happen to think this idea that there is some third way, as some are suggesting, between in and out...is a complete fiction,"" he said. ""It is a very simple question on the ballot paper - you either stay in the EU or you leave.""People really need to understand it is a single decision, it is a final decision.""Mr Cameron said he believed the country would be ""better off"" if the UK remains in, challenging those who disagreed with him to acknowledge that exiting - a process which could take up to two years - would cause some ""economic pain"".He again insisted that he would not quit as prime minister if the UK voted to leave, arguing that the referendum was not about the ""future of any politician or political team"". ""This is a sovereign decision by the British people...If they vote to leave, I will carry it out.""Lord Howard, who led the Tories between 2003 and 2005, when he was a close political ally and mentor of Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, raised the possibility that EU leaders would have to think again about far-reaching reform in the immediate aftermath of an Out vote. ""I think it is quite likely that during that month they would say let's talk some more, let's see if we can reach a different agreement and perhaps you could have a second referendum,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""If, after a month or so they don't, then Article 50 would have to be triggered and negotiations to leave would begin.""He said he was not afraid of EU exit since, as the world's fifth largest economy, the UK would prosper outside the European Union and, as he put it, ""the Germans would still want to carry on selling us their BMWs and the French would still want to carry on selling us their wine"".After the Maastricht Treaty was rejected by voters in Denmark a batch of concessions were made, a second vote was held and the Treaty passed.Ireland's initial rejection of the Lisbon Treaty was also followed a second referendum and a different result.However, these referendums were on fundamental EU treaty change.Because the EU needs unanimous approval for its primary law to be changed these rejections stalled the whole EU machine and fix had to be found. The UK situation now is different.Read more from Ben on the likelihood of a second referendumHe rejected suggestions that negotiating a trade-based relationship with the EU, similar to that which Norway and Switzerland have, would leave the UK with the ""worst of all worlds"" - with reduced access to the single market but still bound by a lot of EU rules and regulations. ""Norway is a country of five million people. We are a country of 65 million people. We won't have Norwegian-style agreement with the EU, we will have a British style agreement.

""The primary goal [of the party] is to get us out of the European Union but, equally, as a fully-fledged political party, we'll be concentrating on those elections as well.""  UKIP has said it is making preparations for its ""first ever UK stronghold of elected politicians"" in Cardiff Bay.Its six main policies include a plan to halve the number of NHS senior managers and reintroduce grammar schools.However, with just over two months to go to the election, the party has still not finalised its candidate selections.Members have until next Friday to vote on UKIP's regional candidates.On Thursday, former national organiser John Atkinson resigned from the party, saying ""infighting"" had become a distraction from the EU referendum campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage and the party's Wales leader Nathan Gill will address the conference on Saturday.UKIP Wales' main policies for the assembly election are:UKIP decided to hold its spring conference in Wales as a launch pad for its campaign of this year's assembly election, where polls suggest the party could establish a strong bridgehead in Cardiff Bay.Things seldom go smoothly for UKIP though and the weeks leading up to the conference have been overshadowed by rows over candidate selections  and resignations from the party. It is embarrassing to say the least that as the party faithful gather in Llandudno, UKIP has yet to select candidates for the crucial regional list seats.  The announcement of the date for the European referendum will heighten interest in the conference and the party is certain to attempt to showcase the case for Brexit and for its own role in the 'Leave' campaign."

He told Radio 4's Today programme that, as the world's fifth largest economy, the UK would prosper outside the European Union, arguing that ""the Germans would still want to carry on selling us their BMWs and the French would still want to carry on selling us their wine"".""So it is in everyone's interest to want to have an agreement that allows each of us to have access to each other's markets.""Michael Howard was never the most popular politician with the public, but many of his party's grassroots felt he shared their views when he was home secretary.

2016-02-26,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria.

2016-02-26,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" The options for voters will be 'Remain a member of the European Union' and 'Leave the European Union'. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post.

The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR) in Strasbourg. The EHCR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the EHCR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part."

2016-02-26,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-26,Fear factor,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35672157,"Should we be afraid, very afraid? What Eurosceptics call Project Fear just took a new turn. Speaking to me in China, where he's attending a meeting of finance ministers from around the world,  Chancellor George Osborne used dramatic language to describe the risk to the UK economy if we vote to leave the European Union. He said that exit would be a ""profound economic shock"", in the words of one prominent Out campaigner, really ""upping the ante"". Mr Osborne is adamant that a decision to leave would genuinely imperil our economy at a time when jitters around the world mean there are already many risks. The chancellor said the economy faces more risks of uncertainty than at any point since the financial crisis in 2008 so, it would be the ""very worst time"" for Britain to take what he described as an ""enormous economic gamble"".Of course, those campaigning to leave the EU believe the country could be just as, if not even more prosperous outside the union than in. And until recently the chancellor and the prime minister both repeatedly said they would be ready to walk away from the EU if they refused to give the UK a new and improved deal. If he really believes it would be a huge economic calamity if we left, I asked him, would he really have been ready to leave? He says they really meant it and didn't rule it out. Having listened to him talk about what he believes is at stake, I'm not quite so sure.  "

That is the referendum choice. But then, to deploy former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld's famously cryptic phrase about the missing evidence for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, there are known unknowns: If Britain votes to leave the EU what terms of exit would Britain get? How would EU leaders react? Would they plead for Britain to stay, offer a fresh negotiation and hope the UK votes to stay in a second referendum? That is the scenario Leave campaigners want to paint. Former Tory leader Michael Howard is the latest - and most politically hefty - ""leaver"" to claim a second deal and referendum would be possible. Mr Howard said a no vote would ""shake EU leaders out of their complacency"". In the frenzied panic that would follow a vote to leave, his argument goes, EU leaders would have to come up with a better deal in their desperation to keep the UK in the club. After all, European leaders have spent the last months saying how dreadful it would be for one of its richest and biggest economies to check out. Talking up the chances of a second referendum has been a central tactic of the leave campaigns for months. In January the director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, told the Economist magazine the UK would not have to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately after a leave vote (the process that begins a member state's two year exit from the EU) and the final terms of Brexit could be put to voters in a second referendum. The tactic of talking up a second referendum is clear: Reassure nervous voters the referendum is a stepping stone not a leap into the unknown.So, is this plausible? Let's look at what people in Brussels are saying. For a start, David Cameron has said the idea of doing this all again is ""for the birds"". The UK government has said a Leave vote would mean going to Brussels and invoking Article 50 immediately. And let's return to the ballot paper. There is nothing on it that would give the prime minister a mandate to try and renegotiate again. Even if he tried to do that, the other 27 EU leaders would have to agree to restart renegotiations with Britain. Now that's not impossible. But from the statements of key EU players since the renegotiation deal was done it would seem very unlikely. For instance, last week Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel said bluntly there were ""no second chances"" on this. Days later, in a European Parliament debate discussing the UK agreement, politicians queued up to deliver the same message. European Council President Donald Tusk said if a majority in Britain vote to leave, ""that is what will happen"". Manfred Weber MEP, the leader of the largest group in the Parliament (the centre-right EPP) spelt it out: ""If people are being told in the United Kingdom that if they say no they will get a better deal, we have to say to them very clearly the agreement on the table is the agreement. There will be no follow up negotiations."" Liberal group leader Guy Verhofstadt said the same: ""Don't think after voting a no you can come back to the negotiation table,"" he said. ""This is about in or out. It's one or the other.""A second renegotiation? ""Non, nein, nee"" has been the message from Brussels. And the deal agreed by EU leaders last week explicitly says this is it. ""It is understood that, should the result of the referendum in the United Kingdom be for it to leave the European Union, the set of arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 above will cease to exist,"" reads the text.But wait a minute - what about all those European referendums re-run to get a different result? After the Maastricht Treaty was rejected by voters in Denmark a batch of concessions were made, a second vote was held and the Treaty passed. Ireland's initial rejection of the Lisbon Treaty was also followed by a second referendum and a different result. However, these referendums were on fundamental EU treaty change. Because the EU needs unanimous approval for its primary law to be changed these rejections stalled the whole EU machine and a fix had to be found. The UK situation now is different. This is a process the British government has chosen to begin. A UK exit would undoubtedly cause some anguish in the EU but it would not stop the project moving forward. There is also real concern in Brussels that any more special treatment for the UK could be contagious, a green light to other member states to try the same. Of course, only once the result is known will any of this become completely clear. If it's a vote to leave the EU the reality of the political crisis that would follow in Brussels may change minds. But for now, the suggestion the UK would be allowed back to the negotiating table is being met here in Brussels with exasperated derision. READ MORE: The truth behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-02-26,The EU questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35660681,"How does being in the EU affect me? What difference would it make to me and my life if we left?Let's be honest, few of us have ever had to give much, if any, thought to these questions. The fact we are members of a club of 28 nations is something most people take as a given - like the weather. However, now they are beginning to be asked as people to ponder how to vote in the EU referendum.I spent the early hours of Thursday morning in Swindon to learn how people were approaching one of the most significant decisions this country has faced in decades. As dawn rose over the frosty fields that surround Brinkworth Dairy, I stood by the cowshed with Ceri Cryer and her husband, Chad. Like all farmers, their lives and their livelihoods are closely linked to policies made in Brussels. The grants they receive - for keeping hedgerows in shape or for other environmentally friendly policies - are set by the EU. The rules that govern the hygiene of their dairy and the packaging of the cheese they make are set there too. Yet Ceri and Chad have very different views. She thinks there's no reason to imagine that if the rules and regulations were set in London they'd be any less strict. What's more, she fears farming would receive less, not more, support without the lobbying of countries such as France and Poland with long, proud traditions of supporting the rural economy. He, on the other hand, thinks there's no reason to doubt their farm would receive the same backing as it does now if the UK left the EU and every reason to think Britain would benefit from the freedom it would give. Down the road, at Lydiard Millicent Village Hall, I went a few rounds with a group of women who start their morning with a few jabs, uppercuts and hooks. Shona Watt - who runs the training classes here - spoke for many of her clients. She and her small business have very little to do with the EU. Yet she - and they - are fearful leaving might damage other businesses in this manufacturing town, home to Honda and BMW. Less trade for them might mean less money to spend on boxing classes for professional ladies. GP Sian Edwards sees this as a debate as much about people as it is about money. In a town that does not have the doctors it needs to cover the population it has, she worries uncontrolled immigration could put an intolerable strain on the NHS - even though she knows many of those immigrants may end up working for it. What, though, she wonders, would being out be like? My last - and frankly well deserved - stop was for a doorstep bacon sarnie at Dotty's Cafe in Swindon. There, too, immigration is a key concern. Graham Rowcliffe - the cafe's owner - told me we simply couldn't control our borders while being in the EU. It is, he is certain, time to leave.   His customers on Thursday morning were much less sure. David Pedley, chief executive of GWP Group, a packaging manufacturer employing about 100 people, thinks his products would sell whether we are in or out of the EU. Getting out might just free his business of those onerous Brussels rules and regulations. But he concedes he can't be sure the rest of Europe wouldn't use Brexit to try to put up artificial barriers to stop him competing with their companies. Accountant Laurence Harrison advises many small businesses in the town. He has no doubts - being in a big European club is the way to get business in a world increasingly dominated by economic giants such as China, India and the United States.One thing united all these people - a desire to know more. But there are many already groaning at the thought of ""four more months like this"". The answer, surely, is to use that time not to listen to slogans and sound bites but to the experiences of other people and to the answers to the questions we've never before needed to ask.

2016-02-26,An unknown future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35648948,"Earnest, passionate, and slightly shiny - the prime minister is in his element. The messy diplomacy behind him, he is selling a simple message. Whether on Andrew Marr's comfy chair, behind a podium in Downing Street or on the front bench he is campaigning, slamming home a single point we will hear over and over again. With no deviation or hesitation, but constant repetition, he is telling those thinking of voting to leave the European Union they are contemplating a ""leap in the dark"". We will have to do our best over the coming weeks to find a torch and shine a little light into the shadows. It won't be easy. In truth, no post-referendum future is picked out by a spotlight, for with an EU in crisis over migration, contemplating closer banking union, the status quo is not a steady state.  Even those who believe in historical or metaphysical predetermination do not claim to be able to follow the dark thread very far beyond the present.Follow updates on the BBC's live referendum pageThe UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowUK and the EU: Better off out or in?Remain v Leave: Where do MPs stand?I'm itching to watch the last episode of Man in the High Castle, but the European debate has kept me from the couch. It is a TV drama set in a world where the Nazis win the war and the US is conquered, and divided between them and the Japanese Empire. There is no doubt counterfactual history makes for good ""faction"". Some think it is academically pointless, others that it has some merit.I have always thought it a worthwhile tool for thinking about causes and consequences, what is shaped by heroes and villains who grip history in their hands and what is moulded by amorphous forces of the economy.  But perhaps what we need is conjectural history.Ironically, the key to what the UK would be like after leaving the EU is in the hands of the very organisation we would have just voted to leave. The reaction of the EU itself would make all the difference between an amicable divorce and a crime of passion. Discerning how 27 other governments will behave is never easy at the best of times. Predicting their reaction to a hypothetical vote in four months' time might seem as pointless as asking Schrodinger about the health of his cat. But trends will become clearer as the weeks pass. There is already a grave worry on the Continent that the British disease could be catching. The word they use is ""contagion"".  If we vote to leave, there are those in France and Germany who won't want to make it a comfortable experience. If it looks too easy, others may be encouraged to follow. The Danish People's Party is already keen. But the big worry among the elite is France. Front National leader Marine Le Pen says she would be proud to call herself ""Madame Frexit"". If Britain's departure would leave a gaping hole in the EU, France following suit would pull out the foundation stones. The EU might survive in name, but it would become a very different creature if France left, or even had the same semi-detached relationship Mr Cameron is proposing for Britain. The ""outers"" might be right that a rational EU would not want to punish and alienate the UK, but would be quick to arrange a mutually beneficial arrangement that would encourage trade to continue much as before. There may be voices raised against those who fear the spread of the British disease. I suspect we could learn much by shining that torch in the direction of German industrialists, French financiers and Dutch manufacturers  and find out what they are telling their governments. But European politicians (as well of the rest of us) might want to know what sort of Britain they would face. The ""outers"" are a campaign for a one-off vote, not a nascent government. We don't know whether a government freed to close its borders to all other Europeans would actually do so. Would there be a quota system or a points system, a free for all or an outright ban, or perhaps a bar on Bulgarians but not Belgians? There is a big difference between these positions.  We must ask those who want the choice to be available, but we cannot know for sure what they would do with their new-found freedom.At one extreme, Britain out of the EU could negotiate access to the single market, free movement of our citizens and some voice in debates. At the other end, we could need visas to visit any EU country, suffer punitive tariffs on our goods and be given the cold shoulder.As the vote grows closer, I fully expect headlines on the lines of: ""France warns UK citizens will need visas"".  There is another dark uncertainty.The prime minister has dismissed Boris Johnson's hint he favours a Leave vote followed by another negotiation, a better deal, and then a vote to stay. Other EU prime ministers and presidents are bound to be equally insistent this is a fantasy too far.The notion is certainly fraught with difficulties - not least the thought of a new Conservative leader, even a charismatic blond bombshell, executing a nimble pirouette to turn about face in defiance of a popular vote and thus deliberately reneging on the will of the people. But a pound to a pfennig someone would suggest it was worth a punt, and the mood across Europe might be in favour of making hitherto undreamt of concessions. Or they might say ""stuff it"" and leave the new leader gently rotating in the breeze. One way or another, we will be inching into the darkness in June - we will do what we can to illuminate the possible and the probable."
2016-02-26,Is a second EU referendum plausible?,https://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/web/20160227034508/http://bbc.in/1KQkI0e,
2016-02-26,Just a game...,https://web.archive.org//web/20160227034508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35631257,"It was one of the great political upsets of British post-War history. In 1970, Britain's Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was widely expected to hold on to power in a general election he himself had called. But when the voting verdict came in, Mr Wilson found himself being bundled out of Downing Street, and the Conservative leader, Edward Heath, taking his place.  And some sought solace in a simple explanation: football.England had lost a World Cup quarter-final tie just four days before the vote, and this was no ordinary match.Defeat had come at the hands of West Germany, the team England had beaten just four years previously to win the World Cup. And right up until the end of the game, another England victory had seemed on the cards, with the side 2-0 up at half-time. But then three German goals came in, one after the other.""The sense of letdown could not have been greater,"" says Kier Radnedge, who watched the game as a young football reporter. He believes it may well have affected the way some people then voted.""It deflated the mood in the nation,"" he says, ""therefore, they looked for something new. Something new in that case was voting in a new government.""Forty-six years later, the people of Britain will once again be voting in the wake of an international football tie, and that vote could prove more crucial than any individual election. A referendum will decide whether or not the UK should remain a member of the European Union. But just days beforehand, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will play the last of their group matches in the Euro 2016 championships.""If England, Wales or Northern Ireland have won their group, then it will make people feel good about being part of Europe,"" says Mark Perryman, founder of the company Football Philosophy. ""If they come home early, people will ask, 'Do we really want to part of this continent?'""Campaigning in the referendum will not revolve around footballing matters, of course. Debate on EU membership has tended to focus on economic issues, particularly whether a Britain out of the EU would be able to trade as easily with EU member states. Also crucial is immigration, opponents of the EU saying membership allows too many foreigners to live and work in Britain.  Supporters, by contrast, say foreign workers have been a benefit to the UK, not a cost.But Mr Radnedge says too much credence is given to rationality in political argument.""People are swayed by their moods,"" he says about voting. ""It really is a lot to do with how people are feeling on the day."" Mr Radnedge admits the effects of a football match would be marginal, but then marginal votes count in what may be a close-run contest. ""It is illogical, but then people are illogical,"" he says.Whoever wins or loses, the European Championships will certainly compete with the referendum campaign for space on newspaper front pages, and on radio and television news bulletins. And that is not good for the government in this case, according to a former government spin doctor.Charlie Whelan, who served as the press man for Gordon Brown when he was Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, says they always avoided any political event clashing with a major football tie.""You want to control the news agenda as much as you can,"" Mr Whelan says.  ""If you have no idea what's going to happen on any given day, the agenda is set by 22 guys kicking round a football."" But the clash of ballot and ball this June will not represent a completely new mixing of two otherwise-separate fields, because football has always provided an outlet for nationalist passions, and therefore raised questions of nationhood and national identity. The rise of English nationalism was illustrated by England supporters starting to wave the flag of St George, rather than the Union Jack. And the presence of so many European players in British club teams has made supporters question whether they want the best team money can buy, or whether instead fewer foreigners should be allowed on board, in order to nurture more native talent. ""Football clubs are the most European institutions [in Britain],"" Mr Perryman says, ""their players, the managers, the owners, the sponsors. Do supporters like that? Yes - but only if their team is winning."" For more on this story listen to Paul Moss's report on The World Tonight."

And the notion that the UK leaving the EU would cause an economic shock is absurd.""Fifteen of the members of the G20 are outside the EU, and that hasn't caused an economic shock. Indeed, most of them are doing better than most of the members of the European Union.""The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU vote: Where the cabinet and other MPs standEU reform deal: What Cameron wanted and what he gotUKIP leader Nigel Farage said the G20 announcement was ""no surprise"" as it was ""mates helping each other out"".""I'm not surprised that big government gets together to support David Cameron,"" he added.""This is big banks, big business, big government all scratching each other's backs. I don't think that impresses voters.""Officials travelling with Mr Osborne say the mention of the UK's referendum in the G20 meeting's final communique is unusual. Mr Osborne has denied he pushed for it.The chancellor told the BBC: ""The financial leaders of the world's biggest countries have given their unanimous verdict and they say that a British exit from the EU would be a shock to the world economy.""And if it's a shock to the world economy imagine what it would do to Britain.""He added: ""This isn't some adventurous journey into the unknown, with all the humour attached to it, this is deadly serious.""With the gleaming early spring sunshine behind him, as he stood on the bank of Shanghai's Huangpu river, the chancellor said he was ""deadly serious"".He's not the only one. It seems the other 19 leaders at the G20 agree about the ""shock"", as they've called it, if the UK walked out of the EU.It's not a big surprise. The president of hosts China made it clear last year during his Chequers stay that he wants Britain In.But then again China doesn't really do intervention in domestic politics.George Osborne will be pleased to have this significant and very public diplomatic backing as he sits on the plane back home tonight.There's a whiff of the Scottish referendum campaign about it though, when various foreign leaders lined up behind the government position.A senior official from the Treasury told the BBC the chancellor's US counterpart had raised the issue during the meeting, as did others, including senior Chinese officials and Ms Lagarde.US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew later urged UK voters to ""consider the impact"" of voting to leave, and said the White House believed it was in the UK's ""national security interests"" to remain in the union.  Elsewhere, Prime Minister David Cameron was in Northern Ireland as part of his UK tour to persuade voters that membership of a reformed EU is in their best interests.CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn described the potential consequences of the UK leaving the EU as an ""evident risk"".""Those who wish to leave must put forward a clear economic case, explaining how being outside the EU will enhance jobs, growth and prosperity in the UK and across Europe.""The majority - but not all - of CBI members want the UK to remain in a reformed EU,"" she added.Meanwhile, London Mayor Boris Johnson has clarified his position over the idea that a vote to leave the EU could force Brussels to give Britain a better deal over its membership and trigger a second referendum.Mr Johnson had previously suggested that only by voting to leave would the UK ""get the change we need"".But in The Times, Mr Johnson stated categorically: ""Out is out"".The UK will vote on whether to leave or remain in the EU on 23 June.Mr Cameron set the date last weekend after agreeing a deal with fellow EU leaders about a renegotiation of the UK's EU membership.

Where peace is possible in so many places.""You don't achieve peace by planning for war, grabbing resources and not respecting each other's human rights.""He added: ""Today's demonstration is an expression of many people's opinions and views. I'm here because I believe in a nuclear-free Britain and a nuclear-free future.""Mr Corbyn has asked shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to carry out a review of Labour defence policy, including its stance on Trident renewal.The Labour leader supports unilateral disarmament but some members of the shadow cabinet, including shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, are in favour of Trident.SNP leader Ms Sturgeon said the norm in the world today was to be nuclear-free.""It is the exception to the rule to possess nuclear weapons, let that message ring out loudly and clearly,""  she said.""The use of Trident nuclear weapons would bring about human devastation and suffering on an unimaginable scale.""Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: ""The world has been and continues to be an unstable and unpredictable place but there are some values that we should hold on to through peace, through war, through instability and unpredictability.""It is never acceptable, it is never justifiable to unleash weapons of mass destruction on a population. Nuclear weapons belong in the dustbin of history alongside the Cold War.""Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas described nuclear weapons as ""a Cold War relic"".""To contemplate using nuclear weapons is both illegal and immoral,"" she said.Actress and campaigner Vanessa Redgrave also spoke at the Stop Trident event, which was organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.Supporters say Trident is indispensable for protecting the UK's security, and the nuclear defence industry is also a major employer. Replacing Trident was a Conservative manifesto pledge at the general election.A Commons vote on Trident renewal is expected to be held later this year."

Asked whether he had given up on the idea of a second referendum, Mr Johnson added: ""I don't think it would be necessary.""He told the paper the vote was a golden opportunity ""to take back control, to renew our approach to law making, to strike new trade deals around the world, to galvanise our economy and politics and to give people confidence back in their country"".""The advantage of a 'no' vote is that it would jolt the whole system in Europe,"" he said.

Lord Howard, who led the Tories between 2003 and 2005, said on Friday that EU leaders would have to think again about far-reaching reform in the immediate aftermath of an Out vote.The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the suggestion an Out vote could lead to a second referendum had the political advantage of reassuring voters who were tempted to leave the EU but were nervous about the potential consequences. But Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed the idea as a ""complete fiction"".He added: ""It is a very simple question on the ballot paper - you either stay in the EU or you leave.""Chancellor George Osborne has said if Britain voted to leave the EU it would cause a profound economic shock.He said it was the ""very worst time"" for Britain to take such an ""enormous economic gamble""."
2016-02-27,MP tells of 'terrifying' Turkish ordeal,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35679485,"A Scottish MP who was detained by security forces in Turkey has described the experience as ""terrifying"".Natalie McGarry, who represents Glasgow East, was briefly held by authorities near a security checkpoint in the south-east of the country on Thursday.Her lawyer later confirmed security forces became ""alarmed"" because she had her mobile phone out at a checkpoint. He said she was ""recording the sound of bombs"" from Turkish forces falling on a Kurdish area of Sur in Diyarbakir.The area is a flashpoint in the conflict between the Turkish government and the country's Kurdish population.Ms McGarry, who was visiting Turkey as part of a delegation to the country, revealed she was ""very pleased"" to have landed at Heathrow airport. Writing in a series of tweets on Saturday, she said: ""I was forcibly removed from the street by a man who pushed me repeatedly and would've hit me but for intervention of younger colleagues.""I was denied access to an interpreter and taken into a shack behind the demarcation line which was filled with guns.""She said she was ""relieved"" after an interpreter was allowed in after 45 minutes.She continued: ""My absolute admiration to fellow delegates who stayed to support me & were increasingly worried by the shouting & swearing.""Thank you also to the British Embassy who acted so swiftly to help secure my release. And everyone locally who was contacted & put pressure.""Thanks also to the Kurdish population of Sur who came to welcome me out and hugged me when I cried. And they brought me chai and thanks.""Ms McGarry added: ""I freely admit to crying when I was released. It was a terrifying experience albeit it only lasted a couple of hours.""I cannot imagine if life was a constant struggle of fear like that everyday which is why Turkey's Nato partners need to demand it stop.""Ms McGarry sits as an independent MP. She withdrew from the SNP whip at Westminster in November after the Women for Independence group called in police over allegations that campaign funds appeared to have gone missing. She has denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this year, the MP was involved in a high-profile Twitter spat with Harry Potter author JK Rowling.  after resigning the SNP whip in the wake of an ongoing police investigation into missing donations from Women for Independence, the pro-Scottish independence group she founded. She denies any wrongdoing."

Mick Taylor said his 15-year-old son was asked by police whether he was a UKIP activist, and has described police action as inappropriate.The procedure left him feeling ""like a terrorist"", Mr Taylor added.Police said Wildern School in Hedge End, Hampshire, acted in line with safeguarding procedures. UKIP said: ""We're certainly not extremists.""Under the new counter terror act, staff at schools are asked to identify children who may be influenced by extremist material.The school said it called 101 for advice after a student was viewing a range of different sites and was referred to a specialist team.""If my son had been accessing these websites on a regular basis - then maybe there would be cause for concern,"" Mr Taylor said.""But it's a one-off incident and I don't think it merited such an extreme section of the police coming in.""Head teacher Marie-Louise Litton said: ""I wish to make it absolutely clear that the decision to pursue the matter further was not made by the school.""A spokesman from Hampshire Constabulary said: ""The school contacted us in good faith and in complete accordance with their safeguarding procedures. ""We have a duty to respond to these concerns and we spoke to the pupil and his father informally about comments and internet usage at school."" No further action was taken.UKIP's deputy leader Paul Nuttall reacted angrily at the suggestion the party's website was flagged in this way. ""I don't know how you can be extremists when you have 22 MEPs, a member of Parliament, three lords and 500 councillors all over the country,"" he said. ""We're certainly not extremists."" "
2016-02-27,Party backs having more women candidates,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35678350,"The Scottish Liberal Democrats have backed plans to increase the number of female candidates in future parliamentary elections. The party's conference voted to ensure women were selected in the five most winnable Westminster seats and five of the 10 most winnable Holyrood seats. Leader Willie Rennie personally pushed for the change.The move will not affect the male-dominated candidate selection for this May's Scottish Parliament election.Delegates also confirmed that the lead candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election would be a woman.Following the conference decision, Mr Rennie said: ""Passing these proposals sends a powerful message that we are changing. This represents a big shift and will open up opportunities for new women candidates. ""And it is working already with new women now considering standing for parliament for the first time.""We have bold, positive and ambitious plans for the next five years and we will now be joined by people from a much more diverse range of backgrounds as we take them forwards.""As the leader of this progressive party I am delighted that we have embraced change that means we can be more like the people we are seeking to represent.""The Scottish Liberal Democrats are holding their two-day annual conference at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh."
2016-02-27,Osborne warns of further spending cuts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35672158,"Chancellor George Osborne has warned he may have to make fresh cuts to public spending in next month's Budget.Mr Osborne told the BBC global economic turmoil and slower growth meant ""we may need to undertake further reductions"".He slowed the pace of cuts in the last spending review, but suggested savings could be announced in his 16 March Budget statement as figures showed the UK economy was smaller than expected.Labour's John McDonnell said it was ""a total humiliation"" for Mr Osborne.Speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg during a visit to China, Mr Osborne said he would rather look for extra cuts now than risk breaking his own manifesto commitment to achieve a surplus in the budget by the end of this Parliament, in 2020. The chancellor did not completely rule out raising taxes in the event of a further slowdown in growth, but said now was not the time for ""significant"" tax hikes. He would not spell out the details of any further cuts, but said the Conservatives would stick to their manifesto pledge to protect some government departments. It is understood he would not look to increase the level of cuts dramatically but would initially seek to make further efficiencies in government departments. Mr Osborne said he wanted to ""root our country in the principle that we live within our means"" and would address this in the Budget. Explaining why he was planning to make further savings, the chancellor said the global economy had got ""markedly worse"", the UK's economy needed to be more productive, and information from the Office for National Statistics showed it was also smaller than expected.He said: ""Because of all of those things, we have to respond to those events. ""So that's what our plan is rooted in and it may require further reductions in spending. ""I'll address that in the Budget but people should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure.""He went on to say the ""whole purpose of our economic plan was to have a budget surplus"".By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorThe chancellor wants to keep to his self-imposed rule of getting the books into surplus by the end of the Parliament. He could relax that rule and slow down the pace of the cuts but that's not what appears to be on his agenda. Instead, it seems he'd rather find the money somewhere. He wouldn't say where he'd look for cuts, but you can assume departments ministers have already pledged to protect will be safe from further austerity. That of course means potentially tighter squeezes elsewhere. Read more from LauraLaura Kuenssberg: Osborne's change of EU tacticsDecisions about the level of potential future cuts will only be made once he receives the official assessments from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he added.The extra cuts would be likely to be made towards the end of the Parliament, before 2020. In his November statement, Mr Osborne watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments.He was able to do this due to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that by 2020 Mr Osborne would be thinking about potentially being prime minister and leading the Conservatives into the next general election.Mr Osborne believed having a surplus would show voters the Conservatives had ""fixed the economy"", he added.       Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the British people would end up paying for Mr Osborne's own failures.He accused the chancellor of having ""sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months - that his recovery is built on sand"".""Far from paying our way, Osborne's short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world,"" he said.""If the bankers' chancellor had been doing his job properly he would be collecting taxes from Google and other tax-dodgers. ""Instead he is threatening the British people with paying an even higher price for his own failures."""

This is on top of a 10% rise decided in August and backdated to the general election.The latest increase is an annual adjustment decided by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which takes into account average public sector pay rises.It is slightly higher than the 1% public sector pay cap introduced by Chancellor George Osborne.Ipsa says this is due to the fact it uses Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures as its benchmark. An Ipsa spokesman said: ""The ONS index takes account of promotions and bonuses which may explain why the figure is higher than the 1% wider public sector pay policy."""
2016-02-27,Irish government 'will not be returned',https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35674465,"Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny has conceded that the existing Fine Gael-Labour coalition government will not be returned in the Republic of Ireland general election.It is likely Fine Gael will remain the largest party, but with a narrow lead over the main opposition, Fianna Fáil.Just over a third of the seats for the Dáil (Irish parliament) have been filled.Polls show Sinn Féin, smaller parties and Independents are also doing well. Mr Kenny, Labour Party leader Joan Burton and Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary-Lou McDonald have all retained their seats.However, Fine Gael's former justice minister Alan Shatter and Alex White, the Labour Party's communications minister, have not been returned to parliament.Mr Kenny said the voting showed that the existing government will not regain power.""This is a disappointment for the Fine Gael party,"" he said. ""Obviously whether you can argue about the people's decision, you cannot argue with it.""So clearly, the government of Fine Gael and Labour are not going to be returned to office.""He added that the ""majority government option is gone"" but he will wait for the full results and consider options on how to form a government ""very carefully"".""Clearly the country needs a government and must have one,"" he said.Joan Burton said she was ""very, very disappointed"" that many Labour Party candidates would not be elected to parliament.""All I can say is that the Labour Party is at the fight for justice and social justice in Ireland and we will continue that fight in the next Dáil, even if our numbers are diminished.""When asked about how a government will be formed, she said that all parliamentary members would have to ""work to do whatever is best for the people of our country"".Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin described the election as an ""extraordinary vote"" and said he was ""very pleased"".""A lot will depend on the destination of the last seats in many constituencies, it's a bit too early to be definitive, but it's clear we're going to have a good day,"" he said.Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary-Lou McDonald said that she expects the party will be putting leader Gerry Adams forward to be the next taoiseach.""It's early in the day but I think if this election demonstrates anything, it is that there is now, or should be, no sense from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that they have some divine right to govern - they don't,"" she saidMany believe the expected result could make negotiations on forming a new government extremely difficult.Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had indicated that they would not go into coalition with each other.However, pressure is expected to mount on them to come to some form of arrangement that may take several weeks to arrive at.If borne out by the count, the vote shares would result in a hung Dáil (parliament), but with Fine Gael still taking the largest number of seats.Over three million people were entitled to vote in Friday's poll, that will return 157 members of parliament, known as TDs. The ceann comhairle (speaker) is automatically returned.Although the election count is a long and gruelling process, there have been some lighter moments including a silver eternity ring that was found in a ballot box and one voter who gave his number one to UFC champion Conor McGregor.Meanwhile, one person swapped the Oscars in Hollywood for a count centre in County Cavan in order to support a politician.Eamon Farrell, the brother of actor Colin Farrell, had a ticket for the star-studded ceremony but decided instead to travel to the count centre in order to show his backing for Arts Minister Heather Humphries. The election campaign was fought mainly over economic issues, with the government parties asking voters for their support to keep the recovery going at a time when international storm clouds are gathering.But the opposition parties countered that not everyone, especially outside of middle-class Dublin, is yet benefiting from the up-turn.The Republic of Ireland has had the biggest growing economy in the eurozone for the last two years.TDs will be elected according to the single transferable vote (STV) system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to others."

""I happen to think this idea that there is some third way, as some are suggesting, between in and out...is a complete fiction,"" he said. ""It is a very simple question on the ballot paper - you either stay in the EU or you leave.""People really need to understand it is a single decision, it is a final decision.""Mr Cameron said he believed the country would be ""better off"" if the UK remains in, challenging those who disagreed with him to acknowledge that exiting - a process which could take up to two years - would cause some ""economic pain"".He again insisted that he would not quit as prime minister if the UK voted to leave, arguing that the referendum was not about the ""future of any politician or political team"". ""This is a sovereign decision by the British people...If they vote to leave, I will carry it out.""Lord Howard, who led the Tories between 2003 and 2005, when he was a close political ally and mentor of Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, raised the possibility that EU leaders would have to think again about far-reaching reform in the immediate aftermath of an Out vote. ""I think it is quite likely that during that month they would say let's talk some more, let's see if we can reach a different agreement and perhaps you could have a second referendum,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""If, after a month or so they don't, then Article 50 would have to be triggered and negotiations to leave would begin.""He said he was not afraid of EU exit since, as the world's fifth largest economy, the UK would prosper outside the European Union and, as he put it, ""the Germans would still want to carry on selling us their BMWs and the French would still want to carry on selling us their wine"".After the Maastricht Treaty was rejected by voters in Denmark a batch of concessions were made, a second vote was held and the Treaty passed.Ireland's initial rejection of the Lisbon Treaty was also followed a second referendum and a different result.However, these referendums were on fundamental EU treaty change.Because the EU needs unanimous approval for its primary law to be changed these rejections stalled the whole EU machine and fix had to be found. The UK situation now is different.Read more from Ben on the likelihood of a second referendumHe rejected suggestions that negotiating a trade-based relationship with the EU, similar to that which Norway and Switzerland have, would leave the UK with the ""worst of all worlds"" - with reduced access to the single market but still bound by a lot of EU rules and regulations. ""Norway is a country of five million people. We are a country of 65 million people. We won't have Norwegian-style agreement with the EU, we will have a British style agreement. ""We need a bit of self-belief and national self confidence. We are a great country - everyone wants access to our market. We won't be supplicants.""Meanwhile, Chancellor George Osborne has warned against taking an ""enormous economic gamble"", claiming that a vote to leave the EU would cause a profound economic shock and it was the ""very worst time"" for such a move.Speaking in Shanghai, where he is attending a meeting of G20 finance ministers, Mr Osborne told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the economy faces more risks of uncertainty than at any point since the financial crisis in 2008.Mr Osborne said talk of leaving the EU was ""not some political parlour game"", highlighting the recent fall in the value of the sterling to illustrate his point. ""This is about people's jobs and their livelihoods and their living standards, and in my judgement as chancellor leaving the EU would represent a profound economic shock for our country, for all of us and I'm going to do everything I can to prevent that happening."""

2016-02-27,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had ""never, ever met or spoken to"" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was ""passionate"" about.Shadow work and pensions secretary - Owen SmithThe former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a ""great honour"" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow defence secretary - Emily ThornberryThe Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government. Shadow communities and local government secretary - Jon TrickettMr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a ""gulf between the population and political class"".Shadow energy and climate change secretary - Lisa NandyThe Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Shadow Commons leader - Chris BryantThe MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow transport secretary - Lilian GreenwoodThe Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary - Vernon CoakerThe MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.Shadow international development secretary - Diane AbbottAnother left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow Scotland secretary - Ian MurrayHe continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.Shadow Wales secretary - Nia GriffithThe MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was ""very honoured"" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary - Kerry McCarthyThe Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow women and equalities minister - Kate GreenThe former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow culture, media and sport secretary - Maria EagleThe identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle.

2016-02-27,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-27,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday 23 June. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" The options for voters will be 'Remain a member of the European Union' and 'Leave the European Union'. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR) in Strasbourg. The EHCR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the EHCR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part."

2016-02-27,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-27,Toasting good health,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35679377,"It began as a throwaway line in a diary column I wrote to mark my traumatic return to full-time work at the BBC. Traumatic because my debut on BBC Radio 4's Today programme was memorable largely for the scratchy sound of a voice struggling to cope with the demands I was making of it, after it was damaged in an otherwise highly successful operation to remove a tumour. ""I plan to cheer myself at the inaugural dinner of the Survivors' Club,"" I wrote referring to an idea my esteemed BBC colleague Frank Gardner (shot) had proposed to Andrew Marr (stroke), George Alagiah (cancer) and myself (cancer). I wasn't sure that we would ever get round to breaking bread or supping wine, but wrote that I proposed that rule one of the club should state: ""Talking about your medical condition is strictly prohibited."" Any breach would be punishable by picking up the bill. This week I'm delighted to report that we had that inaugural meal - a lunch as it happens. The photo of us toasting our survival has been shared by thousands on social media and we are all overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity of the comments people have added. I'm afraid to say that we all breached rule one. However, no-one did so to complain about what they'd gone through - what would be the point when others had gone through so much worse?No-one dwelt on what they could no longer do. There was, instead, good news to be shared about small steps in the recovery process, or of the absurdities and indignities that are faced daily by people who are unwell or disabled. They are not my stories to tell but I now have in my mind the faces of airport security officials whose demands for the removal of vital medical equipment were greeted somewhat dustily.  What I think we all share is a sense of how lucky we have been. Not to face a life-threatening illness - or in Frank's case to be shot - of course, but to have done so with superb medical support, the backing of family, friends and colleagues and public support on an extraordinary scale. For some, illness is best faced in private with a stiff upper lip. For others, the pain and anxiety is lessened by sharing it. There is no right answer. Each must make their own decision. Some of that choice is removed if you do the jobs we do. There are many people - not least colleagues in the BBC - who face these challenges alone. Many too who are not so lucky with their recoveries.However, I hope that knowing what we've been through and, to some extent, come through will help others facing a much lonelier struggle. If that doesn't cheer you up, perhaps one Survivors' Club anecdote will. A fellow broadcaster - no names I'm afraid - was asked by his doctor whether it was difficult to speak on TV while a producer said something completely different in your ear. The inquiry came in the middle of an uncomfortable and intimate examination. The answer: ""It's not nearly as difficult as talking to you when you've got your hand up my….""Most of the time we did what four BBC employees gathered together always do - gossiped and bitched about our colleagues and bosses. However, let me reassure you that no licence fees were spent that lunchtime.Since we had all broken rule one, we split the bill.Nick Robinson is a presenter on BBC Radio 4's Today programme and a former BBC political editor."
2016-02-27,Fear factor,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35672157,"Should we be afraid, very afraid? What Eurosceptics call Project Fear just took a new turn. Speaking to me in China, where he's attending a meeting of finance ministers from around the world,  Chancellor George Osborne used dramatic language to describe the risk to the UK economy if we vote to leave the European Union. He said that exit would be a ""profound economic shock"", in the words of one prominent Out campaigner, really ""upping the ante"". Mr Osborne is adamant that a decision to leave would genuinely imperil our economy at a time when jitters around the world mean there are already many risks. The chancellor said the economy faces more risks of uncertainty than at any point since the financial crisis in 2008 so, it would be the ""very worst time"" for Britain to take what he described as an ""enormous economic gamble"".Of course, those campaigning to leave the EU believe the country could be just as, if not even more prosperous outside the union than in. And until recently the chancellor and the prime minister both repeatedly said they would be ready to walk away from the EU if they refused to give the UK a new and improved deal. If he really believes it would be a huge economic calamity if we left, I asked him, would he really have been ready to leave? He says they really meant it and didn't rule it out. Having listened to him talk about what he believes is at stake, I'm not quite so sure.  "
2016-02-27,Double or quit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35670906,"There is a known known: On 23 June voters in the UK will decide whether to remain in the European Union or leave. That is the referendum choice. But then, to deploy former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld's famously cryptic phrase about the missing evidence for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, there are known unknowns: If Britain votes to leave the EU what terms of exit would Britain get? How would EU leaders react? Would they plead for Britain to stay, offer a fresh negotiation and hope the UK votes to stay in a second referendum? That is the scenario Leave campaigners want to paint. Former Tory leader Michael Howard is the latest - and most politically hefty - ""leaver"" to claim a second deal and referendum would be possible. Mr Howard said a no vote would ""shake EU leaders out of their complacency"". In the frenzied panic that would follow a vote to leave, his argument goes, EU leaders would have to come up with a better deal in their desperation to keep the UK in the club. After all, European leaders have spent the last months saying how dreadful it would be for one of its richest and biggest economies to check out. Talking up the chances of a second referendum has been a central tactic of the leave campaigns for months. In January the director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, told the Economist magazine the UK would not have to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately after a leave vote (the process that begins a member state's two year exit from the EU) and the final terms of Brexit could be put to voters in a second referendum. The tactic of talking up a second referendum is clear: Reassure nervous voters the referendum is a stepping stone not a leap into the unknown.So, is this plausible? Let's look at what people in Brussels are saying. For a start, David Cameron has said the idea of doing this all again is ""for the birds"". The UK government has said a Leave vote would mean going to Brussels and invoking Article 50 immediately. And let's return to the ballot paper. There is nothing on it that would give the prime minister a mandate to try and renegotiate again. Even if he tried to do that, the other 27 EU leaders would have to agree to restart renegotiations with Britain. Now that's not impossible. But from the statements of key EU players since the renegotiation deal was done it would seem very unlikely. For instance, last week Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel said bluntly there were ""no second chances"" on this. Days later, in a European Parliament debate discussing the UK agreement, politicians queued up to deliver the same message. European Council President Donald Tusk said if a majority in Britain vote to leave, ""that is what will happen"". Manfred Weber MEP, the leader of the largest group in the Parliament (the centre-right EPP) spelt it out: ""If people are being told in the United Kingdom that if they say no they will get a better deal, we have to say to them very clearly the agreement on the table is the agreement. There will be no follow up negotiations."" Liberal group leader Guy Verhofstadt said the same: ""Don't think after voting a no you can come back to the negotiation table,"" he said. ""This is about in or out. It's one or the other.""A second renegotiation? ""Non, nein, nee"" has been the message from Brussels. And the deal agreed by EU leaders last week explicitly says this is it. ""It is understood that, should the result of the referendum in the United Kingdom be for it to leave the European Union, the set of arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 above will cease to exist,"" reads the text.But wait a minute - what about all those European referendums re-run to get a different result? After the Maastricht Treaty was rejected by voters in Denmark a batch of concessions were made, a second vote was held and the Treaty passed. Ireland's initial rejection of the Lisbon Treaty was also followed by a second referendum and a different result. However, these referendums were on fundamental EU treaty change. Because the EU needs unanimous approval for its primary law to be changed these rejections stalled the whole EU machine and a fix had to be found. The UK situation now is different. This is a process the British government has chosen to begin. A UK exit would undoubtedly cause some anguish in the EU but it would not stop the project moving forward. There is also real concern in Brussels that any more special treatment for the UK could be contagious, a green light to other member states to try the same. Of course, only once the result is known will any of this become completely clear. If it's a vote to leave the EU the reality of the political crisis that would follow in Brussels may change minds. But for now, the suggestion the UK would be allowed back to the negotiating table is being met here in Brussels with exasperated derision. READ MORE: The truth behind claims in the EU debate"
2016-02-27,The EU questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35660681,"How does being in the EU affect me? What difference would it make to me and my life if we left?Let's be honest, few of us have ever had to give much, if any, thought to these questions. The fact we are members of a club of 28 nations is something most people take as a given - like the weather. However, now they are beginning to be asked as people to ponder how to vote in the EU referendum.I spent the early hours of Thursday morning in Swindon to learn how people were approaching one of the most significant decisions this country has faced in decades. As dawn rose over the frosty fields that surround Brinkworth Dairy, I stood by the cowshed with Ceri Cryer and her husband, Chad. Like all farmers, their lives and their livelihoods are closely linked to policies made in Brussels. The grants they receive - for keeping hedgerows in shape or for other environmentally friendly policies - are set by the EU. The rules that govern the hygiene of their dairy and the packaging of the cheese they make are set there too. Yet Ceri and Chad have very different views. She thinks there's no reason to imagine that if the rules and regulations were set in London they'd be any less strict. What's more, she fears farming would receive less, not more, support without the lobbying of countries such as France and Poland with long, proud traditions of supporting the rural economy. He, on the other hand, thinks there's no reason to doubt their farm would receive the same backing as it does now if the UK left the EU and every reason to think Britain would benefit from the freedom it would give. Down the road, at Lydiard Millicent Village Hall, I went a few rounds with a group of women who start their morning with a few jabs, uppercuts and hooks. Shona Watt - who runs the training classes here - spoke for many of her clients. She and her small business have very little to do with the EU. Yet she - and they - are fearful leaving might damage other businesses in this manufacturing town, home to Honda and BMW. Less trade for them might mean less money to spend on boxing classes for professional ladies. GP Sian Edwards sees this as a debate as much about people as it is about money. In a town that does not have the doctors it needs to cover the population it has, she worries uncontrolled immigration could put an intolerable strain on the NHS - even though she knows many of those immigrants may end up working for it. What, though, she wonders, would being out be like? My last - and frankly well deserved - stop was for a doorstep bacon sarnie at Dotty's Cafe in Swindon. There, too, immigration is a key concern. Graham Rowcliffe - the cafe's owner - told me we simply couldn't control our borders while being in the EU. It is, he is certain, time to leave.   His customers on Thursday morning were much less sure. David Pedley, chief executive of GWP Group, a packaging manufacturer employing about 100 people, thinks his products would sell whether we are in or out of the EU. Getting out might just free his business of those onerous Brussels rules and regulations. But he concedes he can't be sure the rest of Europe wouldn't use Brexit to try to put up artificial barriers to stop him competing with their companies. Accountant Laurence Harrison advises many small businesses in the town. He has no doubts - being in a big European club is the way to get business in a world increasingly dominated by economic giants such as China, India and the United States.One thing united all these people - a desire to know more. But there are many already groaning at the thought of ""four more months like this"". The answer, surely, is to use that time not to listen to slogans and sound bites but to the experiences of other people and to the answers to the questions we've never before needed to ask.

2016-02-27,An unknown future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228032901/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35648948,"Earnest, passionate, and slightly shiny - the prime minister is in his element. The messy diplomacy behind him, he is selling a simple message. Whether on Andrew Marr's comfy chair, behind a podium in Downing Street or on the front bench he is campaigning, slamming home a single point we will hear over and over again. With no deviation or hesitation, but constant repetition, he is telling those thinking of voting to leave the European Union they are contemplating a ""leap in the dark"". We will have to do our best over the coming weeks to find a torch and shine a little light into the shadows. It won't be easy. In truth, no post-referendum future is picked out by a spotlight, for with an EU in crisis over migration, contemplating closer banking union, the status quo is not a steady state.  Even those who believe in historical or metaphysical predetermination do not claim to be able to follow the dark thread very far beyond the present.Follow updates on the BBC's live referendum pageThe UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowUK and the EU: Better off out or in?Remain v Leave: Where do MPs stand?I'm itching to watch the last episode of Man in the High Castle, but the European debate has kept me from the couch. It is a TV drama set in a world where the Nazis win the war and the US is conquered, and divided between them and the Japanese Empire. There is no doubt counterfactual history makes for good ""faction"". Some think it is academically pointless, others that it has some merit.I have always thought it a worthwhile tool for thinking about causes and consequences, what is shaped by heroes and villains who grip history in their hands and what is moulded by amorphous forces of the economy.  But perhaps what we need is conjectural history.Ironically, the key to what the UK would be like after leaving the EU is in the hands of the very organisation we would have just voted to leave. The reaction of the EU itself would make all the difference between an amicable divorce and a crime of passion. Discerning how 27 other governments will behave is never easy at the best of times. Predicting their reaction to a hypothetical vote in four months' time might seem as pointless as asking Schrodinger about the health of his cat. But trends will become clearer as the weeks pass. There is already a grave worry on the Continent that the British disease could be catching. The word they use is ""contagion"".  If we vote to leave, there are those in France and Germany who won't want to make it a comfortable experience. If it looks too easy, others may be encouraged to follow. The Danish People's Party is already keen. But the big worry among the elite is France. Front National leader Marine Le Pen says she would be proud to call herself ""Madame Frexit"". If Britain's departure would leave a gaping hole in the EU, France following suit would pull out the foundation stones. The EU might survive in name, but it would become a very different creature if France left, or even had the same semi-detached relationship Mr Cameron is proposing for Britain. The ""outers"" might be right that a rational EU would not want to punish and alienate the UK, but would be quick to arrange a mutually beneficial arrangement that would encourage trade to continue much as before. There may be voices raised against those who fear the spread of the British disease. I suspect we could learn much by shining that torch in the direction of German industrialists, French financiers and Dutch manufacturers  and find out what they are telling their governments. But European politicians (as well of the rest of us) might want to know what sort of Britain they would face. The ""outers"" are a campaign for a one-off vote, not a nascent government. We don't know whether a government freed to close its borders to all other Europeans would actually do so. Would there be a quota system or a points system, a free for all or an outright ban, or perhaps a bar on Bulgarians but not Belgians? There is a big difference between these positions.  We must ask those who want the choice to be available, but we cannot know for sure what they would do with their new-found freedom.At one extreme, Britain out of the EU could negotiate access to the single market, free movement of our citizens and some voice in debates. At the other end, we could need visas to visit any EU country, suffer punitive tariffs on our goods and be given the cold shoulder.As the vote grows closer, I fully expect headlines on the lines of: ""France warns UK citizens will need visas"".  There is another dark uncertainty.The prime minister has dismissed Boris Johnson's hint he favours a Leave vote followed by another negotiation, a better deal, and then a vote to stay. Other EU prime ministers and presidents are bound to be equally insistent this is a fantasy too far.The notion is certainly fraught with difficulties - not least the thought of a new Conservative leader, even a charismatic blond bombshell, executing a nimble pirouette to turn about face in defiance of a popular vote and thus deliberately reneging on the will of the people. But a pound to a pfennig someone would suggest it was worth a punt, and the mood across Europe might be in favour of making hitherto undreamt of concessions. Or they might say ""stuff it"" and leave the new leader gently rotating in the breeze. One way or another, we will be inching into the darkness in June - we will do what we can to illuminate the possible and the probable."

MPs to grill top civil servant on EU guidanceAnalysis: How will a divided government work during the campaign?The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowRemain v Leave: Where Conservatives standThe prime minister has challenged Mr Duncan Smith and other Conservative cabinet ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU to spell out their alternative vision.And Chancellor George Osborne has said so-called Brexit would cause a ""profound economic shock"" - an argument echoed by other G20 finance ministers on Saturday. But Mr Duncan Smith dismissed these claims as scare stories, saying Britain was the ""greatest country on earth"", more than capable of prospering outside the EU, which he said was more of a ""political project"" than a ""defined economic entity"".He told the Andrew Marr Show: ""I am positive about leaving the EU because I believe rather than saying it is a leap in the dark, I think it is a stride into the light. It is about hope versus pessimism and people will vote for that.""Mr Duncan Smith said the UK had ""faced bigger trials than this"". ""It has stood alone in war but it has also defined trade around the world...Britain is a phenomenal country. It has stood alone and fought for freedom. It has been a global trader, it can again be a global trader.""Why would we have such a low opinion of the British people that we going about talking about a leap in the dark and profound shocks?""Asked whether he believed the PM's argument lacked patriotism, he replied: ""It is not about personalities but the In Campaign's whole strategy has been about saying 'basically we are too small, too little, inconsequential, we can't do what we want. I don't know why anyone would want to run a country like this.""While the EU was an important trading partner, he said the level of two-way trade had been exaggerated. If the UK voted to leave the EU, he said, it would be able to negotiate a simpler trade-based relationship enabling it to have ""access to the world and to the EU"". ""We do a deal with the EU. That is a trade deal, it is about access to our markets and access to theirs. Part of our red lines would be about us being able to control our borders as we want…That deal is very doable.""The former Conservative leader also rejected suggestions that an Out vote could trigger the break up of the UK, saying the idea that it could provoke another independence referendum in Scotland was ""absurd"". Mr Duncan Smith's intervention was welcomed by the Vote Leave campaign group, which tweeted: ""All the government has is project fear - we will be explaining to people project hope, how Britain and EU will be better after we take control.""But pro-EU campaign group, Britain Stronger in Europe, said Mr Duncan Smith had failed to explain how the UK could retain access to the European single market while not upholding principles of freedom of movement. And small business minister Anna Soubry, who is campaigning to stay in the EU, said leaving would be ""chaotic"" and stall a much-needed process of economic reform.""If people vote to stay in, we will remain within a reformed EU with a wind of change I believe is blowing right across it,"" she told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.""Colleagues from other countries are really talking about the need to advance the programme of deregulation, fewer directives, that we have led.""Labour's Angela Eagle accused eurosceptics of wanting to turn the clock back to the 1970s and focusing trade strategy on the rest of the Commonwealth.""Their attention is elsewhere so we have to have to make the best of where we are,"" she told Marr.""I believe that we should be confident about our values and we can project our values if we work through international organisations and the EU is one such organisation.""

2016-02-28,Hammonds defends curbs on EU documents,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35680675,"Britain's top civil servant has been told to explain why cabinet ministers opposing EU membership are being denied access to government papers on Europe.Last week, Sir Jeremy Heywood issued guidance that the civil service would support the government to make the case for the UK to remain in a reformed EU.But it said ministers opposing the government should not be given briefing or speech material on the subject. Sir Jeremy has been called to explain this position to a committee of MPs.The cabinet secretary will appear before the cross-party Public Administration Committee on Tuesday.The UK's referendum on whether to remain in or leave the EU will be held on 23 JuneThe government's official policy is that Britain should remain in the EU - and civil servants are duty-bound to support government policies.Sir Jeremy's guidance says ministers opposing the official government line should not be given access to government papers on the referendum or Prime Minister David Cameron's EU renegotiations - apart from ones they had already seen.It has prompted claims from leave campaigners that the establishment is lined up against them. The public administration committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, who wants to leave the EU, will question whether the guidance could interfere with the business of government. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is one of the five cabinet ministers campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, along with Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Justice Secretary Michael Gove.Mr Duncan Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that constitutionally, ministers are in charge of their departments and should continue to receive official documents. ""I must have the right to continue to look at this,"" he said.Responding to suggestions he could be replaced in a cabinet reshuffle after the referendum, Mr Duncan Smith added: ""If my face no longer fits, my face no longer fits.""My big passion is welfare reform. But Europe goes over everything.""He cited concerns about the euro, border controls and migration among his reasons for wanting to leave. ""What the hell's happening with the euro? Do we really know enough about who may eventually be coming through the open borders? ""I have no idea what it looks like if we stay. The difference is, if we stay, we are bound to this ship that is heading in an unknown direction and sailing perilously close to the rocks.""In the same newspaper, however, the prime minister warned of the risks of leaving the EU. He said those campaigning to leave had been ""extremely vague"".""It's simply not good enough to assert everything will be all right when jobs and our country's future are at stake.""There is no doubt in my mind that the only certainty of exit is uncertainty; that leaving Europe is fraught with risk."""

With 95 seats filled, Fine Gael has 28 seats; Labour four; Fianna Fáil 28; Sinn Féin 13; Anti-Austerity-Alliance-People Before Profit four; the Social Democrats three; the Green Party one; the Independent Alliance four and 10 seats have gone to Independents. On Saturday, Mr Kenny - who has been re-elected in Mayo - said it was clear the existing government would not regain power.""This is a disappointment for the Fine Gael party,"" he said. He said you can ""argue about"" the people's decision, but ""you cannot argue with it"".""So clearly, the government of Fine Gael and Labour are not going to be returned to office.""He added that the ""majority government option is gone"" but he would wait for the full results and consider options on how to form a government ""very carefully"".Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin described the election as an ""extraordinary vote"" and said he was ""very pleased"".He said it would take time before it was clear what shape a new government would take.""A lot will depend on the destination of the last seats in many constituencies. It's a bit too early to be definitive, but it's clear we're going to have a good day,"" he said.Joan Burton said she was ""very, very disappointed"" that many Labour Party candidates would not be elected to parliament.""All I can say is that the Labour Party is at the fight for justice and social justice in Ireland and we will continue that fight in the next Dáil, even if our numbers are diminished.""Among the other notable candidates elected so far are Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary-Lou McDonald and Fine Gael ministers Frances Fitzgerald, Charlie Flanagan and Leo Varadkar.However, Fine Gael's former Justice Minister Alan Shatter lost his seat, as has Alex White, the Labour Party's communications minister.  Children's Minister James Reilly looks likely to lose his too.Sinn Féin, another big winner, indicated it would not go into government.The party's Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, said it had been a hugely successful election for Sinn Féin.""My sense is that a government will be formed, I don't think there will be a second election within weeks. How stable a government, that remains to be seen,"" he said. Over three million people were entitled to vote in Friday's poll, which will return 157 members of parliament, known as TDs. The ceann comhairle (speaker) is automatically returned.The campaign was fought mainly over economic issues, with the government parties asking voters for their support to keep the recovery going at a time when international storm clouds were gathering.But the opposition parties countered that not everyone, especially outside middle-class Dublin, had been benefiting from the up-turn.The Republic of Ireland has had the fastest growing economy in the eurozone for the last two years.TDs are being elected according to the single transferable vote (STV) system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to others."

And the notion that the UK leaving the EU would cause an economic shock is absurd.""Fifteen of the members of the G20 are outside the EU, and that hasn't caused an economic shock. Indeed, most of them are doing better than most of the members of the European Union.""The UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowEU vote: Where the cabinet and other MPs standEU reform deal: What Cameron wanted and what he gotUKIP leader Nigel Farage said the G20 announcement was ""no surprise"" as it was ""mates helping each other out"".""I'm not surprised that big government gets together to support David Cameron,"" he added.""This is big banks, big business, big government all scratching each other's backs. I don't think that impresses voters.""Officials travelling with Mr Osborne say the mention of the UK's referendum in the G20 meeting's final communique is unusual. Mr Osborne has denied he pushed for it.The chancellor told the BBC: ""The financial leaders of the world's biggest countries have given their unanimous verdict and they say that a British exit from the EU would be a shock to the world economy.""And if it's a shock to the world economy imagine what it would do to Britain.""He added: ""This isn't some adventurous journey into the unknown, with all the humour attached to it, this is deadly serious.""With the gleaming early spring sunshine behind him, as he stood on the bank of Shanghai's Huangpu river, the chancellor said he was ""deadly serious"".He's not the only one. It seems the other 19 leaders at the G20 agree about the ""shock"", as they've called it, if the UK walked out of the EU.It's not a big surprise. The president of hosts China made it clear last year during his Chequers stay that he wants Britain In.But then again China doesn't really do intervention in domestic politics.George Osborne will be pleased to have this significant and very public diplomatic backing as he sits on the plane back home tonight.There's a whiff of the Scottish referendum campaign about it though, when various foreign leaders lined up behind the government position.A senior official from the Treasury told the BBC the chancellor's US counterpart had raised the issue during the meeting, as did others, including senior Chinese officials and Ms Lagarde.US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew later urged UK voters to ""consider the impact"" of voting to leave, and said the White House believed it was in the UK's ""national security interests"" to remain in the union.  Elsewhere, Prime Minister David Cameron was in Northern Ireland as part of his UK tour to persuade voters that membership of a reformed EU is in their best interests.CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn described the potential consequences of the UK leaving the EU as an ""evident risk"".""Those who wish to leave must put forward a clear economic case, explaining how being outside the EU will enhance jobs, growth and prosperity in the UK and across Europe.""The majority - but not all - of CBI members want the UK to remain in a reformed EU,"" she added.Meanwhile, London Mayor Boris Johnson has clarified his position over the idea that a vote to leave the EU could force Brussels to give Britain a better deal over its membership and trigger a second referendum.Mr Johnson had previously suggested that only by voting to leave would the UK ""get the change we need"".But in The Times, Mr Johnson stated categorically: ""Out is out"".The UK will vote on whether to leave or remain in the EU on 23 June.Mr Cameron set the date last weekend after agreeing a deal with fellow EU leaders about a renegotiation of the UK's EU membership.

""I believe that the true figures actually would shock us,"" he told the conference.""Mass migration into Britain on this scale is not good for our country.""It is not good for our quality of life, it is not good for social cohesion in our society, and our population inexorably headed towards 70m or 75m will not make this a better, richer or happier place to be.""But as EU members there is nothing we can do about it.""He warned that expansion of EU membership - potentially to Bosnia and Turkey - would add to concerns over immigration, saying: ""If we remain members of the EU it is a perfectly reasonable, sane thing to say that our migration crisis will get worse.""And he said remaining inside the union could leave the UK vulnerable to a Paris-style terror attack, or a repeat of the sexual harassment reported in Cologne.""Surely one of the first duties of the British government should be to do everything within their power to protect our people from the horrors that we saw in Paris and the indignities that we saw in Cologne.""The best and the safest way for us to attempt to prevent such things is to leave the EU and to take back control of our borders.""

Where peace is possible in so many places.""You don't achieve peace by planning for war, grabbing resources and not respecting each other's human rights.""He added: ""Today's demonstration is an expression of many people's opinions and views. I'm here because I believe in a nuclear-free Britain and a nuclear-free future.""Mr Corbyn has asked shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to carry out a review of Labour defence policy, including its stance on Trident renewal.The Labour leader supports unilateral disarmament but some members of the shadow cabinet, including shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, are in favour of Trident.SNP leader Ms Sturgeon said the norm in the world today was to be nuclear-free.""It is the exception to the rule to possess nuclear weapons, let that message ring out loudly and clearly,""  she said.""The use of Trident nuclear weapons would bring about human devastation and suffering on an unimaginable scale.""Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: ""The world has been and continues to be an unstable and unpredictable place but there are some values that we should hold on to through peace, through war, through instability and unpredictability.""It is never acceptable, it is never justifiable to unleash weapons of mass destruction on a population. Nuclear weapons belong in the dustbin of history alongside the Cold War.""Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas described nuclear weapons as ""a Cold War relic"".""To contemplate using nuclear weapons is both illegal and immoral,"" she said.Actress and campaigner Vanessa Redgrave also spoke at the Stop Trident event, which was organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.Supporters say Trident is indispensable for protecting the UK's security, and the nuclear defence industry is also a major employer. Replacing Trident was a Conservative manifesto pledge at the general election.A Commons vote on Trident renewal is expected to be held later this year."

But in The Times, Mr Johnson stated categorically: ""Out is out"".Meanwhile finance ministers from G20 countries have raised concerns with the chancellor about a possible Brexit. The UK will vote on whether to Leave or Remain in the EU on 23 June. How plausible is second EU referendum?Mr Johnson wrote in his Daily Telegraph column on Monday that ""EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says 'no' "". This claim was widely interpreted as suggesting he would then advocate a second referendum.But on Saturday, Mr Johnson said in the Times: ""What I want is to get out and then negotiate a series of trade arrangements around the world."" Asked whether he had given up on the idea of a second referendum, Mr Johnson added: ""I don't think it would be necessary.""He told the paper the vote was a golden opportunity ""to take back control, to renew our approach to law making, to strike new trade deals around the world, to galvanise our economy and politics and to give people confidence back in their country"".""The advantage of a 'no' vote is that it would jolt the whole system in Europe,"" he said. ""For their own sake, they need to look at the way they are doing things.""Chinese and American officials and the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, discussed the referendum with Chancellor George Osborne on Friday in Shanghai during the G20 summit, where finance ministers from the world's biggest economies discuss key issues in the global economy.   The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the ministers were expected to raise an official warning of the risks of an Out vote when the final communique of their meeting was published later.  Lord Howard, who led the Tories between 2003 and 2005, said on Friday that EU leaders would have to think again about far-reaching reform in the immediate aftermath of an Out vote.The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the suggestion an Out vote could lead to a second referendum had the political advantage of reassuring voters who were tempted to leave the EU but were nervous about the potential consequences. But Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed the idea as a ""complete fiction"".He added: ""It is a very simple question on the ballot paper - you either stay in the EU or you leave.""Chancellor George Osborne has said if Britain voted to leave the EU it would cause a profound economic shock.He said it was the ""very worst time"" for Britain to take such an ""enormous economic gamble""."

He said she was ""recording the sound of bombs"" from Turkish forces falling on a Kurdish area of Sur in Diyarbakir.The area is a flashpoint in the conflict between the Turkish government and the country's Kurdish population.Ms McGarry, who was visiting Turkey as part of a delegation to the country, revealed she was ""very pleased"" to have landed at Heathrow airport. Writing in a series of tweets on Saturday, she said: ""I was forcibly removed from the street by a man who pushed me repeatedly and would've hit me but for intervention of younger colleagues.""I was denied access to an interpreter and taken into a shack behind the demarcation line which was filled with guns.""She said she was ""relieved"" after an interpreter was allowed in after 45 minutes.She continued: ""My absolute admiration to fellow delegates who stayed to support me & were increasingly worried by the shouting & swearing.""Thank you also to the British Embassy who acted so swiftly to help secure my release. And everyone locally who was contacted & put pressure.""Thanks also to the Kurdish population of Sur who came to welcome me out and hugged me when I cried. And they brought me chai and thanks.""Ms McGarry added: ""I freely admit to crying when I was released. It was a terrifying experience albeit it only lasted a couple of hours.""I cannot imagine if life was a constant struggle of fear like that everyday which is why Turkey's Nato partners need to demand it stop.""Ms McGarry sits as an independent MP. She withdrew from the SNP whip at Westminster in November after the Women for Independence group called in police over allegations that campaign funds appeared to have gone missing. She has denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this year, the MP was involved in a high-profile Twitter spat with Harry Potter author JK Rowling."
2016-02-28,School calls police over 'UKIP boy',https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-35671519,"School staff called police when a pupil looked at a UKIP website and an English Defence League video in class. Mick Taylor said his 15-year-old son was asked by police whether he was a UKIP activist, and has described police action as inappropriate.The procedure left him feeling ""like a terrorist"", Mr Taylor added.Police said Wildern School in Hedge End, Hampshire, acted in line with safeguarding procedures. UKIP said: ""We're certainly not extremists.""Under the new counter terror act, staff at schools are asked to identify children who may be influenced by extremist material.The school said it called 101 for advice after a student was viewing a range of different sites and was referred to a specialist team.""If my son had been accessing these websites on a regular basis - then maybe there would be cause for concern,"" Mr Taylor said.""But it's a one-off incident and I don't think it merited such an extreme section of the police coming in.""Head teacher Marie-Louise Litton said: ""I wish to make it absolutely clear that the decision to pursue the matter further was not made by the school.""A spokesman from Hampshire Constabulary said: ""The school contacted us in good faith and in complete accordance with their safeguarding procedures. ""We have a duty to respond to these concerns and we spoke to the pupil and his father informally about comments and internet usage at school."" No further action was taken.UKIP's deputy leader Paul Nuttall reacted angrily at the suggestion the party's website was flagged in this way. ""I don't know how you can be extremists when you have 22 MEPs, a member of Parliament, three lords and 500 councillors all over the country,"" he said. ""We're certainly not extremists."" "
2016-02-28,Party backs having more women candidates,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35678350,"The Scottish Liberal Democrats have backed plans to increase the number of female candidates in future parliamentary elections. The party's conference voted to ensure women were selected in the five most winnable Westminster seats and five of the 10 most winnable Holyrood seats. Leader Willie Rennie personally pushed for the change.The move will not affect the male-dominated candidate selection for this May's Scottish Parliament election.Delegates also confirmed that the lead candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election would be a woman.Following the conference decision, Mr Rennie said: ""Passing these proposals sends a powerful message that we are changing. This represents a big shift and will open up opportunities for new women candidates. ""And it is working already with new women now considering standing for parliament for the first time.""We have bold, positive and ambitious plans for the next five years and we will now be joined by people from a much more diverse range of backgrounds as we take them forwards.""As the leader of this progressive party I am delighted that we have embraced change that means we can be more like the people we are seeking to represent.""The Scottish Liberal Democrats are holding their two-day annual conference at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh."
2016-02-28,Osborne warns of further spending cuts,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35672158,"Chancellor George Osborne has warned he may have to make fresh cuts to public spending in next month's Budget.Mr Osborne told the BBC global economic turmoil and slower growth meant ""we may need to undertake further reductions"".He slowed the pace of cuts in the last spending review, but suggested savings could be announced in his 16 March Budget statement as figures showed the UK economy was smaller than expected.Labour's John McDonnell said it was ""a total humiliation"" for Mr Osborne.Speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg during a visit to China, Mr Osborne said he would rather look for extra cuts now than risk breaking his own manifesto commitment to achieve a surplus in the budget by the end of this Parliament, in 2020. The chancellor did not completely rule out raising taxes in the event of a further slowdown in growth, but said now was not the time for ""significant"" tax hikes. He would not spell out the details of any further cuts, but said the Conservatives would stick to their manifesto pledge to protect some government departments. It is understood he would not look to increase the level of cuts dramatically but would initially seek to make further efficiencies in government departments. Mr Osborne said he wanted to ""root our country in the principle that we live within our means"" and would address this in the Budget. Explaining why he was planning to make further savings, the chancellor said the global economy had got ""markedly worse"", the UK's economy needed to be more productive, and information from the Office for National Statistics showed it was also smaller than expected.He said: ""Because of all of those things, we have to respond to those events. ""So that's what our plan is rooted in and it may require further reductions in spending. ""I'll address that in the Budget but people should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure.""He went on to say the ""whole purpose of our economic plan was to have a budget surplus"".By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorThe chancellor wants to keep to his self-imposed rule of getting the books into surplus by the end of the Parliament. He could relax that rule and slow down the pace of the cuts but that's not what appears to be on his agenda. Instead, it seems he'd rather find the money somewhere. He wouldn't say where he'd look for cuts, but you can assume departments ministers have already pledged to protect will be safe from further austerity. That of course means potentially tighter squeezes elsewhere. Read more from LauraLaura Kuenssberg: Osborne's change of EU tacticsDecisions about the level of potential future cuts will only be made once he receives the official assessments from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he added.The extra cuts would be likely to be made towards the end of the Parliament, before 2020. In his November statement, Mr Osborne watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments.He was able to do this due to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that by 2020 Mr Osborne would be thinking about potentially being prime minister and leading the Conservatives into the next general election.Mr Osborne believed having a surplus would show voters the Conservatives had ""fixed the economy"", he added.       Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the British people would end up paying for Mr Osborne's own failures.He accused the chancellor of having ""sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months - that his recovery is built on sand"".""Far from paying our way, Osborne's short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world,"" he said.""If the bankers' chancellor had been doing his job properly he would be collecting taxes from Google and other tax-dodgers. ""Instead he is threatening the British people with paying an even higher price for his own failures."""
2016-02-28,MPs in line for a 1.3% pay rise,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35667715,"MPs are to receive a 1.3% pay rise from April, taking their salary to £74,962. This is on top of a 10% rise decided in August and backdated to the general election.The latest increase is an annual adjustment decided by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which takes into account average public sector pay rises.It is slightly higher than the 1% public sector pay cap introduced by Chancellor George Osborne.Ipsa says this is due to the fact it uses Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures as its benchmark. An Ipsa spokesman said: ""The ONS index takes account of promotions and bonuses which may explain why the figure is higher than the 1% wider public sector pay policy."""

2016-02-28,Who's who: Labour shadow cabinet in full,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35239660,"Here is a full list of Labour's shadow cabinet, following party leader Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.Leader of the Opposition - Jeremy CorbynThe veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident. Deputy leader, party chair and shadow Cabinet Office minister - Tom WatsonA former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela EagleAngela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.Shadow chancellor - John McDonnellThe veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would ""swim through vomit"" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would ""like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher"".He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be ""honoured"" for taking part in their ""armed struggle"", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Shadow chief Treasury secretary - Seema MalhotraSeema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.Shadow home secretary - Andy BurnhamDefeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to ""unite and to take on the Tories"".Shadow foreign secretary - Hilary BennHilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.Opposition chief whip - Rosie WintertonA former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership.  She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.Shadow health secretary - Heidi AlexanderA former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.Shadow education secretary -  Lucy PowellThe Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign.

Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen. Shadow lord chancellor, shadow justice secretary - Lord Falconer of ThorotonLord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.

2016-02-28,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2016-02-28,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union to be held on Thursday 23 June. This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide - and a chance to ask other questions, a selection of which we'll be answering at the bottom of the page. A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners guide to how the EU works.Here's a video explaining how the EU works in less than two minutesThe question is always crucial in any referendum. The Electoral Commission proposed the wording, which has been accepted by MPs: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" The options for voters will be 'Remain a member of the European Union' and 'Leave the European Union'. Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a Greek exit from the EU was dubbed Grexit in the past.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.It will be a similar system to that during other elections. Firstly, if you have registered to vote, you'll be sent a card telling you when voting takes place and where you should go to vote on 23 June. On that day, when you go to the polling station you will be given a piece of paper with the referendum question on it. You then go to a booth, which will have a pencil in it for your use. You then put a X in the box which reflects your choice and put the paper into a ballot box. Alternatively you will also be able to opt to vote by post. Read more: Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.Mr Cameron agreed a package of changes to the UK's membership of the EU after two days of intensive talks with other member states' leaders in Brussels in February. The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, includes changes to:Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.On financial regulation, a clause was inserted ""to ensure the level-playing field within the internal market"". This was in response to French fears that Britain was seeking special protection for the City of London that would have given it a competitive advantage. Critics argue that the final deal falls well short of what Mr Cameron originally promised when he announced his plan for a referendum, particularly when it comes to returning powers from Brussels. It is not clear, for example, if the ""red card"" for national parliaments would ever be triggered in practice.But most of the points in the draft agreement, with the exception of those mentioned above, have survived unchanged into the final deal. Read more: What Cameron wanted v what he gotBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.The British public are fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP are also in favour of leaving. They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and any ultimate goal to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, now he has got some powers back from it. Sixteen on his cabinet also back staying in. The Conservative Party has pledged to be neutral in the campaign - but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are all in favour of staying in. As mentioned above, according to polls, the public seems pretty evenly split on the issue.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the bloc.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, a recent CBI president, says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission is in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. It will select a designated lead campaign for both the ""leave"" and ""remain"" sides. The official campaigns will get access to a grant of up to £600,000, an overall spending limit of £7m, campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and free access to meeting rooms. Other groups are free to run their own campaigns but they will be limited to a spend of £700,000 if they register with the Electoral Commission and will have to report the source of donations. If they don't register with the Commission they will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The Electoral Commission has published a guide to the rules.The spending limit for political parties depend on the percentage of the vote they received at the general election. The Conservatives have the highest spending limit - £7m - because they got the most votes at the general election. Labour is limited to £5.5m, UKIP £4m and the Lib Dems £3m. The SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and other parties that got less than 5% of votes cast in May will be limited to £700,000.This has yet to be decided - but here are the main groups of either side of the argument. Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It is seen as certain to get the official Electoral Commission designation to head the Remain campaign.Vote Leave campaign - A cross-party campaign that grew out of Business for Britain, headed by former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson. Key figures include former Conservative adviser Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign and has the backing of the five cabinet ministers and other Conservatives such as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel. It also has the backing of Labour Leave, which is headed by Labour donor John Mills.Grassroots Out Movement - An umbrella group including the relatively new Grassroots Out group - founded by Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove and Labour MP Kate Hoey in January - and Leave.EU. Funded by UKIP donor Arron Banks and other business people, it has the backing of longstanding Eurosceptic groups, some Conservative MPs and UKIP, plus others such as the former Respect MP George Galloway. The Electoral Commission is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign within weeks of the referendum date being announced. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version..Yes, is the answer to this question from William from West Sussex. All the votes will be counted and then added up, with a straight majority needed to provide the result. In answer to some other people's questions, there is no minimum turnout needed. So if, for the sake of argument, only three people voted on the day, if two of them voted to leave, that would be the result.The good news for Dean from West Sussex - and the many others of you who asked the same question - is that you will be able to vote by post, as people can in local and general elections.  Here's the Electoral Commission's guide to applying to vote by post.In answer to a question from John, from Lewes, counts will get under way when polls close at 22:00 GMT Thursday, 23 June at 382 local centres around the UK. These local results will be declared as the counts are completed before being collated at 12 regional centres, which will also declare the totals for each side. A chief counting officer will then announce the overall result at Manchester Town Hall.Lots of people asked about this. A lot would depend on the kind of deal the UK agreed with the EU after exit. If it remained within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, as UKIP wants, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.As explained in the answer above, it would depend on whether the UK government decided to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Duncan, from Chippenham, wanted to know if the UK could deport terror suspects to their own countries to face charges without being overruled by the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR) in Strasbourg. The EHCR is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU would not exempt the UK from its decisions.The UK government is, however, committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, David Cameron is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the EHCR.Pauline, from Shipston on Stour, asked this one. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.It is up the UK government to decide whether or not to keep the pound or switch to the euro. The deal David Cameron struck with the EU included recognition that the UK has no plans to switch to the euro currency.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about £24m a day or about 1.4% of total public annual spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget. Some leave campaigners say the UK sends £55m a day to the EU but that is based on gross figures, which is a fair approximation of the UK's ""membership fee"" but does not take rebates and money back into account.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what would happen to his retirement plans if Britain votes to leave the EU. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain leaves the EU but remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.The short answer is that we'll find out on 24 June! John Wilkinson wrote to ask whether we are in for a repeat of the general election when the opinion polls underestimated support for one side, the Conservatives, and overstated support for the other, Labour. As Mr Wilkinson points out, research suggests younger people are more likely to vote to remain in the EU, while older voters tend to favour out. But as a general rule, older people are more likely to vote in elections than younger people. The ""don't knows"" are also running at between 17% and 20%. Prof John Curtice, who supervised the general election exit poll, has also noticed a difference between polls conducted online, which suggest the race is close, and ones conducted over the telephone, which put the Remain campaign ahead. Opinion polling is not an exact science - for more information on the latest referendum polls and analysis by Prof Curtice, visit the National Centre for Social Research's What UK thinks site.Jude wanted to know if his Peruvian girlfriend, who is a British citizen but has been living in Peru for five years, can take part in the referendum. The answer is yes, if she has appeared on the UK electoral register in the past 15 years. This was a question asked by many people. The minimum period after a vote to leave would be two years. During that time Britain would continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making, as it negotiated a withdrawal agreement and the terms of its relationship with the now 27 nation bloc. In practice it may take longer than two years, depending on how the negotiations go. Michael, from East Sussex asks an intriguing question - could the necessary legislation pass the Commons if all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservative MPs were in favour of staying?The answer is that technically MPs could block an EU exit - but it would be seen as political suicide to go against the will of the people as expressed in a referendum. The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.It adds: ""If the Commons resolves against ratification, the treaty can still be ratified if the Government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the House of Commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days (this process can be repeated ad infinitum)."" In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats if Britain left. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After a leave vote, the government would probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers are likely to get back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details have not been worked out.HM Revenue and Customs have suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving is likely to be significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments will be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron has said that as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" is applied. The DWP estimates between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts will be phased in. New arrivals will not get tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but will gradually gain access to them over a four year period at a rate yet to be decided.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""No, we would not be barred. All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""Brendan, from London, wonders whether Commonwealth citizens need to have been granted indefinite leave to remain to get a vote. The Electoral Commission guidelines say: ""Any type of leave to enter or remain is acceptable, whether indefinite, time limited or conditional."" That means all citizens of India, Australia, Pakistan, Canada and 48 other Commonwealth nations who are living in the UK can take part (provided they are old enough and are on the electoral register). As can citizens of British overseas territories, such as the Falkland Islands, Bermuda or Gibraltar, if they are currently residing in the UK. Here is a full list of Commonwealth countries.No. The rules are the same as at last year's general election, when EU citizens were also barred from taking part."

2016-02-28,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Leave campaigners say: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape with small-and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Remain campaigners say: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK..Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP, although it does not take into account as wide a range of factors as the Open Europe study.Leave campaigners say: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce migration numbers. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services, they say. Remain campaigners say: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, pro-EU campaigners argue, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out - only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. Calculating how much EU membership costs the UK is not straightforward. The EU financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December, whereas the UK's runs from 1 April to 31 March, meaning there are different figures in circulation.The UK also gets an annual rebate and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, among other things.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. To put that in context, it is about 1.4% of total public spending - slightly less than the energy and climate change department's annual budget.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.Leave campaigners say: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Remain campaigners say: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Leave campaigners say: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Remain campaigners say: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Leave campaigners say: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Remain campaigners say: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Leave campaigners say: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. That means it would be possible to impose the same entry restrictions on EU citizens as those currently faced by people from outside the EU. But leave campaigners say that citizens of other EU countries already living in the UK would not be deported and could be given ""indefinite leave to remain"". They cite a 1969 treaty signed by the UK which says rights built up over time by individuals cannot be revoked by new treaties. This also means that British expats living in EU countries would not be forced to return to the UK, they say, dismissing claims to the contrary as ""scaremongering"". Remain campaigners say: One of the major advantages of EU membership is the ability to live and work in other member states without having to apply for work permits or visas. About 2.2 million British citizens live in other EU nations, according to the most recent UK government estimates, with Spain playing host to the highest number of British expats, followed by France and Ireland. If Britain left it could become harder to do this.  Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned that British expats in the EU would be regarded as ""illegal immigrants"" if Britain left both the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights without keeping free movement as part of a new trade agreement. Leave campaigners say: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Remain campaigners say: ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European Observer newspaper in an editorial.Leave campaigners say: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Remain campaigners say: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2016-02-28,Toasting good health,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35679377,"A referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union is to be held on Thursday, 23 June, David Cameron has confirmed. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Leave campaigners say: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations.Some potential models:Many of those campaigning for exit argue that none of the country-based models would work for the UK.They want a Free Trade Agreement which would not involve the UK accepting the supremacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the free movement of people or the requirement to pay significant amounts into the EU budget.Given the fact that there is already full regulatory compliance between the UK and EU, they say it would be easier to negotiate than past trade deals.They point to Canada, which recently signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the EU, which is set to eliminate trade barriers in most areas but does not require free movement or budgetary contributions, as an example of what is possible. Remain campaigners say: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed and have to pay to access the single market. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business. The end result could be a trade war between Britain and the EU, some have warned, which could cripple Britain's export industries.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit.

2016-02-28,The EU questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35660681,"How does being in the EU affect me? What difference would it make to me and my life if we left?Let's be honest, few of us have ever had to give much, if any, thought to these questions. The fact we are members of a club of 28 nations is something most people take as a given - like the weather. However, now they are beginning to be asked as people to ponder how to vote in the EU referendum.I spent the early hours of Thursday morning in Swindon to learn how people were approaching one of the most significant decisions this country has faced in decades. As dawn rose over the frosty fields that surround Brinkworth Dairy, I stood by the cowshed with Ceri Cryer and her husband, Chad. Like all farmers, their lives and their livelihoods are closely linked to policies made in Brussels. The grants they receive - for keeping hedgerows in shape or for other environmentally friendly policies - are set by the EU. The rules that govern the hygiene of their dairy and the packaging of the cheese they make are set there too. Yet Ceri and Chad have very different views. She thinks there's no reason to imagine that if the rules and regulations were set in London they'd be any less strict. What's more, she fears farming would receive less, not more, support without the lobbying of countries such as France and Poland with long, proud traditions of supporting the rural economy. He, on the other hand, thinks there's no reason to doubt their farm would receive the same backing as it does now if the UK left the EU and every reason to think Britain would benefit from the freedom it would give. Down the road, at Lydiard Millicent Village Hall, I went a few rounds with a group of women who start their morning with a few jabs, uppercuts and hooks. Shona Watt - who runs the training classes here - spoke for many of her clients. She and her small business have very little to do with the EU. Yet she - and they - are fearful leaving might damage other businesses in this manufacturing town, home to Honda and BMW. Less trade for them might mean less money to spend on boxing classes for professional ladies. GP Sian Edwards sees this as a debate as much about people as it is about money. In a town that does not have the doctors it needs to cover the population it has, she worries uncontrolled immigration could put an intolerable strain on the NHS - even though she knows many of those immigrants may end up working for it. What, though, she wonders, would being out be like? My last - and frankly well deserved - stop was for a doorstep bacon sarnie at Dotty's Cafe in Swindon. There, too, immigration is a key concern. Graham Rowcliffe - the cafe's owner - told me we simply couldn't control our borders while being in the EU. It is, he is certain, time to leave.   His customers on Thursday morning were much less sure. David Pedley, chief executive of GWP Group, a packaging manufacturer employing about 100 people, thinks his products would sell whether we are in or out of the EU. Getting out might just free his business of those onerous Brussels rules and regulations. But he concedes he can't be sure the rest of Europe wouldn't use Brexit to try to put up artificial barriers to stop him competing with their companies. Accountant Laurence Harrison advises many small businesses in the town. He has no doubts - being in a big European club is the way to get business in a world increasingly dominated by economic giants such as China, India and the United States.One thing united all these people - a desire to know more. But there are many already groaning at the thought of ""four more months like this"". The answer, surely, is to use that time not to listen to slogans and sound bites but to the experiences of other people and to the answers to the questions we've never before needed to ask.

2016-02-28,An unknown future,https://web.archive.org//web/20160228151953/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35648948,"Earnest, passionate, and slightly shiny - the prime minister is in his element. The messy diplomacy behind him, he is selling a simple message. Whether on Andrew Marr's comfy chair, behind a podium in Downing Street or on the front bench he is campaigning, slamming home a single point we will hear over and over again. With no deviation or hesitation, but constant repetition, he is telling those thinking of voting to leave the European Union they are contemplating a ""leap in the dark"". We will have to do our best over the coming weeks to find a torch and shine a little light into the shadows. It won't be easy. In truth, no post-referendum future is picked out by a spotlight, for with an EU in crisis over migration, contemplating closer banking union, the status quo is not a steady state.  Even those who believe in historical or metaphysical predetermination do not claim to be able to follow the dark thread very far beyond the present.Follow updates on the BBC's live referendum pageThe UK's EU referendum: All you need to knowUK and the EU: Better off out or in?Remain v Leave: Where do MPs stand?I'm itching to watch the last episode of Man in the High Castle, but the European debate has kept me from the couch. It is a TV drama set in a world where the Nazis win the war and the US is conquered, and divided between them and the Japanese Empire. There is no doubt counterfactual history makes for good ""faction"". Some think it is academically pointless, others that it has some merit.I have always thought it a worthwhile tool for thinking about causes and consequences, what is shaped by heroes and villains who grip history in their hands and what is moulded by amorphous forces of the economy.  But perhaps what we need is conjectural history.Ironically, the key to what the UK would be like after leaving the EU is in the hands of the very organisation we would have just voted to leave. The reaction of the EU itself would make all the difference between an amicable divorce and a crime of passion. Discerning how 27 other governments will behave is never easy at the best of times. Predicting their reaction to a hypothetical vote in four months' time might seem as pointless as asking Schrodinger about the health of his cat. But trends will become clearer as the weeks pass. There is already a grave worry on the Continent that the British disease could be catching. The word they use is ""contagion"".  If we vote to leave, there are those in France and Germany who won't want to make it a comfortable experience. If it looks too easy, others may be encouraged to follow. The Danish People's Party is already keen. But the big worry among the elite is France. Front National leader Marine Le Pen says she would be proud to call herself ""Madame Frexit"". If Britain's departure would leave a gaping hole in the EU, France following suit would pull out the foundation stones. The EU might survive in name, but it would become a very different creature if France left, or even had the same semi-detached relationship Mr Cameron is proposing for Britain. The ""outers"" might be right that a rational EU would not want to punish and alienate the UK, but would be quick to arrange a mutually beneficial arrangement that would encourage trade to continue much as before. There may be voices raised against those who fear the spread of the British disease. I suspect we could learn much by shining that torch in the direction of German industrialists, French financiers and Dutch manufacturers  and find out what they are telling their governments. But European politicians (as well of the rest of us) might want to know what sort of Britain they would face. The ""outers"" are a campaign for a one-off vote, not a nascent government. We don't know whether a government freed to close its borders to all other Europeans would actually do so. Would there be a quota system or a points system, a free for all or an outright ban, or perhaps a bar on Bulgarians but not Belgians? There is a big difference between these positions.  We must ask those who want the choice to be available, but we cannot know for sure what they would do with their new-found freedom.At one extreme, Britain out of the EU could negotiate access to the single market, free movement of our citizens and some voice in debates. At the other end, we could need visas to visit any EU country, suffer punitive tariffs on our goods and be given the cold shoulder.As the vote grows closer, I fully expect headlines on the lines of: ""France warns UK citizens will need visas"".  There is another dark uncertainty.The prime minister has dismissed Boris Johnson's hint he favours a Leave vote followed by another negotiation, a better deal, and then a vote to stay. Other EU prime ministers and presidents are bound to be equally insistent this is a fantasy too far.The notion is certainly fraught with difficulties - not least the thought of a new Conservative leader, even a charismatic blond bombshell, executing a nimble pirouette to turn about face in defiance of a popular vote and thus deliberately reneging on the will of the people. But a pound to a pfennig someone would suggest it was worth a punt, and the mood across Europe might be in favour of making hitherto undreamt of concessions. Or they might say ""stuff it"" and leave the new leader gently rotating in the breeze. One way or another, we will be inching into the darkness in June - we will do what we can to illuminate the possible and the probable."
